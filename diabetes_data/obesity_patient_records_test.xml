HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/ PROBLEM:
Persistent pulmonary
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure. On 1/7/06 , shortly after
her admission to the medical floor , the patient was noted to be
in respiratory distress with tachypnea , accessory muscle use and
oxygen saturation of 68% on 6 liters nasal cannula. She was
placed on a nonrebreather. Her oxygen saturation increased to
93%; however , she continued to be in respiratory distress with
tachypnea and accessory muscle use. She was intubated and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation and management. Her respiratory failure was thought
to be secondary to pneumonia with a component of superimposed
volume overload. She was treated with a 10-day course of
vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime as well as with IV
Lasix. She underwent a code green on 7/30/06 during an ETT tube
change , wherein a patent airway was transiently loss. The
patient was slow to wean from the ventilator. Her chest imaging
revealed persistent bilateral opacifications. It was thought
that after an initial infectious insult , the patient developed
ARDS. On 9/14/06 , the patient underwent bronchoscopy and BAL
revealing MRSA and HSV. The patient was treated with a 10-day
course of acyclovir for presumed HSV tracheobronchitis. Given
her inability to be weaned from the vent , the patient underwent a
tracheostomy on 4/17/06 .  Post-tracheostomy , the patient
alternated between pressure support ventilation with low driving
pressure and PEEP with a trach collar..
Infectious disease:
1. Fevers. From 1/7/06 to 7/28/06 , the patient was treated
with vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime for hospital
acquired pneumonia. After discontinuation of her antibiotics ,
the patient continued to spike fevers and evidence of
leukocytosis. In verification into source of her fevers included
serial blood cultures , urine cultures and C-dif. Positive data
included: 7/28/06 , urine culture with yeast , 7/28/06 , blood
culture with coag-negative staph , 9/14/06 BAL washings with HSV ,
9/14/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 7/11/06 , blood
culture with coag-negative staph , 2/29/06 , urine culture with
yeast , 2/29/06 BAL washings with MRSA , 10/28/06 urine with yeast
urine with yeast , 10/28/06 , 6/23/06 , 4/17/06 , and 10/11/06
sputum with MRSA. 7/28/06 , chest CT with bilateral
opacification in the lung parenchyma. 2/29/06 facial CT with
left sphenoid maxillary thickening. 2/29/06 chest CT with
bilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. Of note , a
2/29/06 abdominal CT showed no evidence of abdominal infection ,
2/29/06 TTE showed no obvious vegetations , and 10/11/06 tap of
the right knee grew no organisms. In light of the data above ,
the patient&apos;s indwelling catheters were changed. She underwent
treatment with linezolid x7 days for MRSA line infection. She
also underwent treatment with acyclovir x10 days for HSV
tracheobronchitis. The aforementioned antibiosis was mostly
prophylactic. It was thought that the patient&apos;s intermittent
fevers were not infectious , but rather reflected a drug allergy ,
most likely to vancomycin. This hypothesis was supported by a
robust eosinophilia coinciding with vancomycin administration.
Shortly after vancomycin discontinuation , the patient&apos;s fevers
resolved. The patient was afebrile for greater than 48 hours off
all antibiotics prior to transfer to rehabilitation.
Cardiovascular:
1. Volume status. The patient&apos;s admission weight was 106.2 kg.
It is unclear what her dry weight was. Given that pulmonary
edema was thought to be contributing to the patient&apos;s slow
ventilator wean , she was diuresed with a combination of Lasix and
Diuril followed by combinations of torsemide and Diuril. Her
discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. Her diuretic regimen on
discharge with torsemide 100 mg IV t.i.d. and Diuril 500 mg IV
t.i.d. The patient&apos;s diuretic regimen will need be adjusted as
her intake is adjusted. Her creatinine will need to be monitored
very closely. Her weight will need to be checked daily.
2. Pump: The patient underwent echocardiogram on 11/19/06 ,
7/17/06 , and 2/29/06 .  On the whole , these studies revealed an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , concentric LVH , global hypokinesis
with regional variation , mild left atrial enlargement , mild
tricuspid regurgitation , a question of mild atrial stenosis , and
pulmonary artery pressures in the 40s. For her heart failure ,
the patient was treated with Lopressor and diuretics as above.
She was not started on an ACE inhibitor given her allergy
( cough ). She was started on low-dose ARB.
3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease status post three-vessel CABG and subsequent
single-vessel PPI. She has an RCA stenosis , 70-80% that has not
intervened upon. On admission , in the setting of respiratory
distress , the patient was in sinus tachycardia with rate related
to lateral ST depressions. Her cardiac biomarkers were positive
consistent with NSTEMI. It was thought that the patient
experienced demand ischemia rather than an acute plaque rupture.
On 10/8/06 , her troponin peaked at 8.53 , her CK at 275 , and her
MB of 16.3. The patient was treated with aspirin , Lopressor , and
Zocor. She was not started on an ACE inhibitor as detailed
above. She will likely warrant Cardiology followup with possible
RCA revascularization.
Neuro:
1. Sedation: While intubated , the patient was treated with IV
Versed and fentanyl titrated to light sedation. After her
tracheostomy , the patient&apos;s Versed and fentanyl drips were
discontinued. She was treated with Seroquel at bedtime to
preclude nighttime agitation. Her QTC should be monitored while
on Seroquel.
GI:
1. FEN: The patient initially received tube feeds via feeding
tube. She underwent a PEG placement on 4/17/06 .  She continued
on tube feeds. She also passed speech and Swallow and was thus
started on p.o. feeds with aspiration precautions. She also
received supplemental multivitamins , calcium carbonate , and
cholecalciferol. The patient will require speech and swallow
evaluation at rehabilitation. Now that she is awake , she may be
able to tolerate oral feeds with aspiration precautions.
2. Bowel regimen. The patient was treated with Colace , senna ,
and Dulcolax.
Heme:
1. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia. She
was continued on iron and folate. She may benefit from an
outpatient colonoscopy if she has not had one recently.
2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: On 4/24/06 , the patient
was noted to have bleeding from her tracheostomy site. She had
no hematocrit drop. She remained hemodynamically stable. She
underwent a bronchoscopy , which showed no active bleeding. Her
mild bleeding was thought to relate to suction trauma. Her
prophylactic heparin was held x1 day. It was thought that the
patient should be discharged on prophylactic heparin because her
DVT risk is so high. Should the patient have intense bleeding
from the tracheostomy site , a hematocrit drop or hemodynamic
changes. Her heparin subcu should be discontinued , her
hematocrit should be monitored closely , and she should be
transfused as needed. She should also at that point probably
undergo reevaluation by Pulmonary or Thoracics.
Endocrine:
1. Diabetes: The patient was treated with Lantus plus regular
insulin q. 6h. plus sliding scale insulin while she was on tube
feeds. Her insulin was changed on the night prior to discharge.
She was started on Lantus 100 subq b.i.d. She got her first dose
of 100 units subq on the evening prior to discharge , her morning
sugars were in the mid 100s. Her blood sugars should be followed
closely on the first one or two days at rehab. The blood sugars
should be monitored every 2-3 hours and her insulin should be
adjusted accordingly. Her insulin dose should be adjusted if her
tube feeds are cycled rather than given continuously or if she is
NPO.
Ortho:
1. Total knee replacement: The patient is status post right
total knee replacement on 8/19/06 .  Her right knee has a
well-healed incision and is not erythematous or tender. The
patient was initially on low-dose anticoagulation with Coumadin.
Her Coumadin was discontinued given her acute illness and her
need for procedures. She was treated with heparin subq
prophylactic doses 5000 units t.i.d. as described above. She
will need rehabilitation for her knee.
2. Prophylaxis: The patient was treated with subcutaneous
heparin and Nexium.
3. Access: The patient has peripheral IVs.
DISCHARGE STATUS:
On the day of discharge 3/8/06 , the patient was afebrile.
Heart rate was in the 80s , blood pressure was in the
100s-130s/60s-80s. Discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. The
patient was drowsy , but arouseable. She was breathing on a trach
collar. She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. She had
an S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal
border. Her abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel
sounds. Her trach and PEG site were intact without any
surrounding erythema. Her extremities were warm without edema.
She was on trach collar with 50% FiO2 and oxygen saturation of
97%. Her discharge labs included a white blood cell count of 21 ,
stable , hematocrit of 28 , and platelets 436 , 000. Her chem-7
included a sodium of 131 , potassium 3 , chloride 87 , CO2 32 , BUN
67 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 154. Her LFTs were normal. Her
INR was 1.1. Her most recent microdata showed sputum with few
polys and a few gram-positive cocci in clusters. Her chest x-ray
showed a trach in place and bilateral hazy infiltrate consistent
with resolving ARDS.
An addendum will be given with discharge medications and doses.
At rehab , the patient&apos;s weight should be monitored daily. Her
blood sugars initially be monitored every 2-3 hours. After that ,
her blood sugar monitoring can be spaced out to t.i.d. or
whenever deemed appropriate by the physician at the
rehabilitation facility. Her hematocrit should be checked
particularly if she has any bleeding from her tracheostomy site;
otherwise , the hematocrit can be checked every day. The white
blood cell count should be monitored if the patient has any
fever. The creatinine should be monitored daily in light of the
patient&apos;s changing diuretic regimen. The patient in&apos;s and out&apos;s
should be monitored closely.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Borge is a 64-year-old gentleman with a previous history of
myocardial infarction x4 who presented to the Emergency
Department on 3/10/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion over the previous two months. The patient has known
coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple PTCAs and
balloon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branch
of his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of his
posterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting of
his distal right coronary artery in 2005. While in the emergency
department , the patient had an episode of substernal chest
pressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. He
received sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. EKG
at that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-wave
inversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation in
leads II , III and aVF. On 1/5/06 , he underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed the following , posterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , right
coronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflex
coronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. Right
dominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensive
stenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. Distal right
coronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aortic
stenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60
mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,
moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,
and mild pulmonic insufficiency. Carotid ultrasound revealed
right internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , left
internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. Pulmonary
function tests revealed FVC of 3.11 , 53% , and an FEV1 of 1.66 ,
35% predicted. Chest CT also performed on 5/29/06 revealed
cardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valve
and coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodular
density measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the left
lung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleural
thickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded ,
recommending a repeat chest CT in six months after discharge , and
small ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas.
PAST MEDICAL AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction , class II angina with
slight limitation of ordinary activity , class III heart failure
with marked limitation of physical activity , status post a PTCA
atherectomy and stent placement , hypertension ,

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Kreidler was brought to the operating room on 8/13/06 where
he underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graft
x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery. Total bypass time was 164 minutes. Total
crossclamp time was 127 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was a
bicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,
moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiring
adhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. Transesophageal
echocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aortic
prosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittent
heart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and in stable condition. Please refer to dictation
number 4691426 for the immediate postoperative course. The
patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 7/26/06 .  The
patient&apos;s mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initially
was with sitters in the Step-Down Unit , and also was in a
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure ,
and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. The patient&apos;s mental
status improved , did well off sitters , and continue with
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Mr. Salser was placed on
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. Neurologically , he
remained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin
for H. flu and Staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive to
Bactrim , and started on a 5-day course of Bactrim twice a day.
He was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9.

ATTENDING: DELPINO , VANCE SAMMY MD
SERVICE:
The patient has been treated on Cardiac Surgery Service.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Feddes is a 56-year-old female with past medical history
significant for obesity and idiopathic cardiomyopathy diagnosed
in 1990 with an EF of 15% who was admitted on 7/20/05 for
one-week history of lower extremity edema and worsening heart
failure. She was treated initially on the Medicine Service where
she was aggressively diuresed but was requiring increasing
pressors and progressing in her CHF despite transfer to the CCU
and appropriate management by the medical team. On 1/10/05 , a
transplant heart became available , and she proceeded to undergo a
heart transplant.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Diabetes , renal failure , gout and obesity.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Tubal ligation , gastric stapling for obesity , and a Hickman
placement.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Lovenox 40 mg q. daily , Lasix 30 IV continuously , dobutamine 5 IV
cutaneously , milrinone 0.3 mcg/kg/ minute , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , sliding scale insulin , metolazone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
probenecid 500 mg p.o. daily , thiamine 50 mg p.o. daily ,
vancomycin 1 gram IV b.i.d. MVI therapeutic one tab p.o. daily ,
carnitine 0.5 grams p.o. t.i.d. , and Celexa 30 mg p.o. daily.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was initially treated on the Medicine Service but on
1/10/05 was taken to the operating room by the Cardiac Surgery
Service for a heart transplant. For detailed description of the
operative procedure , please see the dictated OP note. The
patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the Walklos Ey Trham Aupids Lubfranna ICU
in a critical condition.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Neurological: Initially , the patient was kept sedated on
propofol as well as intermittent fentanyl and Versed. As she was
weaned towards extubation , her sedating medications were weaned
and she was extubated while on Precedex due to her history of
anxiety. Her Precedex was eventually weaned off and she was
neurologically intact but frequently confused and often
disoriented. Over the next several days , has continued to wean
and she was restarted on her Celexa as well as Ativan for
agitation and anxiety. At the time of transfer , she is
neurologically intact with no focal neurological deficits and she
is no longer confused. She is awake , alert and oriented to
person , place and time and completely appropriate in her speech.
Cardiovascular: Shortly after her operation , she was felt to be
in profound right heart failure. She was started on milrinone
with successive treatment of her right heart failure. Over the
next several days , she was weaned off slowly her pressors and
underwent an echocardiogram which showed moderate-to-severe TR
and a large pericardial effusion with some indentation of the
right atrium with respiration. However , no pericardiocentesis
was performed as the patient was not clinically in tamponade.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization for right heart biopsy ,
the results of which are still pending. At the present time , she
is on diltiazem 15 mg p.o. q.8h. for hypertension as well as
milrinone 0.2. Cardiology is following and plans to keep the
milrinone going for the time being.
Pulmonary. The patient was kept intubated for the first several
days while she was unstable and on pressors. However , as she
began to improve , we weaned towards extubation , and she was
successfully extubated. At the current time , she is able to
ambulate on room air and has no pulmonary issues.
GI: The patient was kept n.p.o. for the first seven days after
her operation. After her extubation , a Dobbhoff feeding tube was
inserted and she was started on tube feeds until she was able to
clear her speech and swallow. Upon clearing her speech and
swallow evaluation , she was started on minced food with thickened
liquids , which she tolerated with minimal signs or symptoms of
aspiration. She was advanced to a house diet with thickened
liquids and is now taking that well and having normal bowel
movements. She is on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
GU: Initially , she was given a lot of fluid in order to wean her
pressors; however , she was diuresed aggressively after the first
two postoperative days for currently being on a Lasix drip or
receiving large bolus doses of Lasix. Her creatinine has trended
up minorly postoperatively to a current level of 1.8. She is no
longer receiving any diuretics and is just being managed by
keeping her I&apos;s and O&apos;s even. She is on no nephrotoxic
medications.
Heme: She is frequently anemic with her hematocrit often
trending downwards to levels as low as 20 or 21. She has been
transfused with multiple units of blood products and will be
transfused today one unit of packed red cells for a hematocrit of
21. She has been started on Niferex for iron therapy , and we are
considering the addition of erythropoietin. Otherwise , she is
stable and has no heme issues.
ID and Immunosuppression:
She has been immunosuppressed on various different medications.
Her current regimen is Cellcept 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral 125
mg p.o. b.i.d. , prednisone 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. For prophylaxis ,
she is also on Valcyte 450 mg p.o. daily , and Bactrim one double
strength tab q.o.d. as well as nystatin swish and swallow and
powders for her axilla and groin. She has not spiked any temps
and none of her cultures have been positive except for one
urinary culture positive for Gram-negative rods for which she is
on levofloxacin 250 daily for seven days.
Endocrine: Her sugars have been very difficult control. She was
initially on the Portland protocol for several days
postoperatively and on an insulin drip according to her sugar
levels. Diabetes Management Service was consulted and has been
assessing her daily for her insulin needs. She is currently on a
regimen that consist of 30 mg of Lantus every evening as well as
8 units of Novolog with every meal and sliding scale coverage
with Novolog for meals as well. Her sugars are mildly well
controlled but could use tighter glycemic control.

Discharge Date: 3/4/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
3. SCIATICA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , hypertension and chronic pain , admitted with chest pain.
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , increased cholesterol ,
positive family history and history of coronary artery disease. She
has a history of Q wave myocardial infarction with right
ventricular infarct in October 1992. Peak CK&apos;s were 2300.
Catheterization showed 100% RCA lesion which was treated with
angioplasty reduced to 20-30% stenosis. The patient had chest pain
the succeeding months and had two catheterizations showing no
change in her coronary arteries. Echocardiogram showed an LVEF of
50%. Subsequent catheterization October 92 , July 92 and September 92
for atypical chest pain , showed clean coronaries. Exercise tread
mill test in September 92 , the patient went three minutes and 31 seconds
with standard Bruce protocol and stopped secondary to atypical
chest pain. Maximum heart rate 162 , blood pressure 176/90 , no ST
or T wave changes. In April 92 she ruled out for myocardial
infarction by enzymes and EKG , after presenting with prolonged
chest pain. VQ scan was low probability. Chest CT ruled out aortic
dissection. The patient was referred to the Pain Service. In
February 1993 the patient had additional sharp chest pain , again
ruled out for myocardial infarction , was seen by the Pain Services
and discharged on trazodone and Relafen plus cardiac medicines.
The patient now presents to the hospital with 24 hours of right
sided chest pain , stating that it was squeezing in her right
breast , felt to be between the shoulder blades. She took two
sublingual Nitroglycerin the day before admission and three on the
morning of admission without relief. She complained of shortness of
breath , dizziness , weakness and nausea , no palpitations were noted.
The pain was not worse with positional changes. The patient is seen
in the Sonri Health emergency room where she received
two sublingual Nitroglycerins which reduced her pain from 7/10 to
1/10 level. She also received 10 mg IV Morphine , 725 mg IV
Lopressor , two inches Nitro Paste and two liters of oxygen. The
pain was intermittent through the rest of the day. She had no
fever , chills , cough , she did complain of urinary frequency ,
chronic left back pain and right lower extremity pain. ALLERGIES:
Penicillin , erythromycin and tetracycline which causes hives.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pulse 92 , blood pressure 148/100 ,
temperature 98.1 , she is an obese female in
no acute distress. Cardiac , regular rate and rhythm , SI , SII , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. The pain is not reproducible by
palpation. Extremities , 1+ edema of the lower extremities with
preserved peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Cholesterol 226. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm
of 90 beats per minute , normal intervals , left
ventricular hypertrophy. There were T wave inversions in Leads I ,
V2 , V6 , bisphasic T waves V5 , flat waves V3 , V4 , left atrial
enlargement. Compared with the examination of 2/7/93 T wave
inversions were less deep in V3 through V5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by
serial EKG and enzymes. Her blood pressure was
initially poorly controlled and she was placed on a regimen of
Aldomet 750 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lopressor 150 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
Nifedipine XL 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. On 11/28/93 the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronary arteries ,
mildly elevated pulmonary pressure of 40/24 and mean of 30 ,
capillary wedge pressure of 14 mm mercury. On the afternoon of
5/10 the patient had 600 mg of Levatol and two hours later
complained of light-headedness with a systolic blood pressure in
the 80&apos;s. This gradually increased to greater than 110 systolic so
the patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and received 400
cc&apos;s of IV fluids. She was also noted to have the onset of
wheezing. 02 sat was 95% on five liters of oxygen , chest x-ray
showed cardiac enlargement with regeneration of the pulmonary flow
suggestive of mild congestive heart failure. The patient received
albuterol nebs q 15 minutes x 4 with good response and was felt to
have had a bronchospastic reaction to beta blockers. She did well
for the rest of her hospitalization , had no further chest pain.
DISPOSITION: She was discharged in good condition to home with
instructions to followup with Dr. Kasten on Tuesday
May .  MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 1 p.o. q d;
Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.; trazodone 100 mg p.o. q h.s.; Elavil 25
mg p.o q h.s.; Procardia XL 90 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lopressor 100 mg

Discharge Date: 6/21/2003
Date of Discharge: 6/21/2003
ATTENDING: NOE DEMETRIUS MANDELLA MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Diverticulitis.
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Gout.
6. Hypertension.
7. High cholesterol.
8. Diabetes Mellitus.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old
female with a past medical history of significant obesity ,
diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , heart failure ,
pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2 who presented with shortness of
breath , and left jaw pain on 8/10/2003 .  She had been in her
usual state of health until approximately 6 p.m. on the day of
admission , when at that time , she suddenly became short of
breath. She reports that she then sat down in her wheelchair and
&quot;passed out.&quot; However , it is unclear if the patient actually
lost consciousness. The patient also developed jaw pain
radiating to her back while EMTs were present and also complained
of a tug in her chest. The pain was unrelieved by nitroglycerin ,
oxygen; it was constant in nature. At the time of her arrival in
the emergency room , the patient was hemodynamically stable with
an O2 sat of 99% on room air. She was given sublingual nitrate
with no effect. Because of her history of coronary artery
disease , she was tried on heparin and aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2.
2. Reported history of an anterolateral MI.
3. Diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. High cholesterol.
MEDICATIONS: On admission , insulin 70/30 22 units q.a.m. 26
units q.p.m. , atenolol 25 q.d. , Zocor 20 q.d. , Zoloft 50 q.d. ,
Lasix 60 p.o. b.i.d. , Neurontin 100 t.i.d. , aspirin , and
multivitamin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 97 , pulse
was 54-60 , blood pressure was 100-120/50-80 , and O2 sat was 98%
to 99% on 6 liters. She was a moderately obese woman in no acute
distress. Her lung are notable for crackles at the bases. Her
cardiac exam was notable for distant heart sounds with a normal
S1 , S2. She had no pedal edema in her extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for a BUN and
creatinine of 31 and 1.1. Normal LFTs The patient&apos;s hematocrit
was 38. Her D-dimer was 736.
Her EKG showed normal sinus at low voltages , poor R-wave
progression.
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was a
62-year-old female with morbid obesity and chronic episodes of
shortness of breath , this time accompanied by jaw pain and with a
history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factors
concerning for acute coronary syndrome. The patient was
initially treated for a possible ischemic event. Diagnosis of PE
results were considered. However , the patient was not
tachycardic. She did not have any chest pain or new O2
requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolism
during prior hospitalization with similar systems , so therefore ,
this was thought to be less likely.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system:
CARDIAC. In terms of ischemia , the patient had 3 tests of
cardiac enzymes , which returned negative. She was maintained on
telemetry , and she had EKG checked , which did not reveal any
changes. This was a patient who had a dobutamine MIBI , which was
negative for any evidence of ischemic changes. During the MIBI ,
there was no evidence of ischemia and/or scar. The patient was
continued on her outpatient medications including aspirin , Zocor ,
and atenolol. However , at a later point in her hospitalization ,
she became hypotensive at which time her atenolol was temporarily
DC&apos;d , but this was restarted prior to discharge. In terms of the
patient&apos;s cardiac function , she has a history of CHF and is on
Lasix as an outpatient. An echocardiogram was repeated during
this hospitalization , which was notable for an EF of 60% ,
trace-to-mild MR , moderate TR , and estimated pulmonary systolic
pressure at 70 mmHg. The patient was continued on outpatient
Lasix regimen until at a later point during this hospitalization ,
the patient became hypertensive with acute renal failure at which
time her Lasix was discontinued. Lasix was restarted prior to
discharge. In terms of the patient&apos;s rhythm , she had no evidence
of arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization.
GI. On 10/10/2003 , the patient developed acute onset of diarrhea
and lower abdominal pain. Now , this pain was nonradiating ,
alternating sharp and dull but constant , associated with nausea
and vomiting , and frequent stools. At times , the stools were
notable for bright red blood. The patient was therefore started
on levofloxacin and Flagyl as treatment for diverticulitis versus
ischemic colitis. To further evaluate this , a CT scan of the
abdomen was done , which was notable for a thickened colon for 10
cm at the hepatic flexure. Given this information , it was the GI
consult&apos;s opinion that this is most likely consistent with
diverticulitis , and the plan was to treat it aggressively with
antibiotics , and once the symptoms resolved , recommended a
colonoscopy several weeks after discharge. The patient was
continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl , but then , several days
later , became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the
80s. At this time , the patient&apos;s antibiotic coverage was changed
to include Ceptaz and vancomycin , and she also received 1 dose of
gentamicin. By the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s abdominal
symptoms have completely resolved. She is no longer having any
abdominal pain , and she needs no longer having any diarrhea and
is tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. The plan
is for her to have a followup colonoscopy as an outpatient.
PULMONARY: The patient was admitted for shortness of breath. A
differential diagnosis at that time included chronic pulmonary
embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the
setting of a chronic pulmonary fibrosis. To establish that the
patient did not have any PE , she had lower extremity Doppler
exams , which were negative. She also had a PT protocol CT , which
was negative for any evidence of clots. Because the patient does
have cardiopulmonary hypertension , she was started on Coumadin as
prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in
her pulmonary vasculature. Throughout this hospitalization , she
was continued on her own home regimen of O2.
RENAL: The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with
a baseline creatinine at 1.4 during this hospitalization at a
time that her diarrhea was very severe , and when her blood
pressures fell in the 80s , the patient developed acute renal
failure with a peak creatinine of 2.4 with decreased urine
output. The thought of the team was that this represented a
renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea , fluid losses , and
hypertension. Her pheno was consistent with this at 0.71. She
was treated with aggressive IV fluids. She also had a renal
ultrasound , which was normal. She did have 1 day of hematuria ,
which was thought to be due most likely to Foley trauma , which
resolved at the time of discharge.
ID: The patient&apos;s hospital course was notable for a diarrhea as
mentioned in GI. She was initially treated with levofloxacin and
Flagyl and then when she became hypertensive was then change her
Flagyl , Ceptaz , and vancomycin with 1 dose of gentamicin. Her
symptoms dramatically improved on these antibiotics on 9/18 she
was changed from IV antibiotics to a p.o. regimen of Flagyl and
levofloxacin. The plan is for her to continue a total of 14 days
of antibiotics. I anticipate the last day of antibiotic coverage
will be 2/19/2003 .
RHEUMATOLOGY: On 10/27/2003 , the patient was noted to have left
knee pain and was noted to have some focal lateral patellar
tenderness and swelling. A knee aspirate was performed and urate
crystals were identified , and the patient was diagnosed with
gout. Because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea ,
the decision was made to treat her gout flare with steroids , and
she is currently is on a steroid taper as treatment.
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes. She takes
70/30 insulin at home. She was initially continued on an
outpatient regimen; however , when she started to begin having
massive diarrhea , she was taken off her long-acting insulin ,
because she was not taking anything by p.o. At this time , she
was not tolerating a regular diet , and her insulin requirements
were increasing. It is recommended that as an outpatient , she
resumes one-half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for 1 or
2 days to ensure that her insulin requirements in her diet are
appropriate , and then , she should resume her regular insulin
dosage.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
prednisone taper - which involves 10 mg of prednisone on 8/14
followed by 5 mg of prednisone on 10/27 , 1/24 , and 3/1 and
then stop , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin 70/30 11 units
q.a.m. 13 units q.p.m. - once it is established that the patient
has returned to her regular diet , this dosage should be doubled
to her outpatient regular dose , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient has been discharged to a rehab
facility.
FOLLOWUP: The patient is to follow up with her primary care
physician , Dr. Hargus following discharge.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Antibiotics should be continued until
2/19/2003 .  The patient should have her INR checked in 3 days.
Her goal INR is 2. Once off levofloxacin , her dose of Coumadin
may need to be adjusted.
2. The patient should have an outpatient colonoscopy and treated
for a week to further assess for diverticulitis.
3. Fingerstick blood glucoses should be followed regularly as
the patient&apos;s insulin dose is titrated up to her previous
outpatient dose.

Discharge Date: 2/19/2006
ATTENDING: MCLATCHY , CHRIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Allaway is a 52-year-old gentleman
who was initially admitted to Dutchesscanscot Medical Center due to nausea ,
myalgias and weakness. The patient has a history of type I
diabetes mellitus , end-stage renal disease with
subsequent renal transplant 11 years ago donated by his sister
for which he takes cyclosporine and azathioprine. The patient
had a neuropathic left plantar ulcer seven years ago for which he
underwent transmetatarsal amputation of his left foot at Reus Ortston University Of Medical Center .
He has had a chronic recurrent ulcer of the left foot
over the last two years or so. The patient nonetheless was
reasonably doing well and very active. He recently did a 35-mile
bike ride in about four or five days prior to admission. He
developed nausea and vomiting which lasted for one day. He then
developed weakness and hyperglycemia. He tried to increase his
insulin , but found he did not have an adequate response. The
patient became more weak and was brought to the Copot Memorial Health Centers Emergency Department where he was found to have moderate
diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration. The patient&apos;s workup also
suggested acute myocardial infarction and was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit. Echocardiogram was performed which revealed
an ejection fraction of 30% with dyskinesis of the inferior and
apical walls , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mild left
atrial enlargement and intact interatrial septum , mild mitral
regurgitation , left atrium with history of thrombus ,
inferobasilar and inferoseptal akinesis consistent with old
inferoposterior myocardial infarction , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , trileaflet aortic valve , which is quite mobile
with no evidence for significant aortic insufficiency , normal
pulmonic valve and aortic atherosclerosis. No pericardial
effusion and no evidence of endocarditis. The patient developed
a fever the day of admission and blood cultures were drawn which
grew out Streptococcus morbillorum and Bacteroides. His foot
became clearly boggy and grossly infected with necrosis.
Within an hour of that he underwent guillotine amputation of his
left foot. His temperature normalized and his foot cultures grew
out Streptococcus mutans and E. coli as well as Bacteroides
fragilis. He received ampicillin and sulbactam for bacteremia on
11/2/06 .  He underwent a coronary cardiac catheterization and
was found to have the following , left main coronary artery with
an ostial 100% stenosis. Formal report is not available at this
time. The patient was then transferred to Johni Hospital for coronary artery bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction ,
history of class II heart failure , hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , diabetic vasculopathy , renal failure and
nephropathy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for left transmetatarsal
amputation , recent left guillotine amputation of left foot and
renal transplant 11 years ago.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Kincer was brought to the operating room on
2/1/06 where he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass
graft x4 with a sequential graft from the saphenous vein graft
from aorta to the ramus and then the second obtuse marginal
coronary artery and left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending coronary artery and a saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery. Total bypass time was 121
minutes. Total crossclamp time was 104 minutes. The patient did
well intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident and was
brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in
stable condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. He was
extubated and transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #1. Infectious Disease Service was called and recommended
treating the patient with levofloxacin and Flagyl for total of 14
days for his left leg BKA site. The patient&apos;s chest tubes were
removed and post-pull chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.
Dr. Chang Eichberger from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted and
the patient was scheduled for revision of his left BKA on
11/9/06 .  Mr. Strathman was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus
Service postoperatively for his insulin regimen. He also
experienced some postoperative urinary retention with several
failed voiding trials. The patient will be discharged with a leg
bag and will follow up with a urologist within five to seven days who will be
assigned by his primary care physician. The
patient had already been started on Flomax 0.4 mg daily. The
patient also worked with physical therapy and is able to pivot
with assist and will be discharged to home with physical therapy. Mr. Farrelly was
cleared for discharge to home with visiting nurse and PT on postoperative day
#11. Mr. Berne also had postoperative anemia and was transfused with one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22 with a repeat at time
of discharge to 23.4. He also required further diuresis and
appears to be hemodiluted. The patient was also instructed on
sternal precautions due to his left BKA and patient and the
family were shown sternal precautions.

ALLERGY/ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS:
1. Sulfa , the allergic reaction is unclear , although it has
noted anaphylaxis on previous discharge summaries.
2. Theophylline causes tongue swelling.
3. Quinine reaction unclear.
4. Iodine/IV contrast. This is noted in the medical record.
However , the patient does not remember having an adverse reaction
or allergic reaction to IV contrast.
5. Iron , this reaction is unknown.
6. Erythromycin , again , the patient does not remember any
reaction , but apparently has hives.
7. Levofloxacin , unclear what the reaction is. She has
tolerated this in April , which she was treated for a foot
ulcer. It is not clear if this is a rash or it was thought to be
possibly related to a fever that the patient had , but it is not
clear what the actual reaction is.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is an 80-pack-year smoker. He is currently smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
Her temperature was 99 , her pulse was 98 , her blood pressure was
105/55. Her respiratory rate was 18 when she was saturating 94%
on room air. In general , she is in no acute distress. Her HEENT
exam was unremarkable. Her cardiac exam was regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her lung exam was
notable for crackles most prominent in the left lower lobe. Her
abdomen was soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with good
bowel sounds. Her extremities were significant for erythema of
the left shin without warmth or tenderness. She also had a small
1.5 cm ulceration on the bottom of her left foot which has been
present for sometime although she says that it looks better than
at first. There was no purulence or purulent drainage from the
wound. Her neurologic exam was unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Her labs were notable for a creatinine of 1.6 , a white count of
4.1 , with 11% eosinophils. Her hematocrit was 31.6 , and her
albumin was 3.
PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization: it was done by Dr. Eeds .
FINDINGS:
Showed a right dominant circulation. There were no significant
left main lesions identified. The LAD had a tubular 90% lesion
and the diagonal I had a proximal tubular 60% lesion , there was
also a diffuse 80% lesion of the proximal circumflex. The RCA
had a proximal 75% lesion with a mid diffuse 60% lesion and a PLV
tubular 70% lesion. The coronary artery bypass grafts had a
patent LIMA to LAD graft , the SVG to marginal I had a 100% lesion
during this catheterization due to the moderate amount of
contrast and the patient&apos;s chronic kidney disease , they treated
the RCA and placed a 3 x 24 mm Taxus stent
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
On 7/9/07 , showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% with
inferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis. The RV was normal.
There was mild aortic stenosis. Mild-to-moderate aortic
regurgitation. The valve area was 1.2 cm2. There was mild
mitral regurgitation. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation
with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 mm plus right
atrial pressure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient was admitted because they had deep T
wave inversions in the lateral leads and are still concerning for
anginal equivalence of nausea and vomiting. It was decided on
admission that an echocardiogram would be performed and if there
was evidence of any regional wall motion abnormalities that she
would be taken directly to cath. The echocardiogram as noted
above showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery
disease. She was taken to the cath lab on 9/5/07 and they show
two ____ that one of the bypass grafts was completely occluded
and was not visualized. They also saw that there was a proximal
RCA lesion 60% which was found to account for the inferior
hypokinesis given the right arm circulation. This was stented
with a Taxus stent. Because of her kidney insufficiency , it was
decided not to pursue the 80% left circ lesion and this was
deferred until later point as this was not thought to be causing
any problems. Her post cath ECG was unchanged and continued to
have the deep lateral T wave inversions. She did not complain of
any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission. She
was started on aspirin and Plavix initially although as noted
below she did have an apparent allergy to Plavix and thus was
switched to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. instead of Plavix for
anticoagulation. She was also continued Lipitor 80 mg daily ,
Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. After her cath , it was originally planned
that she would go back to cath for intervention on the left
circulation lesion , however , given her other medical problems and
her relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically , it
was decided that they would wait and decide later if this lesion
needed to be corrected in the future or not.
b. Pump: The patient had no significant issues with her blood
pressure here. She remained in a blood pressure range of 100-120
throughout her stay. She was continued on her beta blocker as
noted above. However , at discharge , this was switched back to
atenolol as her home medications and she refused to change
medications , she said that she would not be able to afford new
prescription. We did increase her dose of atenolol to 25 mg
b.i.d. from 25 mg daily as her requirement of beta blockade
seemed to be higher than what her home dose was. Given that she
has a concurrent renal disease , it would probably be useful for
her to be on an ace inhibitor ARB as well. This medication
should be added as an outpatient , if her blood pressure tolerates
it. It was on the lower side here , so we did not add it. We did
not diurese her in fact we held her Lasix on admission because
she seemed to be volume depleted given that she was admitted with
a lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsidered if she
had increased edema. This can be restarted.
C: Rhythm: The patient was kept on telemetry , however , there
were no significant episodes of arrhythmias during her admission.
2. GI: The patient was admitted with persistent nausea and
diarrhea from Tlmamuthes Medical Center .  The diarrhea resolved one day
after admission. Her fecal leukocytes were positive but her C.
diff was negative. It was unclear what the etiology of this
diarrhea was and we were going to send a repeat stool study ,
however , she did not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be
antibiotics associated diarrhea but it seemed to resolve
spontaneously.
3. Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with crackles in the
left lower lobe and some wheezing consistent with COPD and
pneumonia. A chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobe
infiltrate/atelectasis. We initially continued her on Augmentin ,
which she was taking for her diabetic foot ulcer. However , she
did not appear to clinically respond to this medication. We held
her antibiotics as noted below in the ID section and after that
her white blood cell count increased and she produced some
purulent sputum and Gram-negative rods. The Gram-negative rods
were later speciated as serratia although this information is not
available at the time of her discharge. She was treated for a
hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime to
complete a 14-day course. Clinically , she appeared to improve on
this regimen , although her white count was still elevated at 15
on discharge , however , given her overall clinical stability , the
lack of fevers and the lack of systemic symptoms. We felt
comfortable with discharging her with close follow up.
4. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted on
Augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the notes from Grantnas Healthcare by the Infectious Disease Service recommended a 2-4 week
course of Augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer. She had
completed three weeks of therapy and thus we discontinued this
medication as it did not seem that there was really any evidence
of active infection in her foot. After holding the antibiotics
for three days , her white count began to rise and she developed a
purulent cough as noted above , this was thought to be a
hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with vancomycin and
ceftazidime and she will complete a 14-day course of these
antibiotics.
5. Endocrine: The patient was home on oral hypoglycemics. She
was switched to coverage with an insulin scale. Her sugars were
relatively well controlled and she did not require much in the
way of supplemental insulin.
6. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease. Her baseline
creatinine was 1.5-1.6. She was admitted and had a cath. She
was given Mucomyst and bicarbonated fluids for renal protection
during her dilute. Because of the risk for kidneys , the cath was
done with a little amount of dye as possible. Her creatinine
remained stable throughout her admission and settled out at 1.6
of her creatinine which is the baseline.
ALLERGY:
During the patient&apos;s admission , it was noted that she developed a
rash on 4/15/06 .  She was seen by the Allergy and Immunology
Service at the request of the cath lab given that there was
concern that she had this rash because of her Plavix. They felt
that this was possible. This was the most likely etiology and in
conjunction with her high eosinophil count it was felt that this
was a drug reaction to the Plavix. She was switched to
ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. and her rash appeared to improve. She
was also given claritin as well as put on a brief prednisone
taper given her diffuse rash and her brisk eosinophilia. She
should follow up with Allergy and Immunology in about one month
to see if the rash has resolved and potentially to try
rechallenge with Plavix at that point.
Cellulitis/diabetic foot ulcer: The patient has had a
longstanding diabetic foot ulcer which has been treated by wound
care VNA and was treated at Tha Hospital .  We continued the
Augmentin to a total course of three weeks and then stopped it.
We continued her dressing changes and this will be followed by
the VNA at home. There was no evidence of active infection ,
there was no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcer
and the erythema around the foot appeared to be stable , this was
most likely chronic venous stasis change and not a true
cellulitis as there was no warmth or tenderness in this region.
CONSULTANTS:
Allergy/Immunology , the attending was Dr. Frija .
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 86 , her blood pressure
was 120/60 , her respiratory rate was 20. She was 92-96% on room
air. In general , she was in no acute distress. Her JVP was
about 7 cm. She had small amount of crackles at bilateral bases.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and
S2. There was a 2/6 systolic murmur most prominent at the left
lower sternal border. Her abdomen is soft , nontender , and
nondistended with good bowel sounds. She had 1+ edema
bilaterally with small amounts of erythema at the distal end of
the left lower extremity which has been stable. There is no
associated warmth or tenderness. She did have a 1.5 cm small
ulcer on the ventral aspect of her left foot , which did not have
any purulence associated with it. Her neurologic exam was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Notable for a creatinine of 1.5 , a white blood cell count of
15.89 , with 82.7% neutrophils , 3.8% eosinophils. Her hematocrit
was 28.6. Her baseline appears to be around 30.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ticlopidine 250 mg by mouth twice a day.
2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 80 mg daily.
4. Prednisone taper 30 mg on 10/18/07 , 20 mg on 10/3/07 , 10 mg
on 10/18/07 and then stop.
5. Vancomycin 1 g IV daily , course to be completed on 1/16/07 .
6. Ceftazidime 1 g daily to be complete on 1/16/07 .
7. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
8. Neurontin 300 mg three times a day.
9. Tessalon perles as needed.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.
11. Glipizide 2.5 mg daily.
12. DuoNeb every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath.
13. Lasix 30 mg by mouth daily.
14. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
DISPOSITION:
Home with services.
PENDING TESTS:
As noted , the patient had a sputum culture that was growing
Gram-negative rods at the time of discharge. The current report
is that it was growing Serratia marcescens which should be staph
sensitive to ceftazidime , which he was prescribed for a total of
14 days.
FOLLOW UP:
She will follow up with Dr. Antony Baldonado on 10/12/07 at 9:30
a.m. She has an appointment scheduled.
TO DO LIST:
1. The patient has an 80% left circumflex lesion which was not
stented. This should be , ___28.20__ , whether she needs a second
intervention in the future. She does appear to be asymptomatic ,
but she does continue to have the deep lateral T wave inversion
suggesting the areas of abnormal blood flow in the heart. It was
thought that the right RCA lesion was more likely to be the cause
of her inferior wall hypokinesis , so that was the procedure
performed.
2. The patient was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with
vancomycin and ceftazidime. This will continue until 1/16/07 .
She was noted to have a rash here which was thought to be Plavix
related. If the rash resolves on ticlopidine , she may need to
readdress whether or not this was actually due to Plavix. It was
recommended that she follow up with an allergist in about a month
from her hospitalization who can review the records and determine
whether she should start Plavix or maintain on the ticlopidine.
3. Her platelets should be monitored given that she started on
ticlopidine and there is a risk of TTP associated with this
medication.

Discharge Date: 2/12/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: CHIEF COMPLAINT was a 57 year old man
who was status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty times 2 , of a left anterior
descending stenosis for unstable angina , and was admitted for new
onset of angina at rest. The patient&apos;s cardiac risk factors
included family history , borderline high cholesterol. The patient
had no prior cardiac history , until 12 of June , when he had substernal
chest pain with exertion. He eventually had cardiac
catheterization which showed an 80% proximal left anterior
descending lesion with thrombosis , good left ventricular function.
The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to
this lesion. He was without symptoms for about 4 weeks , and then
in 23 of August , the patient noted new onset chest pain and left arm
numbness at rest. An electrocardiogram at that time showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 , T-wave inversions in II with flat T-waves in
III , and was otherwise unremarkable. He had an exercise tolerance
test at the time and went on a 9-minute standard Bruce protocol and
stopped secondary to fatigue. The electrocardiogram showed 3 to 4
millimeter ST depressions in the lateral leads , which was highly
predictive of coronary artery disease. At that time , he was repeat
cardiac catheterization which showed a restenosis of his left
anterior descending lesion. He had a repeat percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion without
complications. The patient did well for several weeks and was
pain-free. However , 6 days prior to admission , the patient began
to note occasional episodes of left arm numbness , which was always
relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. There was no accompanying
dizziness , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. The patient at first had
2 or 3 episodes a day , now increased to 7 or 8 times a day at the
time of admission. On the day of adimssion , the patient had almost
constant chest pain and arm pain which lasted almost all day , only
partially relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient was
very concerned about the pain , and now comes to Tes Healthcare for further evaluation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included
arthritis , kidney stones , chronic lower back pain. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION were Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
aspirin 325 milligrams by mouth per day , Isordil 10 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day. ALLERGIES included no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient was a retired firefighter ,
occasional red wine , no tobacco use. His brother had 3 myocardial
infarctions in the past , no other FAMILY HISTORY.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , pulse 54 , blood
pressure 104/70 , respirations 20. There was
no jugular venous distention. Chest was clear. Cardiac
examination showed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no
peripheral edema. Extremities had good pulses bilaterally in
dorsalis pedis , posterior tibial and femoral.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admitting laboratory values were
remarkable for potassium 4.3 , creatinine
1.0 , hematocrit 40.8. The electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 , normal intervals , flat T-waves in AVF , V2 and
V3 , QRS axis 0 degrees. Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or
effusions , no evidence of congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. He had no elevations in his
serum creatinine kinase levels. The patient continued to have
intermittent left arm numbness during his hospital stay. For this
reason , he was taken back for cardiac catheterization , which showed
a 75% proximal left anterior descending lesion believed to be at
the same site as his previous percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty procedures. The patient had successful percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion with a 25% residual
stenosis. The patient postoperatively had no further episodes of
chest pain or arm numbness. He had no complications related to the
cardiac catheterization itself. The patient was then discharged.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE will be Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , diltiazem 60
milligrams by mouth twice a day. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP with
his cardiologist in 1 week.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft , ischemic
cardiomyopathy , valvular heart disease , known EF of 15-20% as of
9/19 , was admitted to the Rose-le Medical Center from
No Memorial with signs and symptoms of
decompensated heart failure , and acute on chronic renal failure.
On 8/7/06 , he was admitted with a large left foot toe ulcer
that was nonhealing. Multiple surgeries were performed with
persistent nonhealing wounds: Left great toe amputation on
2/18/06 , which failed to heal despite SFA to perineal artery
bypassing the composite vein. Had a short CICU stay for
hypotension postoperatively , maintained on dobutamine. On
7/25/06 underwent debridement of left medial ulcer. On 10/7/06
transmetatarsal amputation , on 11/22/06 , debridement of
transmetatarsal amputation. On 9/22/06 received a left below
the knee amputation. His renal function had been normal prior to
the final surgery until 5/29/06 to 8/13/06 when his creatinine
rose from 1.3 to 2.2. He was discharged to acute rehabilitation
and was there noted to have this acute renal failure , which was
thought to be due to prerenal azotemia , but his creatinine at
this point had not changed much from 2.2 to 2.5 during his stay.
Diuretics were held at rehabilitation facility until two days
prior to admission. He was noted to have increased shortness of
breath. Patient denies any other symptoms up to that point
except occasional lightheadedness , depressed mood , and lack of
motivation. No orthopnea , uses 1 pillow regularly , denies
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and denies dyspnea on exertion , but
very limited movement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , GERD , hypercholesterolemia , CAD
status post MI in 1996 , received a CABG in 5/12 with a LIMA to
LAD , SVG to PDA , SVG to OM1 , and mitral valve annuloplasty.
Diabetes mellitus , insulin-dependent , status post bilateral below
the knee amputation , likely from diabetes related foot ulcers ,
history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter , history of
sick sinus syndrome , history of second-degree heart block , AICD
placed 10/27 complicated by hematoma. History of admissions for
hyponatremia. Status post left SFA to perineal artery bypass to
incompetent pain in 10/14 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily. Atrovent one to two puffs inhaled
q.i.d. p.r.n. for wheezing , Celexa 20 mg p.o. daily , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. daily , Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily , enteric-coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 25 units every day subcutaneous , Lasix
160 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Lopressor 50 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , therapeutic multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily ,
solsite topical.
IMPRESSION:
On admission , a 73-year-old male with severe cardiomyopathy and
ejection fraction of 15% admitted for decompensated heart failure
in the setting of his diuretics being held due to an acute renal
failure. Review of chart at the time of admission showed renal
failure is actually present since the perioperative period of his
BKA. After being admitted to the cardiology service , he was
diuresed successfully to his dry weight , with a significant
improvement in his oxygen saturation , his creatinine , and venous
congestion.
Other active issues he was treated for include urinary tract
infection , diabetes mellitus , acute on chronic renal failure ,
depression.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Known coronary artery disease
status post CABG x3 , admitted with troponin elevation likely due
to demand in the setting of heart failure for having his
diuretics held. This was noted to trend down post-diuresis. We
continued aspirin. Initially , we held his ACE inhibitor given
history of cough and his ARF , and ultimately restarted the
patient on ARB , after his creatinine had normalized. Statins had
been held until we were certain his liver function tests were
decreasing.
2. Cardiovascular pump: The patient remained in floor volume
overload on presentation , maintained on 2 grams salt daily , 2
liters fluid restriction diet with 1-2 liters per day goal
diuresis attained by using 100 mg IV torsemide b.i.d. with the
addition of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d. 30 minutes prior
to each torsemide dose , an average of two liter fluid negative.
Diuresis was affected over the course of a week , and his status
gradually improved. Spironolactone was initially held due to
high K but was re-added on 7/20/06 .  His jugular venous
distention dropped from initial presentation above the earlobes
at a 30-degree angle to a JVP of 6-7 cm at 30 degree angle on the
day of discharge. Two days prior to discharge , his creatinine
began to rise , suggesting prerenal azotemia secondary to over
diuresis and when his torsemide was reduced to 100 mg p.o. daily ,
hydrochlorothiazide was dropped from his regimen , patient&apos;s
creatinine began to drop again , and patient was able to maintain
even Ins and Outs of fluid for two days prior to discharge.
3. Cardiovascular rhythm: Patient is ventricularly paced on
symmetry for duration of hospitalization , history of atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin , was maintained on amiodarone during
this hospitalization.
4. Pulmonary: The patient with initial O2 dependence.
Continued inhaled ipratropium his home medication. After
diuresis , the patient was able to achieve oxygen saturation of
100% on room air.
5. Renal: Initial acute on chronic renal failure thought
secondary to volume overload and forward flow in the context of
decompensated congestive heart failure. His renal function
improved , as he was diuresed and his heart likely moved to more
useful part of the starling curve. Renal ultrasound was negative
for hydronephrosis as was test for urine eosinophils.
Hyponatremia was likely due to heart failure improved with
diuresis.
6. Heme: The patient maintained on Coumadin with an INR goal of
2-3. In order to achieve this goal , his Coumadin dose was
adjusted to mg p.o. every other day. He will be followed by
chemo and Coumadin service after discharge with weekly tests to
make sure that his INR is maintained within this range.
7. Endocrine. Diabetes mellitus , insulin-dependent , covered on
NPH q.a.m. and q.p.m. with aspartate sliding scale for duration
of hospitalization.
8. Psych: The patient was restarted on Celexa per PCP for
likely depressive mood response to recent bilateral knee
amputation. It is what is quite possible that patient&apos;s
depression precedes the bilateral knee amputation and informs
much of his overall care. The patient&apos;s PCP , Dr. Micheal L Davirro , aware of the situation and managing as outpatient. The
patient was also seen by the inpatient psychiatry consultation ,
and started on Remeron 7.5 mg p.o. daily in place of Celexa. He
is discharged on this medication. The patient is status post one
fall from the bed during the hospitalization. Head CT at that
time showed no evidence of bleed or trauma to the head to head.
Examination of back and extremities reveals no focal tenderness
or ecchymoses.
9. Infectious disease. The patient initially treated for
urinary tract infection with uncomplicated course with
ciprofloxacin.
10. Wound: Wound care nurse consulted for BKA wound and small
decubitus on his back , was treated with DuoDERM , BKA site healing
well.
11. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient remained on
cardiac , 2000 calorie diabetic diet , however , as it became
apparent that he was severely malnourished , his diet was
liberalized to allow for nutritional supplementation.
12. PPX: The patient maintained on subcutaneous heparin and
Nexium as DVT and GI prophylaxis during this hospitalization.
13. Code status , full code.
TO DO PLAN
1. Discharge the patient to rehab on current regimen. Patient
has been working with PT and OT during this hospitalization and
appears well positioned to take advantage of rehabilitation
facilities services.
2. Maintain new prescription of Remeron , follow up with
psychiatry to assess depressive disorder/adjustment disorder.
3. The patient has been off beta-blocker. PCP may choose to
start beta-blocker at a low-dose in the outpatient setting.
4. Fasciculations noted during hospitalization fine
fasciculations at hands in Surga Hospital .  Maybe secondary to
malnutrition and diaries is , but may merit further workup in an
outpatient context.
5. The patient had rising alkaline phosphatase during
hospitalization , CT of chest incidentally showed gallstone
present within the gallbladder , follow up LFTs in the outpatient
context and possible right upper quadrant ultrasound may merit
consideration and further outpatient workup of this patient. The
patient will follow up with Coumadin clinic given goal INR of
2.0-3.0. The patient&apos;s creatinine and BUN should be checked
along with electrolytes to make sure patient is doing well on
current maintenance diuretic schedule of 100 mg torsemide p.o.
daily and spironolactone.
CODE STATUS:
Full code.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Stable. Discharged to rehabilitation.

ADDENDUM
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Neuro: Starting on 6/13/06 the patient had an episode of
agitation on hemodialysis where he received Ativan and continued
to be agitated and required multiple code greys to sedate him. A
team meeting was held on 8/13/06 and per psychiatry
recommendations the patient was started on 250 mg b.i.d. of
Depakote , Haldol was reduced to just Monday-Wednesday-Friday 1 mg
before hemodialysis and 1 mg p.r.n. agitation. The patient did
very well on this regimen and his Depakote level was stable at
39.7 on discharge. The plan is to continue Depakote b.i.d. 250
mg with Haldol p.r.n. for behavior. In terms of his mental
status on discharge , the patient was A&amp;O x3 and appropriate.
In terms of cardiac , there were no additional events to report.
In terms of pulmonary , the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia
on 10/26/06 and started on ceftriaxone IV and Flagyl. This was
changed to cefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. In terms of his
pneumonia that was evident right lower lobe pneumonia on chest
x-ray and the patient was also spiking fevers and had audible
rales on exam.
In terms of GI , the patient continued tolerate regular diet and
nutrition continued to follow ensuring adequate p.o. intake and
adjusting diet per endocrine needs.
In terms of endocrine , the addendum to 6/13/06 , the patient
ultimately discontinued on a regimen of 7 units of Lantus q.a.m.
and q.p.m. with 5 units aspart q.a.c. breakfast and lunch and 4
units of aspart q.a.c. dinner. His sliding scale was very light
and he is only to be covered with one to two units of aspart
during the night as insulin stacks in this patient very easily.
It was recommended if the patient is noted to be in the low 100s
consistently through the course of the day that his next dose of
aspart be either halved or held as the patient easily becomes
hypoglycemic and is unable to recognize the symptoms of
hypoglycemia himself. At the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s
fingersticks were well controlled in the 100-200 range.
In terms of ID , the patient began to spike fevers on 9/22/06
with a T. max of 100.6 and blood cultures failed to show anything
as did sputum cultures. On 5/18/06 , the patient spiked to 101.2
and had evidence of pneumonia on his chest x-ray. He was started
on antibiotics of ceftriaxone and Flagyl , which was switched to
cefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. The cefpodoxime should be
dosed after dialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday.
In terms of disposition , the patient has been discharged to rehab
where he will continue hemodialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday
and continues to have the same medication Rx as he did well in
house. Specific care should be given to his insulin regimen as
well as his behavior control and nutrition as noted in the
discharge instructions. Again please c.c. Dr. Donte Tasker , Dr.
Byron Hague , Dr. Bolin on this discharge summary.

Trace guaiac positive in ED. Hospital course as follows:
1. HEME -- Pt was tx&apos;d 2 U PRBC in ED c Hct response to 25.
Reticulocyte count was 1.1 and iron studies , B12 , folate prior to
transfusion were within nl limits. A chest CT was obtained re: her
thoracic aneurysm , which showed a chronic dissection , aneurysmal
diameter of 6 cm , but no change from previous. Hemolysis labs were
negative. Pt was transfused an add&apos;l 2 U PRBC on floor and responded
appropriately. Given her low retic count , there was suspicion she
could have a primary hematologic dz , and she is to follow up with Dr.
Walleck in clinic at RWHC next week.
2. CARD -- Pt had some DOE , which was thought to be related to
her anemia. She had negative cardiac enzymes in ED. EKG s changes ,
isolated TwI in III. She was maintained on her usual outpt regimen.
3. GI -- There was a consideration of a possible GI source , given
pt&apos;s history. GI was consulted and she received EGD/colonoscopy ,
which revealed extensive diverticulosis , but no evidence of bleeding.
Pt is being discharged to home to follow-up with Hematology and with
her primary care physician.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was admitted to Thickua Medical Center surgery service on
3/28/2007 for preoperative evaluation/clearance. On 4/14 she was
taken to the operating room where she underwent debridement of her
non-healing left TMA site No concerning intraoperative events occurred;
please see dictated operative note for details. In the PACU she was
noted to be oozing from several points within the wound bed. Two silk
stitches were placed with improved hemostasis. On POD 1 , the oozing
continued and her hct had dropped to 21. She remained hemodynamically
stable but given her cardiovascular history she was transfused a total of
4 units of blood over the next 2 hospital days. Surgicell was also placed
into the wound bed with adequate hemostasis. The remainder of her
hospital course was unremarkable. Patient had adequate pain control and
was tolerating sips on POD0 and was advanced to regular diet by POD1.
She remained neurologically intact postoperatively. Her blood pressure
remained at baseline ( SBP 110-140s ). She was kept on perioperative
Vanc/Levo/Flagyl throughout her hospitalization. On POD 4 , she was
discharged to rehab in stable condition , afebrile , voiding independently ,
with adequate pain control. Her wound had areas of granulation; will
plan to continue wet-to-dry dressings with normal saline for gentle
debridement. Will reevaluate for VAC dressing and possible eventual skin
graft closure on follow up. She was given explicit instructions to
follow-up in clinic with Dr. Foderaro in 1 week.

ATTENDING: REILL , LAZARO MD
GILM COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease , chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin , pulmonary
hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism
who presented in 5/25 with an apparent perforated appendicitis
for which she was taken to the operating room. Final pathology
during this procedure was serositis. Her postoperative course
was complicated by severe delirium , atrial fibrillation ,
abdominal abscesses requiring IR drainage in 10/10 and 10/7 .
The patient began having recurrent UTI , decreased appetite and
hematochezia at this time. On 8/17/05 , a CT of the abdomen
showed evidence of a colovesical fistula and the patient was
admitted to the Ore Of for further management.
On admission , she was found to be in acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 2.3 apparently secondary to dehydration after
recently having been started on Lasix for hypertension by her
primary care physician.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Asthma.
6. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
7. Hypothyroidism.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Appendectomy in 5/25 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Atrovent b.i.d.
2. Metaxalone 2.5 mg daily.
3. Lipitor 10 mg daily.
4. Lasix 60 mg daily.
5. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
6. Diltiazem 120 mg daily.
7. Potassium chloride 10 mg b.i.d.
8. Colace 100 mg t.i.d.
9. Folate.
10. Re1glan p.r.n.
11. Lisinopril 20 mg daily.
12. Wellbutrin 100 mg daily.
13. Protonix 40 mg daily.
14. Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Anorwin Hospital .  Her creatinine
improved with IV hydration on 3/25/05 .  She was taken to the
operating room for exploratory laparotomy , cystoscopy with
bilateral urinary stent placement , sigmoid colectomy with primary
anastomosis and diverting ileostomy. During the surgery , she
became hypotensive requiring pressors due to inability to replace
IV fluid adequately. She was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit , intubated on pressors. For the first
several days , she had a inflammatory response-type picture with
significant vasodilation requiring pressors and massive IV
resuscitation greater than 30 liters of fluid. Sedation was
slowly weaned as the patient&apos;s respiratory status improved. Due
to a question of responsiveness during the first several days , a
head CT was performed which showed no evidence of stroke. She
became slowly more responsive as sedation was weaned with the use
of Precedex and was extubated on 1/22/05 , postoperative day 7
without complications. Her mental status in the intensive care
unit continued to improve. The remainder of the patient&apos;s
hospital course will be dictated via systems.
Neurologically , at the time of transfer out of the ICU , the
patient was noted to have subtly improving mental status. Her
family described her at baseline. During her stay on the floor ,
her Zyprexa dose was decreased. She had no further neurologic
issues.
Cardiovascular: In the intensive care unit , the patient required
vasopressin initially and was weaned off during the first three
or four days. Her chronic atrial fibrillation continued. She
was transferred out of the intensive care unit on IV Lopressor
which was gradually converted to p.o. as she tolerated a regular
diet. She was discharged on 100 mg q.i.d. of Lopressor.
Respiratory: In the intensive care unit , she was noted to have
respiratory failure initially secondary to a SIRS picture and
fluid overload. This significantly improved with diuresis. She
was transferred out on a nasal cannula. On the floor , she had no
respiratory issues. She continued her aggressive chest physical
therapy and was out of bed with physical therapist.
GI: In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient was noted to have a
postoperative ileus. She did not tolerate NG tube feeds. A post
pyloric Dobhoff was eventually placed and tube feeds were
initiated. After transfer out of the intensive care unit , the
patient had difficulty with her Dobhoff catheter and eventually
became clogged and had to be removed. A speech and swallow
evaluation was obtained. A bedside swallow was equivocal and a
fiberoptic swallow was done. She passed this with fine colors
per the speech and swallow team and they recommended that her
diet be advanced as tolerated. She was discharged to
rehabilitation on a regular diet.
GU: In the Intensive Care Unit , she was massively resuscitated
initially and then diuresed for virtually the remainder of her
hospital course. An initial Lasix drip was then changed to IV
Lasix boluses. She was discharged on p.o. Lasix at an equivalent
dose to her standing Lasix during her hospitalization. A
cystogram was obtained prior to her discharge to rehab at the
time of dictation. The result of the cystogram are not
available. If no extravasation is noted , her Foley catheter can
be removed at rehabilitation. If extravasation is noted , she
will need to undergo a repeat cystogram at some point in the
future prior to removal of her Foley catheter.
Heme: The patient was initially on subcu heparin due to concern
for bleeding. She was then started on a heparin drip and was
discovered that she had bilateral lower extremity partial DVTs.
Her heparin drip was titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 prior to
discharge to rehab. Her heparin was discontinued and she was
started on Lovenox as a bridge to coumadinization. Her Coumadin
began during the few days prior to her discharge when she was
tolerating p.o. intake.
ID: Due to the colovesical fistula , concern for some liver
opacities on her original abdominal CTs , she was placed on
broad-spectrum antibiotics perioperatively. All antibiotics were
removed on 1/22/05 .  She was noted to have a candidal UTI ,
completed a five-day course of fluconazole. A small fever in the
Intensive Care Unit warranted blood cultures being sent and
repeat blood cultures on 10/4/05 eventually noted a
gram-positive cocci. It was felt that this was likely due to a
contaminant as the patient by that time had been afebrile for
several days. However , she was started on vancomycin for
gram-positive cocci , bacteremia. Her central line was removed
and a new central line was placed and she was discharged to rehab
on day 9 of 14 of IV vancomycin via her central line. After the
completion of this course of therapy , her central line may be
removed at rehabilitation.
Wound: Due to some drainage from abdominal wound due to her fat
necrosis , the lower portion of the wound was opened. There was
no evidence of active infection noted and a Vac sponge was placed
initially on 10/4/05 to facilitate the healing process. The Vac
was changed every three days during her stay. This most recent
change was on 10/30/05 .

RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Head CT/CTA , 60 mL intracranial
hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia with intraventricular
hemorrhagic extension , and casting of the right lateral ventricle
and extension into the third and fourth ventricles. Compared to
the Rea Hospital CT scan from 3 hours earlier , there was enlargement
of the intracranial hemorrhage and enlargement of the ventricles.
No AVM or aneurysm. Occluded right internal carotid artery that
reconstitutes at the level of the supraclinoid , which is old.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient remained unresponsive and intubated
during the entirety of this hospitalization. He was admitted to
the Neurological ICU following his emergency department care and
extraventricular drain placement by Neurosurgery in the emergency
department. He continued to have extraventricular drainage
throughout this hospital stay. Despite the efforts of draining
the patient&apos;s ventricles , there was no improvement in his
clinical exam. During the course of this hospitalization , the
patient did receive antibiotics ( Flagyl , levofloxacin , and
vancomycin ) for pneumonia. He received amiodarone and
beta-blockers for rapid heart rate. The patient unfortunately
did not respond to any of the above treatments , and remains

745177016 | MHMC | 00539198 | | 892058 | 10/6/1990 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Unsigned | DIS | Admission Date: 1/28/1990 Report Status: Unsigned

Discharge Date: 10/16/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 40 year old female with a
history of cholelithiasis who was
recently discharged from Asce Medical Center on November ,
l990 after an incisional hernia repair who , soon after , noted onset
of right upper quadrant pain , vomiting , and fever and was
readmitted with an ultrasound at that time showing two 8-9 mm
gallstones in the right upper quadrant. Patient was treated with
intravenous antibiotics but deferred surgery at that time and was
discharged home after defervescing. Approximately six weeks prior
to admission , the patient was seen in the Emergency Ward for
recurrent right upper quadrant pain without nausea , vomiting , or
fever. The patient then was subsequently seen by Dr. Bellman in the
Chica Onant Hospital and a cholecystectomy was scheduled on a
routine basis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-contributory. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes a cesarean section in l988 and a
ventral hernia repair in October of l990. CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Naprosyn as needed for right upper quadrant pain. ALLERGIES:
Include Penicillin which gives her a rash and Compazine which leads
to a dystonic reaction. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke or
drink.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs. SKIN: Scattered skin tags on her
trunk. NODES: Negative. HEAD/NECK: Benign. BREASTS: Without
masses , tenderness , or axillary adenopathy. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs ,
gallops , or rubs. PULSES: 2+ bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
positive bowel sounds , and non-tender with a small fascial defect
at the umbilicus and a well healed midline scar. NEUROLOGICAL:
Non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 7l
beats per minute with an axis of positive
40 degrees , normal intervals , and no ischemic changes. Her chest
X-Ray was clear. Her electrolytes were all within normal limits ,
her BUN was 22 , and her creatinine was l.0. Her glucose was 88.
Her white count was 6.4 , her hematocrit was 33.l , and her platelets
were 259. Her PT was l2.3 and her PTT was 29.9. Her urinalysis
showed 3-4 white blood cells and l+ bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient arrived the same day as her surgery
and was taken directly to the Operating Room.
Patient was placed under general anesthesia and her intubation was
particularly difficult secondary to obesity requiring fiberoptic
intubation and Anesthesia elected , at this time , to place both an
A-line and a central venous access in order to be able to optimally
monitor this difficult obese patient. Patient then underwent a
very uncomplicated cholecystectomy at which time a distended
gallbladder with several stones was found. The patient was taken
to the Recovery Room in stable condition after being extubated. Her
O2 saturation on 40% facemask was 96% in the Recovery Room and both
her nasogastric tube and Foley tube were removed without incident.
Her A-line was also removed before transfer to the floor but her
central line remained in place until the following day. Patient
received two doses of Gentamicin as prophylaxis post-operatively.
The patient had an unremarkable post-operative course with a
post-operative hematocrit of 3l.5 and white count of 8.4. Her diet
was slowly advanced and she remained afebrile with good oxygen
saturations on room air and good urine output.
DISOSITION: She was discharged to home on post-operative day
number five with an appointment to follow-up in the
Ingtondi Community Healthcare on Thursday , January , for a wound check.

and increased frequency which it seems has also been present for
weeks to months. She is not short of breath and has no headache ,
chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
numbness , LE swelling , LE pain , rash. She does have some bumps on
her abdominal wall which are painful-it sounds like these are a
direct result of the enoxaprin she had been getting for a PE in
October of this year.
The ZH ER doctor spoke with Senz at the nursing home. She said
that the patient had an x-ray two days ago which revealed pneumonia ,
and her referral states that the pneumonia was in the left upper
lobe and left lower lobe; the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg
p.o at that time. In the FMC emergency room , the patient was hydrated
with 3 liters of normal saline and her pulse still remains in the
130s. She was given Levofloxacin 500 mg IV. The ER physician was
worried about a pulmonary embolus , did not do a chest CT here
because of her elevated creatinine of 1.9. She was transferred to
the Chamvine Tionbradvar General Hospital for an MRA to rule out PE. In ER here , IJ central line
placed ( CVP~20 ) and patient given 1L NS. Blood pressure systolic
initially 120s but decreased to 90s ( MAPS&gt;70 ) , and norepinephrine
started. The NE was discontinued promptly given BP improvement
immediately , and continued
SBP&gt;100 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic breast CA-bone
scan which revealed widespread osseous metastasis , and
CNS involvement on head CT , bone marrow bx with invasive disease ,
status post brain radiotherapy 1/2 diabetes , PE 10/06 , tx with
enoxaprin through 4/06 ( discontinued because of doubt over original
dx and significant pain at injection sites ) , hypertension , arthritis ,
depression , bipolar disorder , asthma , high cholesterol , anemia , and
obesity.
ONC HISTORY: Pt presented with grade III , ER/PR/HER2-negative in
October 2004. In January 2004 , she underwent right breast lumpectomy
with pathology demonstrating 4.1 cm IDC , no LVI ,
negative sentinel lymph nodes. She underwent partial breast radiation
in January 2004 and deferred on adjuvant therapy. In August 2005 , she
presented with atypical chest wall pain and imaging showed bilateral
pulmonary nodules , thoracic lymphadenopathy , and pleural effusion
consistent with metastatic disease. A bone scan showed wide
spread osseous metastatic disease and head CT demonstrated a CNS
involvement. She was treated with whole brain radiotherapy in October
2006 and with weekly Taxol. She continued through October
2006. Restaging studies showed stable visceral disease but
progression of bony metastatic disease. Therefore on March , 2006 ,
she initiated a second-line Navelbine
therapy. PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.3po , pulse 112 regular ,
BP 120/75 , respirations 18 , sO2=100% on ambient air.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Laying in bed , coughing paroxysms. No use of
accessory muscles. HEENT: Mucosa dry. No jaundice. +conjunctival
pallor. Pupils reactive bilaterally. NECK: Supple and nontender.
Right IJ in place. HEART: S1 , S2 , tachycardic without murmurs. No
heaves. LUNGS: Crackles in the left lower chest
posteriorly , and diffuse expiratory wheezes. ABDOMEN: Soft and
nontender. Small nodule RUQ subcutaneous , mildly tender to
palpation. BACK: No
CVAT. NEUROLOGIC: A&amp;Ox4 , but somewhat sedate and with
poor attention. Radial and DP pulses are 2+. Sensation and strength
are grossly intact. EXTREMITIES: No calf warmth , erythema , or
tenderness. Mild right heel and Achilles tendon tenderness.

9/3/06: No growth
Chest x-ray: Revealed questionable left lobe infiltrate with
metastasis. EKG: 120 per minute , sinus
tachycardia. CXR: LLL opacity , LUL opacity. Hilar fullness on
the righT&gt;l , and prominent bronchi ( ?cuffing ) on right. Vertebral
fractures. LLL unchanged from 8/27 , and LUL improved C/w known
metastatic disease.
ASSESSMENT: 59 year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and a
history of pulmonary embolus presenting with one week of fatigue ,
lethargy , tachycardia and fever. History notable for
productive cough and dysuria , although the chronicity of these issues
is unclear. Now growing 1 bottle from WBH as well as NBH of GPC in
clusters empirically on Vanco , now looks to be coag
neg.Discussed with ID , would like to keep vanco PLAN:
*Tachycardia: Most likely secondary to an infection , either
pulmonary or urinary. With improvement in Cr PE CT was obtained which
was negative.Stable. d/c ASA and statin as no role for long term risk
reduction at this time.
*Cough: Productive cough , yellow to green sputum. Seems to have been
present for months , and it is unclear how much this has changed in
the past week. May be chronic secondary to tumor , or may
represent acute infection. Aspiration plausible given mental status.
The CT did not demonstrate any acute etiology for her symptoms.
*Dysuria: Again , chronicity unclear. UA and urine culture at HNH not
very suggestive of UTI , but UA here with 25 wbc and LE+. Has been on
levofloxacin , so will treat until cultures return with ceftazidime
( d/c 10/20 ). *Bacteremia: coag neg staph x2 , Vanc Sens , plan to
treat via PICC w/Vancomycin x14days *Oncology: Discussion with Dr.
Clusky , her primary oncologic fellow , who noted that from my
description the patient does not sound much different from her
baseline state. She is mildly tachycardic at baseline ( although not
to this degree ) , and has chronic productive cough and
dysuria. 5. Renal: ARF , improving with IVF. Likely prerenal
azotemia. 6.Heme: Chronic anemia. Given 1UPRBC in ER.
Unfortuantely , the blood was given before hemolysis or iron studies
sent. Would be indicated , especially in setting of markedly elevated
PT. Should be sent in future. I have called and added
on a peripheral manual blood smear. Last INR similarly elevated ( but
I believe patient was on enoxaprin at that time ). Not on enoxaprin
or warfarin now. May be dues to malnutrition , but
concerning for DIC or liver disease.Administered vitamin
K. 7.Psych: Resumed home zoloft , restart
geodon prn. 8.Goals of care: Discussed with the patient and
Dr. Pinion . The patient expresses that she wants to be intubated or
have defibrillation if needed. Dr. Ellestad has discussed this numerous
times with her , and will readdress.

Discharge Date: 5/25/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INCARCERATED UMBILICAL HERNIA.
HISTORY: Jewell Gauthreaux is a 78 year old woman with a complex past
medical history including coronary artery disease with a
history of MIs times two in the past , a history of DVT back in
1970 , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis , gout and history of
atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter as well as onset adult
diabetes mellitus. She presented to the Rial Community Hospital on
the day of admission complaining of an umbilical bulge over the
past several weeks. This umbilical bulge had been increasing
somewhat in size , but had not bothered her and was always
reducible. However , over the preceding weekend it became
incarcerated and then became somewhat painful. It was not
associated with any nausea or vomiting and she reported that she
was having normal bowel movements even in the face of this problem.
She presented initially to the Sey Al Skaez County Health Center and was
admitted with the diagnosis of incarcerated umbilical hernia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease with a history of MI times two in the
past with a recent echocardiogram on 11/8 showing an EF of
55-60%.
2. History of DVT in 1970.
3. Hypertension.
4. Rheumatoid arthritis.
5. Gout.
6. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter on Coumadin.
7. Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post appendectomy.
2. Status post mitral valve replacement with St. Jude valve.
3. Left hip fracture repair.
4. Status post mitral valve commissurotomy in 1955.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 80 mg a day , sublingual
nitroglycerin p.r.n. , Propafenone 225 mg
t.i.d. , Lopressor 150 mg b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg a day and
Micronase 10 mg b.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg a day
with 2-1/2 mg every Sunday.
ALLERGIES:: She is allergic to aspirin and penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an extremely pleasant elderly woman
in no acute distress. HEENT - showed
extraocular movements intact. Pupils equally round and reactive to
light. NECK - supple. HEART - regular rhythm. LUNGS - clear.
ABDOMEN - soft , nontender , nondistended with approximately 1.5 cm
in diameter umbilical hernia to the left of her umbilicus. This
hernia was somewhat tender to palpation , but showed no overlying
erythema or evidence of necrosis. She had normal bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. NEUROLOGIC - intact.
Preoperative laboratory showed BUN of 35 , creatinine 1.3 ,
hematocrit 42.0 , white count 6.8 , coagulation studies within normal
limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Peick was admitted to the Lum Hospital on the day of admission with the
diagnosis of incarcerated umbilical hernia. Because of her history
of coumadinization for both her mitral valve as well as her atrial
fibrillation it was felt that it would be necessary to hospitalize
her , hold her Coumadin and heparinize her until it was possible to
do her surgery. However , upon arrival here her admission INR was
noted to be subtherapeutic at 1.3 and she was , therefore ,
immediately started on heparin. The Cardiology Service was
consulted regarding her significant past cardiac history and
recommended an echocardiogram to be performed preoperatively. This
echo was done on 9/6/98 demonstrating an EF of 55% with an
abnormal subdural wall motion , trace areas of aortic insufficiency
and mildly increased right ventricular size and the artificial
mitral valve was noted to be functioning well. The cardiology felt
that in the face of this largely unchanged echocardiogram that
showed stable and should go to the operating room for repair of
umbilical hernia. On 7/1/98 the patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent umbilical hernia repair with primary
reapproximation of the fascia. The procedure was done without any
complications. She was extubated and transferred in stable
condition to the postoperative recovery area and observed on the
floor. She was immediately restarted on her Coumadin as well as
her heparin which she continued for the next three days
postoperatively. The patient did quite well with gradual up in her
INR to a greater than 2 level and she was discharged to home on
4/23/98 on a regular dose.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q four hours p.r.n.

Discharge Date: 9/10/1993
DIAGNOSIS: OSTEOARTHRITIS LEFT HIP.
STATUS POST OSTEOTOMY FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS
OF THE RIGHT HIP.
HISTORY OF SLEEP APNEA.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: LEFT TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT BY DR. KOBA ON
22 of April .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old male with
left hip pain , now worsening over the
past year , unrelieved with conservative therapy. The patient has a
history of congenital dysplasia of the hip , which was treated with
osteotomy of the right hip in 1988 , with good improvement. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY was also remarkable for sleep apnea. ALLERGIES
included intravenous pyelogram dye and shrimp. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION were none.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese white male in no
acute distress. He ambulated with a truncal
lurch to the left. Head and neck were within normal limits. Lungs
were clear. Cardiac examination was regular. Abdomen was obese ,
but benign. The left hip was remarkable for being 3/4 inch longer
than the right leg. Flexion was limited to 90 degrees , with 10
degrees lacking full extension. External rotation was 30 degrees ,
internal rotation 0 , abduction 30 degrees with increased pain , and
adduction 20 degrees. The patient&apos;s neurovascular examination was
within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 22 of April , and
underwent left total hip replacement which he
tolerated well. Estimated blood loss was 400 cc. The patient was
in stable condition for the entire hospital stay. His immediate
postoperative hematocrit was 36.3. The patient was febrile for the
first postoperative day , but rapidly defervesced on perioperative
antibiotics with Ancef. On postoperative day #2 , hematocrit had
dropped to 29 and the patient received 2 units of autologous blood ,
which increased his hematocrit to 36. The patient remained stable
over 30 for the rest of his hospital course.
The incision was examined on postoperative day #1 , and was found to
be clean and dry. The patient started physical therapy on
postoperative day #1 , and made rapid progress. The patient was
anticoagulated with Coumadin for a prothrombin time in the range of
14 to 16 , and stabilized at a dose of 8 milligrams per night. At
the last dose , his prothrombin time had gone up over 16 and he was
changed to Coumadin 5 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep. The
patient was cleared by the Physical Therapy Service and cleared
medically for discharge home on postoperative day #6.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. The patient
is to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Mcfadden in 5 weeks.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Coumadin for a full 6-week
course , Percocet as needed. The patient will FOLLOW-UP with the
Coumadin Program through this hospital. The patient had no
problems with his breathing and will require no special therapy at
this time. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was good.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: WAXMAN , MARCELLUS H. MD , PHD
SERVICE:
CCU Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease and aspirin allergy.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Peptic ulcer disease.
5. Colonic polyps.
6. Prostate adenocarcinoma.
7. Pancreatic cancer , metastatic.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Galle is a 67-year-old man with cardiac risk factors
including hypertension , hypercholesterolemia. His CAD history
begins one year ago when he began to experience resting jaw pain
responsive to two to three sprays of nitroglycerin. On 5/10/05 ,
he presented to Woodterra Raville Center with this pain and he was found to
have T wave inversion , ST depressions in V6 , V1 and aVL. At that
point , his cardiac markers peaked at troponin of 29.6. He was
taken to the catheterization lab where he was found to have a 90%
RCA stenosis. He underwent angioplasty and bare metal stent
placement. After the catheterization , he had six weeks without
pain but over the last two weeks he had begun to experience
increasing jaw pain that was minimally responsive to
nitroglycerin spray. He presented for elective recatheterization
on 1/4 the day of his admission and was found to have 70% LAD
lesion and a 40% proximal RCA lesion. A Cypher stent was placed
in the LAD. He was started on Integrilin for 24 hours and sent
to the CCU for aspirin desensitization. He has taken aspirin for
headaches in his teens and developed rashes. He had taken
aspirin a few times in his 20s and 30s without any recalled side
effects. However , he did take 12 years ago , a dose of
indomethacin and reportedly had to be inducted into a coma in the
hospital for severe adverse reaction to the indomethacin. He
cannot elaborate further on what this reaction was. Therefore ,
given the need to be on aspirin for his new Cypher stent , he was
admitted to the CCU for a course of desensitization.
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
Include Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. ,
captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m. ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , Creon six tablets p.o. daily , Lantus 4
units subcutaneous q.h.s. , Humalog subcutaneous with meals , as
needed nitroglycerin sublingual tablets.
ALLERGIES:
Include aspirin , penicillin and NSAIDs which produce rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No tobacco , alcohol or other drug use history. He lives with his
wife and performs clerical work and can perform activities of
daily living without issue.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Mother had esophageal cancer , his father had renal cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 96.9 , pulse 87 , blood pressure 130/60 , O2 saturation
97% on room air. His exam was significant for being thin ,
fatigued man with mild icterus , mildly bleeding gums. JVP at 11
cm. III/VI harsh systolic murmur at the base. III/IV diastolic
murmur at the base. His lung exam was clear bilaterally. His
abdomen was soft , nontender with two ventral hernias without
issue. He was alert and oriented x3 and had mild 1+ edema
bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES:
His white count was 5.4 , hematocrit 30.2 , platelets 251 , 000.
Creatinine was 1.2 after catheterization. His INR was 1.3. CK
was 42 , troponin 0.12.
PROCEDURES:
Catheterization went without event with stenting of his LAD 70%
lesion with Cypher stent.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac. Mr. Celeste cardiac catheterization went
smoothly with identified 70% mid proximal LAD lesion and proximal
40% RCA lesion. A Cypher stent was placed in the LAD , and he was
started on Integrelin and sent to the CCU. His Plavix and Imdur
were continued as per his home dose. His beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor were held for anticipation of aspirin desensitization.
He did not experience any further chest pain or jaw pain during
his stay and was stable hemodynamically.
2. Allergy. It was agreed that his aspirin should be taken
given that he now has a Cypher stent. Given his vague history of
possible aspirin allergy and question of anaphylactic shock
induced by NSAIDs , it was decided to desensitize him to 81 mg of
aspirin. This was done as per protocol defined by Allergy
Consult Service with doubling increments starting at 5 mg and
going to 81 mg of aspirin over the course of two hours every 30
minutes. Epinephrine and Benadryl were kept at bedside but were
not required because he had no adverse reaction to any of the
doses.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on all his
home medications as previously prescribed plus aspirin 81 mg each
day. He was instructed that it was important to take his aspirin
every day because if he missed a dose he may have an allergic
reaction that his desensitization was designed to avoid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be started one day after
discharge.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.
4. Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m.
5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Creon six tablets p.o. daily.
7. Lantus 4 units subcutaneous q.h.s.
8. Humalog subcutaneous with meals.
9. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual as needed.
10. Aspirin 81 mg every day.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient was instructed to call the Asound Hospital
Allergy Service for outpatient appointment within two to four
weeks. He was to contact the Onco/Allergy fellow if he
experiences any itching or rash in the next few days.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: lethargy , unsteady gait -- readmission after
similar symptoms Wed .
HPI:60M w/ newly-diagnosed DM , hyperlipidemia , glaucoma , h/o EtOH
abuse , and erectile dysfunction presents to ED for 2nd time in 3 days
w/ unsteadiness and sleepiness. He was admitted 1/29/06 with similar
sleepiness and poor hand coordination and trouble driving , was brought
to ED somnolent and found to have BS 200-300. Workup including head
CTA , MR were negative and patient d/c&apos;ed Thursday night w/ metformin and
plans for Holter and TTE on Monday. Patient felt great until Friday
morning when noted to have unsteadiness and sleepiness , similar but less
severe than Wed. Returned to ED with BS 277. No fevers , headaches , focal
neuro findings , vertigo , visual changes , CP , SOB , n/v , abd pain ,
dysuria , joint pain. Reported small rash on penis for which was taking
acyclovir this week but stopped Wed for possible neuro side effects.
Admit labs significant for glucose 314 , elevated lipids ( Chol 302 , Trig
323 , LDL 189 ) , otherwise normal , negative cardiac enzymes. Urine toxin
screen was negative. CBC normal except for MCV 78 with normal iron
studies and normal RBC mass. HbA1c was 11.1%. EKG had old j-point
elevation laterally , otherwise NSR without LVH or LAE. Physical and neuro
exam normal. MRI/MRA and CTA were unremarkable in 1st admission 2 days
prior and so were not repeated. Patient was stable overnight and felt
great on Saturday 3/4/06 morning. No abnormal events were recorded on
telemetry overnight and after patient was walked around the floor.
Patient sugars were managed o/n with sliding scale insulin and diabetic
low-fat house diet , and blood sugar in morning responded down to 185.
.
Explanations for episodes considered were TIA of posterior circulation
vs. seizure , less likely atypical migraine or sleep disorder -- see admit
notes for discussion.
.
At time of discharge , patient was stable and feeling very good , eager to
leave for an afternoon function and preferred not to stay for further
workup. He will followup with Dr. Clesen on Monday. He will be evaluated
this week with TTE with bubble-study to r/o intracardiac source or PFO.
Would also consider EEG if Neurology deems possibility of seizure. In the
meantime , added low-dose glyburide to metformin to manage hyperglycemia
at home , with more strips to monitor blood sugars 3-4x / day. Have also
increased aspirin dose from 81 mg to 325 mg qd. Patient was also given
prescription for automatic BP cuff for monitoring at home.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: To better manage your blood sugars , added glyburide which you should take
once a day in addition to metformin twice a day. Continue to check your
blood sugars 3-4 times per day. You can also obtain an automatic BP cuff
for monitoring at home. If episode recurs , do not drive , check
sugars and BP , drink fluids , contact MD or return to ED as soon as
possible.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
f/u with Dr. Wantuck on February , that week should have TTE with bubble
study to evaluate heart , EEG to r/o seizure , titer hyperglycemia meds

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
53 y.o african american woman w/ HTN ,
hypercholesteroleia , morbid obesity presents with 1 month intermittent
chest pressure sometimes associated with sob , diaphoresis.
Pressure sensation became more frequent--once a day for
the past week , and now radiates to left arm. No n/v/f/c/orthopnea/doe.
At baseline , has short walking tolerance. Was late for pot medical center appt.
today-- was sent to ED for r/o. CK 79 , TnI 0.0 and
EKG with t wave inversions v5-6 , inverted P waves v1-2 of unclear
significance. Pt. ruled out for MI by enzymes , and had adenosine mibi
and echo. MIBI showed sm. amt. of inferolateral reversible ischemia ,
sum stress score 4 ( 4-8 mild abnl ) , and on echo , there is hypokinesis
of inferolateral wall. LV is dilated , EF 45%. Etiology of
cardiomyopathy will need to be followed up with cardiologist , and
because the area of reversible ischemia was so small , she will be
medically managed. Pt. started on ACEI , ASA , zocor , atenolol ( 12.5 mg
dose chosen b/c pt. has had HR 64 and pressures in low 100&apos;s ) , zantac ,
NGSL prn. She will continue on HCTZ and vioxx usual meds.
Pt. was discharged home 2/16 after the test , and will follow up with
Dr. Tait , will need referral to cardiologist. Also suggest sleep study
given body habitus , snoring , and ?adequate oxygenation.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have had chest pain that was concerning for a heart attack. Your
blood lab tests show that you did not have a heart attack. Your stress
test was abnormal but can be treated by medications.
You should cont. your medications , and also take atenolol , lisinopril ,
zantac , zocor 10 mg once/day at night for your high cholesterol , lis in
addition to a baby aspirin ( 81 mg ) once a day. Call Dr. Stichter to set up
a folllow up appointment within 1 wk , you may need to see a

39.8 , platelet count 367 , 000. PT 12.1 , PTT 19.5. INR 1.0.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Lofstrom is a 57-year-old female with a
past medical history of hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , multinodular goiter , arthritis and questionable
recurrent bouts of generalized weakness who was admitted for new
onset of right sided weakness ( three days prior to admission ) ,
right leg numbness and weakness , right arm clumsiness followed by
dysarthria.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. NEUROLOGY: The patient was felt to have a probable subcortical
stroke of the left hemisphere with preservation of the speech
processing abilities with dense motor and sensory involvement.
This was felt to potentially represent an MCA branch occlusion with
increased edema versus a large lacuna. In addition , given her
history , the team was unable to rule out the possibility of an
embolic event. Therefore , the patient was admitted and ruled out
for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were 25 , 37 , 37 and 32. She
was placed on a cardiac monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia.
she was placed on subcu heparin and started on full dose aspirin
325 milligrams p.o. q.d.
In order to further work up the etiology for stroke , the patient
had an echocardiogram done which revealed evidence of concentric
LVH with preserved systolic function , calculated ejection fraction
of 55%. Other than nonspecific septal abnormality , there was no
evidence of regional wall motion dysfunction. There were early
changes of mitral annular calcification present , some increased
excursion of the mitral leaflet , but this is associated with only
trivial regurgitation. Trileaflet aortic valve without
dysfunction. One plus tricuspid regurgitation. Peak doppler flow
velocity across the tricuspid valve reached 2.5 meters per second
consistent with normal right heart systolic pressures. There was
no evidence of effusion. In addition , the patient underwent
carotid noninvasive studies which revealed no evidence of
hemodynamically significant disease in either carotid artery with
those arteries having minimal plaque and 1-25% stenosis. In
addition , the patient had an MRI/MRA to further evaluate potential
lesions. On MRI there was a focal area of increased T2 signal in
the posterior limb of the left internal capsule , close the genu.
This area demonstrated restricted diffusion on EPI diffusion ,
weighted sequence. A similar smaller area of signal abnormality
was noted in the left globus pallidus adjacent to the left internal
capsule abnormality. These areas represent subacute infarctions.
The ventricles and sulci were minimally prominent , consistent with
the patient&apos;s age. There was no other signal abnormality noted.
Major vascular flow voids were normal. There was no mass or mass
effect. Three D , TOF MRN angiogram on the circle of Willis and its
major tributaries did not demonstrate any abnormality. Incidental
note was made of a dominant right vertebral artery. The formal
impression revealed subacute infarcts involving the posterior limb
of the internal capsule on the left as well as the left globus
pallidus. Unremarkable MR angiogram on the circle of Willis.
In addition , given the patient&apos;s history of polymyalgias , an ESR
and C-reactive protein were obtained. The ESR was 46. The
C-reactive protein was 1.13. The stroke service was asked to
comment on the possibility of a vasculitic process. In addition ,
the patient&apos;s primary rheumatologist was consulted as well. The
patient&apos;s primary rheumatologist felt that the patient&apos;s stroke was
most likely due to small vessel disease associated with diabetes
and hypertension. He felt there was no evidence for a vasculitis.
He therefore suggested to continue aspirin , but in higher doses to
alleviate her left shoulder pain. The patient did not feel that
she had any vasculitic process. They therefore recommended
continuing aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. , checking a serum
homocystine which remains pending at the time of this dictation ,
reviewing her carotid studies ( mentioned above ) , and continue with
physical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy.
PT and OT were consulted as well as Speech Therapy.
In addition to continuing the patient on aspirin , continuing subcu
heparin while the patient was immobile , the patient&apos;s
antihypertensives were held in order to maintain a systolic blood
pressure between 140-160 and a diastolic blood pressure between
85-90 for the first ten days following her stroke. For the first
few days , the patient was kept in a lying position as much as
possible and her activity level was gradually increased to the
point where she was participating in full PT/OT. At the time of
this dictation , the patient&apos;s Norvasc continued to be held with
excellent control of her blood pressure between systolic of
140-160. It should not be reinitiated until roughly ten days after
her stroke.
The patient had relatively poor return of function during her
hospital stay , but was felt to be a good candidate for potential
rehabilitation. Therefore when her medical issues were stable , she
was considered ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility in
an attempt to further improve her neurologic function. As noted
previously , the patient&apos;s antihypertensives should be reinitiated
gradually with a goal systolic blood pressure between 140-160 with
a diastolic blood pressure of 85-90 to be initiated roughly ten
days from the time of her stroke ( presented on 8/17/98 ). As noted
by the work up , the patient had no evidence of an embolic source
for her stroke and her carotid studies were unremarkable.
2. RHEUMATOLOGIC: As noted , the patient has a long history of
diffuse arthritic complaints. She had her sed rate and C-reactive
protein checked. Rheumatology was consulted who felt that her
stroke was not consistent with a vascular process. They did
recommend checking a urinalysis to check for red blood cells and
casts. Her urinalysis showed no protein , no blood , 0-2 red blood
cells , no casts. Only other recommendation was to continue aspirin
and consider higher doses to alleviate left shoulder pain. In
addition , recommended avoiding nonsteroidals while the patient was
on aspirin.
3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and
had not taken her insulin for several days prior to admission. The
patient was placed on her regular insulin schedule as well as a
sliding scale. The patient&apos;s blood sugar has ranged from the 150
to the high 200s. As the patient&apos;s diet returns to baseline , she
may require adjustments of her NPH and regular insulin doses. In
addition , the patient&apos;s Premarin was held during this admission and
further therapy should be decided by the patient&apos;s follow up
neurologist.
4. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient initially
appeared somewhat dehydrated on admission and was therefore
rehydrated with IV fluids. She had good resolution and returned to
baseline of her BUN and creatinine. She was eating well at the
time of discharge. Close observation was paid to her electrolytes
including her potassium. Her electrolytes should be periodically
monitored at least once a week at rehabilitation. She does have a
history of hyperkalemia and should be watched carefully for this.
5. SOCIAL WORK: The patient initially made a comment to the
Medical Team that she had been abused by her husband. The social
worker was consulted and asked to see her regarding this issue of
spouse abuse. It is true that her husband had hit her in the
forehead with a baseball bat in the past. He died several years
ago and no further abuse history could be elicited since his death.
She currently has two supportive children.
The patient was considered stable and ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility. When the date of her transfer is made
available , her discharge medications will be dictated along with
follow up.

Discharge Date: 6/1/1997
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) OSTEONECROSIS OF RIGHT HIP
( 2 ) PAROXYSMAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA
PROCEDURE: RIGHT TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73 year old female
who developed new onset of right sided
hip pain approximately four months ago. She is now severely
limited in her ambulation , as well as activities of daily living ,
secondary to her right hip pain. On radiographs she was
demonstrated to have osteonecrosis of the right hip. There is no
history of steroid or steroid boluses or alcohol use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Degenerative joint disease bilateral hands.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post varicose vein stripping and
bilateral cataract surgery.
MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg
q.d. , Voltaren 75 mg b.i.d. , Cimetidine 300 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Permatol 2.5 mg b.i.d. , and Levoxil 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese female with an
antalgic gait on the right. No
lymphadenopathy. HEENT: Benign. She has dentures. Lungs clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.
Infrequent ectopic beats. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended.
Extremities: The right lower extremity sensation and motor are
intact. She has a 30 degree straight leg raise , 90 degrees of
flexion , 10 degrees of internal rotation , 30 degrees of external
rotation , and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse.
LABORATORY DATA: X-rays demonstrated collapse of the right femoral
head consistent with osteonecrosis on the right.
An old MRI scan also shows these osteonecrotic changes in the right
femoral head.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
10/16/97 .  She underwent a right total hip
replacement. The details of this procedure can be seen in the
operative note. Postoperatively the patient was maintained on
Coumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. She had a PCA for
pain control and this was quite adequate. She received one unit of
autologous blood for a postoperative hematocrit of 29 on
postoperative day #1. She did not require any further transfusions
and the last hematocrit prior to discharge was 35.4.
Postoperatively the patient developed numerous paroxysmal episodes
of supraventricular tachycardia. A medicine consult was obtained
and it was recommended that she be placed on Verapamil 80 mg t.i.d.
This appeared to work at first; however , it was unable to control
her tachycardia , particularly with any activity. The patient was
then placed on Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. and the Verapamil was
discontinued. The patient did quite well with this and her
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia resolved. She was able to
progress with physical therapy without any episodes of increase in
heart rate. The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and her CK and MB remained negative. Her Hemovac was removed on
postoperative day #1. She had her wound inspected on postoperative
day #2 and thereafter her incision remained clean , dry , and intact
without any evidence of erythema or drainage. As mentioned
previously the patient was maintained on Coumadin for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis. She worked with physical therapy on a
daily basis and progressed well once her heart rate was under
control.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was tolerating a
regular diet. She was working daily with physical
therapy and progressing well. She had resolution of her paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia with heart rate down into the 80s and
90s on Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. She had a stable hematocrit and
remained on Coumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Her
incision appeared clean , dry , and intact without any evidence of
infection. She had lower extremity non-invasive tests , as well as

Discharge Date: 1/22/2005
ATTENDING: NAVAS , ROBT MD
DISPOSITION: Short-term rehab.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: MSSA bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old man with a
history of bioprosthetic aortic valve , status post PPM and ICD
placement , who is transferred from Ties The Whiash County Hospital for workup
of bacteremia and concern for sepsis and endocarditis with early
evidence of multiorgan failure. He is 13 years&apos; status post
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and also has a history of
afib with diastolic heart failure and a permanent pacemaker , on
Coumadin therapy. Ten days prior to admission to the Josesanderstlake Medical ,
he had extraction of all his remaining teeth. Following that , he
had a gradual onset of malaise , shortness of breath , and general
weakness. He was admitted to Sonbyrd Lanor Community Hospital following a
fall to the ground where he was found to be febrile with
leukocytosis and there was a question of left lower lobe
infiltrate. Blood cultures at Kimau Hospital Of quickly returned positive
with Staphylococcus aureus. PE was performed , which was negative
for vegetation , but the patient&apos;s oxygen requirement increased
and his blood pressure seemed to be dropping , and thus he was
transferred to Lo Memorial Hospital for further workup and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Afib , hypertension , diastolic dysfunction ,
echo in 1999 with moderate concentric LVH and EF of 65% , right
heart catheterization in 2000 showed elevated right heart filling
pressures and wedge pressure which increased with exercise ,
cardiac output of 4.4 , status post 27-mm bioprosthetic AVR and
ascending two grafts in 1992 , afib with diastolic heart failure ,
left bundle-branch block , permanent pacemaker , hypothyroidism ,
type II diabetes , obesity , distant cholecystectomy , AAA , status
post repair ( ? ) , thrombocytopenia , gout , prostate cancer , status
post hormone therapy , and diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were lisinopril 5 q.o.d. ,
allopurinol 100 b.i.d. , glyburide 6.25 q. day , levothyroxine 100 ,
Zoloft 50 , Protonix 40 , Lasix 60 , and Coumadin 2.5.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his daughter who is very
supportive and his wife in Ver He is retired. No
history of tobacco or alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , the patient appeared ill. He was
slightly lethargic. Slightly uncomfortable. His oxygen was 96%
on 4 L of oxygen. Heart rate 70s. Blood pressure in the low
80s. Temperature 99.1. HEENT: Notable for slightly elevated
JVP. His lungs showed decreased breath sounds at the left and
right base with rales up to one-third on the right side. His PMI
was nondisplaced. He was in an irregular S1 , normal S2 with no
rubs or gallops. There was a 1/6 systolic murmur at the base.
JVP was approximately 15 cm. Pulses were 2+ and equal
bilaterally. No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He was oriented
to person , time , and generally to place , but not to date. His
remainder of neurological exam was grossly intact.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 4.3 , BUN 36 ,
creatinine 2.5 , white count 8.1 , hematocrit 39.4 , CK and
troponins were negative , and INR 2.0. Chest x-ray on admission
showed a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate by report. It
also revealed a left pleural effusion with a question of
infiltrate and a right pleural effusion. EKG showed afib , left
axis deviation , and left bundle-branch block. Echo done at the
bedside shows an EF of approximately 45% to 50% without gross
regional wall motion abnormalities with some paradoxical motion
consistent with left bundle-branch block. There is no obvious
vegetation , but this was a limited study.
HOSPITAL COURSE AND PLAN PER SYSTEM:
Shortly after admission to the Cardiology Team , the patient
continued to have borderline blood pressures. His blood cultures
again grew out MSSA and his oxygen requirement increased and he
was transferred to the CCU for central monitoring and further
supportive care. In the CCU , he was continued on antibiotics.
Initially , the patient was on vancomycin for concern for MRSA.
When his cultures came back , he was switched over initially to
Ancef and gentamicin and then on consultation with ID to
nafcillin. The patient briefly required pressors , but then after
receiving IV fluids and continued antibiotics , his blood pressure
normalized to approximately 90 to 100.
Remainder of hospital course by system:
1. ID: The patient had repeated Gram-positive bacteremia with
MSSA up until the January , 2005 , after which time his daily
cultures have shown no growth to date. As above , the patient
will be maintained on nafcillin , gentamicin was discontinued , and
the patient was started in rifampin on 5/24/05 , both antibiotics
which he should continue for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Daily blood
cultures do not need to be resumed unless the patient has a
temperature at which point he should be cultured. He has been
afebrile for the last 3 to 4 days prior to discharge. We did not
do a TEE as the patient is likely not a surgical candidate and he
was felt to be at very high risk of intubation , should he become
septic again or spike temperatures this would be reconsidered.
In the interim , the patient should continue with antibiotics and
follow up with ID Clinic in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.
2. Cardiac:
Ischemia: The patient had a very small troponin leak of 0.15 on
March , 2005 , otherwise his troponins were negative. This was
likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis. After the
patient&apos;s blood pressure improved , we started him on a low-dose
beta-blocker , which he should continue. We held his ACE as his
blood pressure was generally about 90 to 100. If his blood
pressure improves slightly , we would recommend restarting the ACE
as an outpatient.
Pump: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and
an EF of 40%. He was slightly fluid overloaded after transfer
back from the CCU in the setting of getting fluids for sepsis.
He was diuresed intermittently very gently with IV Lasix at 20 ,
which seemed to improve the patient&apos;s shortness of breath and
wheezing , which correlated with the patient being more wet. He
was restarted on his own Lasix of 60 , for which he should
continue and also recommend having the patient receive daily
weight checks and to adjust Lasix in order to maintain daily
weight.
Rhythm: The patient is afib with left bundle-branch block
occasionally and RVR at Ening Health , which seemed to
correlate with fevers. But , he had a normal rate while inhouse
especially while on beta-blocker. He has an AICD , which seemed
to be working fine inhouse as well as a pacemaker.
2. Pulmonary: The patient has maintained on 2 to 3 liters at
which he is saturating at 93% to a 100%. He will likely need
oxygen for a few more days as some of his remaining fluid is
taken off. Please check oxygen saturations daily and titrate off
oxygen as he is able to.
3. Renal: The patient is with chronic renal insufficiency ,
baseline of 1.7. His range in the hospital was 1.7 to 2.5.
Pheno was checked which was approximate 33% and he did not have
any urine Eos or caths to suggest allergic interstitial nephritis
or ATN. Please repeat a creatinine in one week to ensure that it
remains stable. I suspect that as some of his fluid is taken
off , his flow will be better and his creatinine will be slightly
improved.
4. Endo: The patient is with diabetes. He was initially on
Portland protocol while in the Intensive Care Unit. On the
floor , he was maintained on NPH and a Regular Insulin sliding
scale. He should continue on NPH and this should be titrated in
order to maximize blood sugar control , so he should continue on a
Regular Insulin sliding scale. Once the patient is ready for
discharge to home , he should be switched back to his oral
hypoglycemics.
5. Heme: We held the patient&apos;s Coumadin or anticoagulation as
it is contraindicated in the setting of endocarditis. Now that
his sepsis seems to resolve , the patient should be restarted on
his Coumadin in approximately 3 to 4 days after discharge with a
goal of an INR of 2 to 3.
6. Psyche: The patient remained generally oriented to person
and situation to hospital while inhouse , but occasionally slide
down especially in the setting of having fevers. He was
continued on his home Zoloft and we added a small dose of
Zyprexa , which seemed to also help. The patient benefits from
regular reorientation which we suggest continuing.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is to receive heparin t.i.d. and
PPI for DVT and ulcer prophylaxis respectively.
8. Access: The patient now has a PIC line , which is in place
and can be used for IV antibiotics.
DISCHARGE DIET: His discharge diet is a 2-g sodium ADA 1800 to
2000 calories per day , low saturated fat , low cholesterol , and
mechanical soft.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications are as follows;
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. pain or temperature , aspirin 81
mg daily , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 60 p.o. daily , heparin 5000
units subcutaneous t.i.d. , NPH 16 units q.p.m. , Regular insulin
sliding scale a.c. and h.s. , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , rifampin 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 p.o. daily , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg
nebs q.4h. p.r.n. wheezing , nafcillin 2 g IV q. 4h , Zyprexa 2.5
mg p.o. nightly , miconazole 2% powder topical b.i.d. to rash ,
Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaled b.i.d. , Duoneb q. 6h.
p.r.n. wheezing , Protonix 40 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 mg p.o.
daily , and allopurinol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
TO DO: The patient should follow up with his cardiologist Dr.
Gebauer and his PCP Dr. Lowell Blass once discharged from short-term
rehab. In addition , the patient should be seen by ID Clinic in
approximately 3 weeks to discuss remaining antibiotic therapy.
In addition , the patient should have a set of labs drawn in
approximately 5 to 7 days to recheck his creatinine. Please
check blood cultures if the patient has a temperature. Please
assess the NPH regimen as above. Please restart his Coumadin at
2.5 mg in 3 days with a goal INR of 2.3.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old man with
a history of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , status post three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1993 , chronic atrial
fibrillation , and hypercholesterolemia , who presents with
complaints of recent flu-like symptoms times two days , including

nonproductive cough with chills. The patient is followed by Dr.
Strubbe of the Hufi General Hospital , and by Dr. Torri of the
Onas Medical Center cardiology team. The patient recalls flu-like symptoms in
early April 1996 , but otherwise , was well until two days ago
when he noted the onset of right sided , sharp chest pain which was
well localized to the right chest , worse with breathing and chest
movement. The patient denied any similarity to previous anginal
pain , which he noted is more substernal in nature and has not
occurred in months. The patient was concerned that the pain was
cardiac and took two sublingual nitroglycerin without relief , and
therefore , presented to the Swebrothers Hospital Emergency
Room. The patient denied any nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,
shortness of breath , abdominal pain , melena , constipation ,
diarrhea , and hemoptysis , at the time of admission. He notes
history of chronic venostasis disease in his lower extremities with
bilateral decreased sensation and episodes of neuropathy pain which
has not changed recently.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o.
q.supper , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. Sunday , Saturday ,
Tuesday , and Thursday , and 2.5 mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday , Nitro-Dur patch 8.4 mg q.a.m. off in p.m. , alprazolam up to
2 mg p.o. q.day p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. p.r.n. swelling , usually
one time per week , and Tylenol p.o. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , vital signs
included a temperature to 101.4 , pulse 92 ,
respirations 28 , blood pressure 170/74 , and O2 saturation 89% on
room air with 94%-95% on two liters O2. HEENT examination revealed
moist mucous membranes without lesions. Pupils were equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles were intact. Neck had
no LAD or JVD. Lungs had crackles present with egophony and E to A
change over the right low lateral lung field , otherwise , clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart had an irregular rhythm with a
regular rate. There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
right upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. There
was normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed
1+ bilateral pitting edema with bilateral changes of chronic
venostasis , 1+ pedal pulses on the left , but left foot slightly
cool to touch. There was no palpable pulse in the right lower
extremity , but good capillary refill and warm. Neurological
examination revealed cranial nerves II-XII were intact bilaterally.
Motor was intact bilaterally. Sensory was intact to light touch
with decrease in sensory to light touch bilateral lower
extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count was 21.12 , hematocrit
38.8 , and platelets 191. INR was 2.1 , PTT 42.3.
Sodium was 136 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 279. Admission EKG was significant for
atrial fibrillation at 76 beats per minute with evidence for cold
left bundle branch block. Chest x-ray was significant for right
middle lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for
administration of intravenous antibiotics. The
patient did well overnight. In the a.m. of 4/5/97 , the patient
had an episode of hypoxia with increased requirement for oxygen and
ultimately required 100% face mask for 93% O2 saturation. The
patient denied any anginal chest pain , nausea , vomiting , or
increased shortness of breath. A stat EKG revealed no changes.
Stat chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. This
responded well to IV Lasix. However , the patient continued to
require increased amounts of oxygen over the next two days wherein
he had further episodes of pulmonary edema requiring p.r.n. IV
Lasix. During this time , blood cultures from the time of admission
grew out Pneumococcus times two which were sensitive to penicillin.
The patient&apos;s broad coverage antibiotics were then changed to IV
penicillin. An echocardiogram obtained on 4/5/97 revealed a high
normal left ventricular size with mild concentric hypertrophy ,
hypokinesis with inferior septum , and inferior posterior region ,
ejection fraction 45% , normal RV size and function , left atrial
enlargement , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and no aortic
stenosis or insufficiency. The patient was initiated on Captopril
which was then increased titrating with the patient&apos;s blood
pressure over his hospital stay. The patient , during his hospital
course , was also noted to have increased blood sugars to the 450
range. Therefore , he was started on a sliding scale insulin
regimen.
The patient improved with regards to his hypoxia and , on the
morning of 6/15/97 , he was breathing room air with an O2
saturation of 93%. His lung examination was significant for only
rare rhonchi on the right side. Chest x-ray of 3/4/97 revealed
improvement of his right lung pneumonia with persistence of
bilateral effusions consistent with his episodes of pulmonary
edema. Fingerstick glucose was 164 reflecting an overall
improvement and decreased need for sliding scale insulin. The
patient was felt to be well and ready for discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 2.5 mg
one p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ,
and two p.o. q. Sunday , Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday , Nitro-Dur
patch 0.4 mg per day to be removed at night , Captopril 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.a.m. , penicillin-V 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.
times seven more days , Mevacor 20 mg one p.o. q.p.m. , and glipizide
5 mg one p.o. q.a.m. and two p.o. q.p.m.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged. He will be staying
with family and is to follow up with the Aer Medical Center
cardiology team in 10 days. He is also to follow up with his
Ilos Bao Hospital doctor within three weeks. The patient is not
expected to have any disability and should recover well. He has
been instructed to call should he develop a high fever , further
chest pain , or shortness of breath.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest pain
===================================================
HPI: 52 yo M with h/o DM , dyslipidemia , CAD s/p 2v CABG in &apos;02 for RCA
dissection which was a complication of PCI ( LIMA to LAD , radial to PDA ) ,
and s/p multiple catheterizations for CAD and instent restenosis
presenting with atypical chest pain at rest. Since his last intervention
in 10/24 for re-stenting of his LCx , pt had been pain free , able to walk
about 1/2 mile without difficulty. On the morning of admission pt woke
up with sharp chest pain associated with diaphoresis and tingling down
his left arm. However , the pain was different from the pressure he had
felt from his previous admissions that were positive for stenosis. Pain
was described as sharp 9/10 that improved after taking his second dose of
ntg. The diaphoresis and arm symptoms resolved concurrently with the
chest pain. He received a third dose of ntg from the EMS and brought to
ED.
Of note , one week ago patient was struck in the center of his chest by
teenagers &quot;horsing around&quot; next to him. The impact was severe enough to
cause him to fall to the ground. He noticed pain around the region for
the next several days that he described as more pressure like different
from what he felt like this morning. Also noticed that since the
incident he has felt more tired than usual.
In ED patient was hemodyanmically stable HR 54-57 BP 113-142/64-78. Pt
was afebrile breathing at 18/min O2 sat 100% 2L. He was given another
dose of ntg by nasal spray , ASA 325 mg , Dilaudid 1mg for back pain ,
Plavix 75mg , and lovenox 100 mg.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
1 ) CHEST PAIN
On arrival to the floor patient was pain free but began to experience
nausea and vomiting which was relieved by ntg and then with a dose of
compazine. It was unclear if the nausea was related to ischemia or the
dose of dilaudid he received in the ED. However there were no ECG
changes during his nausea. Altogether the nausea lasted for
approximately 10 minutes. He remained pain free during the night with
what he described as some slight pressure over his chest. His chest is
tender at baseline ever since his CABG and it was difficult to assess
whether the pain was MSK or cardiac in nature. He sometimes felt it was
different from when he first presented with an MI , and at other times he
describes the pain as being related to movement and to the kick to the
chest that he received 2 weeks earlier ( see HPI ). Overnight on HD#1
patient did not require any more NTG doses , remained hemodynamically
stable , and three sets of enzymes were negative for MI. Pt had several
admissions in the past where he presented with chest pain and underwent
catheterizations , some of which revealed restenosis and some of which
were negative. Given his presentation was very atypical it was decided to
do a stress PET the next day to assess ischemia and then re-evaluate
plan. He was kept on his home regimen of cardiac medications in addition
to lovenox 100 mg SC for ACS. On HD#2 when moving from his chair to the
bed he began to complain of 2/10 chest pressure that he says felt a
little different than the pain when palpating his chest. Again there
were no ECG changes. He underwent a stress PET which was negative for
ischemia. Given his presentation with a clearly negative study it was
most likely that his symptoms were MSK in origin.
2 ) DM2
Patient&apos;s home regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents were held and he was
treated with basal insulin and a sliding scale.
3 ) FEN
NPO for stress PET , K/Mg scales
4 ) PPX
Patient was on lovenox for ACS , PPI

ned | DIS | Admission Date: 5/30/1991 Report Status: Unsigned

Discharge Date: 2/9/1991
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: ACUTE BRONCHITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: STATUS POST AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT.
DEPRESSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old white
male who was admitted with complaints
of cough , mild shortness of breath and persistent fevers. In 1981 ,
the patient was admitted to Mimo Gnura Medical Center w
ith
syncope secondary to aortic stenosis. A porcine AVR was performed
at that time. He had an unremarkable course until 1/25/90 , when
echocardiogram performed at REH showed an AV gradient of
64 mm of
mercury , mild to moderate MR , LVH , and normal function. A blowing
diastolic murmur was noted on physical exam at that time. On
5/16/91 , the patient underwent an ETT that was nondiagnostic due
to
baseline EKG abnormalities. However , he had no substernal chest
pain after 12 minutes and 20 seconds. Around the end of October
1991 , the patient noted increasing fatigue , increased temperature ,
and some upper respiratory symptoms including cough and sore
throat. He claims that his sore throat lasted for nearly a month
then went away for one week only to return again for nearly one
month. He had been treated with amoxicillin without improvement.
One week prior to admission , he had persistent symptoms with a
cough with poor sputum production but the sputum that was produced
was yellow-green in color. He was treated with erythromycin in a
single dose before hospitalization. Also , one week prior to
admission , he noted some left chest pain without radiation that is
typical of his chest pain syndrome which had been previously
diagnosed. On the day of admission , the patient noted increased
persistent elevation in his temperature and a chest x-ray showed
questionable left lingular infiltrate that led to his admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noteable for history of adult onset
diabetes , previously treated with insulin but now diet controlled.
Status post porcine AVR secondary to rheumatic heart disease.
Atypical chest pain syndrome. Depression. MEDICATIONS: On
admission included erythromycin , Motrin and imipramine. ALLERGIES:
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: Remarkable for
significant past smoking history , past alcohol use , job as a
painter&apos;s rigger.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an obese white male
whose appearance was appropriate for his age
in moderate distress. Blood pressure was 160/90. Heart rate 80.
Temperature 101.1. Respiratory rate of 14. Skin revealed
blanching macular rash confined largely to the trunk without
splinter hemorrhages , Janeway&apos;s nodes or Osler&apos;s nodes. Cardiac
exam revealed normal sinus rhythm , III/VI holosystolic murmur at
the left sternal border , II/VI diastolic murmur at the left sternal
border and a II/VI crescendo/decrescendo murmur at the apex with
extension to the axilla. Lungs revealed scattered rhonchi and few
rales especially in the left lung field. Extremities were without
cyanosis , clubbing or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a glucose of 172. White
blood cell count 7.7. Hematocrit 41.2. Platelet
count 403 , 000. Previous work-up at AH showed an ESR o
f 24.
Urinalysis had 1+ protein , 1+ glucose , 1-3 white cells , 1-3 red
cells , trace bacteria and 2-5 hyaline casts. EKG revealed normal
sinus rhythm at 96 , intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40 with axis of -30
degrees. There was LVH with strain. Chest x-ray showed a
questionable lingular infiltrate that was read as such by one
radiologist but this was not confirmed by a second radiologist.
There was no sign of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE: When the patient was admitted , he was initially
treated as if his presenting symptoms were due to
a left lingular pneumonia despite his lack of elevated white count.
However , it was felt that endocarditis a small though real
possibility in this gentleman with AVR. Therefore , he was
originally treated with ampicillin , 2 grams IV q six hours;
gentamicin , 100 mg IV q eight hours; and erythromycin , 1 gram IV q
six hours to cover atypical bacteria including Legionella. Prior
to administering antibiotics , three blood cultures were obtained at
DH in addition to the two previously obtained at  TP .  Sputum
sample was also sent for gram stain and C&amp;S. All blood cultures
remained negative throughout the hospitalization. Sputum culture
showed only normal flora. When the second radiologist read the
chest x-ray as being inconsistent with lingular pneumonia , a more
aggressive search for possible endocarditis was undertaken. An
echocardiogram was performed on 8/19 that showed an aortic valve
with 40 mm gradient , 2-3+ AI , 1+ MR , mild LVF and no regional wall
motion abnormalities. There was no evidence of vegetation on the
echo. Side by side comparison of this echocardiogram with the
echocardiogram from 5/25 done at LGMC sho
wed no significant
interval change. An Infectious Disease consult was sought and it
was felt by these consultants that endocarditis was an unlikely
diagnosis given the lack of change in echocardiogram and lack of
additional signs of SBE. It was ultimately felt that the patient&apos;s
shortness of breath and elevated temperature were due to bronchitis
and he was switched to po Bactrim to continue a ten day course of
therapy. Although the initial goal of his hospitalization was to
keep him hospitalized until cardiac catheterization and valve
replacement could be performed , the patient&apos;s personal situation
made it unfeasible to keep him in the hospital for a longer period
of time than absolutely necessary. Furthermore , there were
questions about whether cardiac catheterization and AVR should be
performed in someone being treated for presumed acute bronchitis
and whether his very poor oral hygiene and dental work can be
corrected prior to surgery. For these reasons , Dr. Sagredo
in
Cardiology was consulted as well as Dr. Sturman in VWH Medicine and
both concurred that the patient could be discharged with close
follow-up by his primary care physician , Dr. Peltier . His co
ndition
on discharge was stable.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Bactrim DS , one
b.i.d. times seven days; imipramine , 50 mg po q h.s.;
Colace , 100 mg t.i.d.; Nystatin , 5 cc swish and spit q.i.d.;
Alupent , two puffs q six hours.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sensabaugh is a 79-year-old f
emale
with a history of Ehlers-Danlos , osteoarthritis and left knee
replacement in 1998 , and left hip replacement in 2002 who was leaving her
primary care physician&apos;s office and was hit by the elevator door and fell to
the ground. She suffered a left periprosthetic fracture of her left distal
femur. She was initially admitted to Manteton Hothood Medical Center where
she was found to have , by report , a closed distal femur fracture
between her prior ORIF and TKR with no neurovascular deficits.
Operative intervention was referred by Seases Ryn Owish General Hospital due
to her medical problems and she was treated conservatively with
nonweightbearing and a knee immobilizer. Her course there was
significant for a hematocrit drop requiring 2 units of PRBC&apos;s as
well as being ruled out for an myocardial infarction. In addition , she also
had a negative MIBI test. She was transferred to DCHO for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives in an apartment in Hiscall Hunt Laranseat Mother
recently deceased. No alcohol. No tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , heart rate
75 , blood pressure 100/50 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturations
94% on room air. No acute distress. Regular rhythm and rate.
No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Lungs , clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
Positive for colostomy. Left lower extremity in knee
immobilizer , swollen and tenderness to palpation. Left lower
extremity slightly externally rotated. Bilateral EHL/tibialis
anterior/gastrocnemius intact distally with 5/5 motor. Sensation
to intact to light touch and SPN/DP/sural/tibial nerves/saphenous
distributions. Bilateral 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Sodium 137 , potassium 3.6 , chloride 114 ,
bicarbonate 26 , BUN 17 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 148 , and calcium
9. White count 11.6 , hematocrit 39.6 , and platelets 170. INR
1.1 , PT 14.2 , and PTT 21.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon admission to SHAMC ,
Ms. Sovel underwent an echocardiogram to rule out any ca
rdiac
abnormalities. Her ejection fraction was revealed to be 50% with
no wall motion abnormalities and only mild aortic insufficiency.
She was determined to be medically stable to go the operating room by Internal
Meidicine. On January , 2005 , she underwent an open reduction
and internal
fixation of her left femur fracture with a LISS plate placement.
Postoperative film showed good placement of hardware and good
alignment of her fracture. Her postoperative course was
complicated only by mild hypotension ( systolic blood
pressures in the 70s ) and by shortness of breath. She was
successfully treated with fluid boluses and inhaled nebulizers
respectively. Postoperative chest x-ray revealed lower lobe
atelectasis. Once she was more mobile by postoperative day #3 ,
her blood pressure and O2 saturation stabilized. The remainder
of her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was kept on
perioperative antibiotics and as well as prophylactic Lovenox
while in house. She was kept touchdown weightbearing on her left
lower extremity. Her dressing was removed on postoperative day
#2. She was evaluated by physical therapy who worked with her to
increase her activity. She was deemed safe for discharge to
rehabilitation. Upon discharge , her left lower extremity was
neurovascularly intact. Her incision was clean , dry , and intact
and healing well. She is discharged in stable condition with
instruction to continue Lovenox and left lower extremity
touchdown weightbearing status until followup in clinic in two
weeks.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Touchdown weightbearing , left lower extremity.
2. Follow up with Dr. Lassetter in two weeks.
3. Continue Lovenox until next appointment with Dr. Macnaughton .

Discharge Date: 6/17/2005
ATTENDING: CLIBON , ALEC M.D.
SERVICE: NTCMH Internal Medicine
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent syncope.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac amyloidosis ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , left popliteal DVT.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.
OTHER PROCEDURES NOT DONE IN THE OPERATING ROOM: PICC line
placement on 1/22/05 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75-year-old
African-American woman with chronic renal insufficiency , coronary
artery disease , and diabetes and recent admissions for syncope
who was admitted after being found unresponsive and blue with a
systolic blood pressure in the 80s in the bathroom of her nursing
home. Her systolic blood pressure came up to 100 without
intervention , but she was sent to Ster Valley General Hospital ER for further evaluation. In the ER , her head and
spine CT was negative , her chest x-ray showed right effusion and
her cardiac enzymes were elevated with a troponin of 0.50. She
was given Lovenox , Zofran , and aspirin and admitted for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , diabetes ,
cerebrovascular accidents , cortical blindness , hypertension ,
anemia , monoclonal gammopathy , left upper extremity
thrombophlebitis.
MEDICATIONS AT NURSING HOME: Colace , Nexium , Senna , oxycodone
p.r.n. , aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Lipitor , and NPH insulin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa and propoxyphene.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.4 , blood pressure
110/80 , pulse 92 , respirations 95% on room air. The patient was
alert and oriented x1 , she was just alert and oriented to person.
Her neck vein showed a JVP less than 8 cm. Her chest was clear
to auscultation but decreased breath sounds on her right base
were noted. She had regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen was soft
with bowel sounds , nontender. Extremities remarkable for 2+
pitting edema , which were symmetric.
REMARKABLE LABS ON ADMISSION: BUN 67 , creatinine 2.6 , white
blood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit 44 , platelets 136 , BNP 880 ,
troponin 0.5.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGIC STUDIES DURING ADMISSION: CT scan to rule
pulmonary embolus on 3/25/05 was negative. Multiple chest
x-rays showed unchanged right pleural effusion , which was small
and not amenable for thoracentesis. ECG showed normal sinus
rhythm at 90 beats per minutes , low voltage , incomplete right
bundle-branch block , left axis deviation , Q-waves inferior and
anterior , no ST depressions or elevations. This was no
significant change from EKG that was done on 2/3/05 .  Lower
extremity ultrasound on 10/21/05 showed left popliteal vein
thrombosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had troponin elevations during
this hospitalization , the highest being 0.8. This was initially
thought to be consistent with a non ST elevation. However ,
patient had no EKG changes. It was also noted that the patient
had similar elevations of her troponin and was recently admitted
to an outside hospital. She was initially continued on cardiac
regimen of aspirin , Plavix , and Lopressor. On 10/21/05 , the
patient had an episode of hypotension with systolic blood
pressure in the 30s of unknown etiology. She was given IV
fluids , dexamethasone 4 mg and one dose of gentamicin and
vancomycin for presumed sepsis. A bedside echo that was done
showed severe tricuspid regurgitation , diastolic dysfunction and
ejection fraction of 40% and pulmonary pressures in the 60s.
There were wall motion abnormalities that were noted. The
patient was given additional doses of intravenous fluids and her
blood pressures came back to 120s-130s/60s-70s. At this point ,
the etiology of her low blood pressure was still unknown. On
2/16 , patient was again unresponsive with low blood pressure and
no pulse. Code was called and the patient awoke after few chest
compressions was done and had a blood pressure of 130s/70s. She
was subsequently seen by Dr. Eugenio Krucker , cardiologist at Camp Memorial Hospital , who thought her overall picture and
echocardiogram was consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. The
patient was thought to have autonomic insufficiency secondary to
amyloid neuropathy and a fixed cardiac output with restrictive
heart. Serum protein analysis subsequently revealed a
predominance of IgG light chains with elevation of both kappa and
lambda light change , which are suggestive but not confirmatory of
type AL amyloidosis. A fat pad biopsy was also done , results
were pending at discharge. Further blood samples were sent to
Perli Medical Center for further
analysis. The patient will obtain results via her primary care
physician , Dr. Emanuel Chuh . Of note , the patient had no
further hypotensive episodes prior to discharge.
2. Hematology: The patient was noted to have a low platelet
count of 136 , 000 at admission. It was thought that this could
be due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but the hep
antibody was negative. On 4/30/05 , lower extremity ultrasound
done after first episode of being unresponsive was positive for
left popliteal vein thrombosis. The patient was started on
heparin intravenous according to protocol. On 10/12/05 , the
patient had nosebleeds and hematuria and her PTT was noted to be
greater than 150. Heparin was stopped until the PTT was between
60 and 80. The bleeding stopped. She was continued on heparin
and her PTT was maintained between 60 and 80. She was later
switched to Lovenox and Coumadin maintaining her INR between 2
and 3. Lovenox was discontinued and on discharge the patient was
just on Coumadin. Her discharge INR was 2.4.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with
baseline creatinine of 2.5. A Foley was placed at admission for
patient comfort. She consistently had low urine output during
her hospitalization , averaging about 300-400 cc of urine a day
even after IV fluid administration. She had two days of
hematuria secondary to anticoagulation that resolved after
copious irrigation of the Foley. Her creatinine at discharge was
2.7. There were no acute renal issues.
4. Pulmonary: The patient required oxygen throughout her stay
to keep her saturations above 95%. She had a few episodes of
shortness of breath , which spontaneously resolved. She was given
a few doses of IV Lasix and this helped a little with her
shortness of breath , but her chest x-ray remained unchanged from
admission.
5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. She had
normal fingersticks during her hospitalization. She was on a
tight glycemic control with a regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Neuro: The patient was on aspirin and Plavix initially given
her history of CVAs and cortical blindness , but on discharge , she
was on Coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient also had a
lidocaine patch that was applied for 12 hours every day and
oxycodone was used p.r.n. pain.
7. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient received IV
fluid boluses during hypotensive episodes. Electrolytes were
followed and repeated accordingly. Nutrition was consulted and
she was placed on a soft pureed diet with a 2-L fluid
restriction , no concentrated sweets. She was also given Nepro
supplements given her renal function.
8. Line: The patient initially had an EJ line , then a femoral
line for access as peripheral access was difficult to obtain.
She then had a PICC line placed on 1/22/05 for access.
9. Disposition: There was a family meeting on 1/22/05 during
which the patient&apos;s poor prognosis was discussed with Ms. Vernon B Corippo , the patient&apos;s daughter. The family emphasized that her
code status was DNR/DNI and they were comfortable with the
discharge back to Ge Er Derd . They also emphasized that the
patient should be rehospitalized for any acute issues.
10. Code status: DNR/DNI.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , and Colace 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , regular insulin sliding
scale , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4h.

other concerns. She was also told to follow up with her primary
care physician as needed.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. The patient is to be transferred
to NC where she would be under the care of her
primary care physician , Dr. Landon Mcpeek .

right , motor was 5/5 in the left side upper extremity and lower
extremity , 5 minus deltoid on the right , and aside from that , 5
throughout , sensory examination was intact to light touch and pin
in upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally , and toes
were downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray showed no infiltrates and EKG
showed 79 , sinus rhythm , a first degree AV
block , left anterior hemi-block , a Q in III and F , and poor R wave
progression. Laboratory values showed a white count of 4.7 ,
hematocrit of 38 , platelet count of 181 , calcium was elevated at
11.5 with an albumin of 4.4 , phosphate was 3.1 , and alkaline
phosphatase 294.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for a rule out myocardial
infarction for the substernal chest pain although
there was a low index of suspicion for heart attack. She ruled out
by CK and had no EKG changes. PHC Cardiology felt that this chest
pain was not related to her heart or ischemic cause and left it up
to the primary provider , Dr. Dorset , to arrange for an out-patient
exercise stress test if felt necessary. Most likely , the chest
pain represented some type of gastroesophageal reflux disease and
the patient was restarted on Axid. Another issue was question of
new neurologic deficits although the original head CT showed no
evidence of stroke. The stroke may have been too early to detect
leaving diagnosis of either a new cerebrovascular accident , a
manifestation of a seizure , or a conversion reaction secondary to
her borderline personality. Her primary deficit remained the
slowing of speech without actual slurring of speech and without any
deficits in understanding or expression. A lumbar puncture was
done on the second day of hospitalization with a mildly elevated
protein in the sixties and a glucose in the 120 range. Cell count
was low not consistent with infection. A cardiac echo was also
done which showed normal left ventricular function without any
segmantal wall motion abnormalities , there was a question of left
ventricular hypertrophy , and carotid dopplers were done which
showed no significant disease in the internal carotid arteries ,
however , there was a mild left internal carotid artery plaque.
Patient&apos;s neurologic status remained stable during her
hospitalization. She was started on Aspirin on admission. After
much discussion with NMH Neurology as well as with Dr. Talboti , it
was felt that the patient could be followed as an out-patient. It
is recommended that the patient have Neurology follow-up next week ,
had a repeat CT of the head done to see whether ther is a new
infarct , and also an EEG was recommended by the Neurology
Consultation Servicer here for a question of seizures. Patient
will have home Occupational , Physical , and Speech Therapy provided
through Dishmution .  Another issue was hypercalcemia. Patient had an
elevated calcium on admission. Patient was guaiac negative without
any mass lesions. Patient&apos;s chest X-Ray was also read as clear
without any masses. Patient did have a cursory breast examination
without any evidence of a breast mass and has had mammograms in the
past without any evidence of malignancy. The etiology of the
elevated calcium was unclear although leading diagnoses include
primary hyperparathyroidism , prolonged immobilization , or lying in
bed with some leeching of calcium versus a possible malignancy.
Patient should have her calcium followed as an out-patient. She
did have a PTH level drawn during this admission , the results were
not back at the time of discharge , however , this level should be
checked upon her next visit. Patient is now ready for discharge
home.

2. HYPERTENSION.
3. DIABETES.
4. SARCOIDOSIS.
5. LEFT BREAST CANCER.
6. STATUS POST LUMPECTOMY.

10. DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS.
11. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA.
12. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
13. STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONS X 2.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old woman
with a history of breast cancer and
cardiomyopathy , secondary to Adriamycin , as well as other medical
problems , with left hip pain that has been a chronic issue and
which prompted her to present to Onver Hospital
Emergency Department on January , 2000. In the Emergency
Department , the patient became progressively lethargic and an
arterial blood gas there revealed hypoventilation , presumed
secondary to obesity and the patient&apos;s congestive heart failure.
Blood sugar in the Emergency Department was found to be 46 and the
patient was given D50 , but eventually required a D10 drip to
maintain her sugars. The patient was also placed on BIPAP to
maintain O2 saturations. It seemed that the combination of
congestive heart failure and poor baseline respiration , secondary
to body habitus , led to this acute worsening. The patient was
stabilized in the Emergency Department and sent to the floor on
BIPAP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history included
Adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy ,
hypertension , diabetes , sarcoid left breast cancer ,
hypercholesterolemia , deep venous thromboses , OSA , and coronary
artery disease , status post myocardial infarctions x 2.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient
was on Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Dulcolax 5-10 mg p.o. q. day p.r.n. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin DM
10 ml q. 4 hours p.r.n. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.i.d. , insulin NPH
30 mg subcutaneously b.i.d. , Zestril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Maalox ,
Milk and Magnesia , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. , Senna
tablets p.r.n. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day , Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
oxycontin 10 mg p.o. q. 12 hours , oxycodone 5-10 mg q. 6 hours
p.r.n. pain , and Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s social history revealed that she
lives alone with family help for daily chores.
The patient denied a history of tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination revealed the patient to
be an obese woman with vital signs revealing
temperature 96 , pulse 93 , blood pressure 115/60 , respiratory rate
24 , and saturations 78% on 1.5 liters of oxygen , with 97% on 4
liters of oxygen. HEENT examination showed no jugular venous
distention. The neck was thick. There was no lymphadenopathy and
no carotid bruits. Extraocular movements were intact. The pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. Cardiovascular
examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur , rub ,
or gallop. The lungs showed good breath sounds bilaterally , and
few crackles in both bases anteriorly. The abdomen was
non-distended and non-tender , obese , firm , and with hypoactive
bowel sounds. The extremities showed generalized anasarca.
Neurological examination showed the patient to be alert and
responsive at the time of examination. Cranial nerves II-XII were
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed sodium 140 ,
potassium 5.7 , chloride 99 , bicarb 34 , BUN 32 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 40 , white count 8.2 , hematocrit 39.3 ,
platelets 241 , ALT 32 , AST 65 , LDH 717 , CK 436 , with an MB fraction
of 5.4 , troponin I 0.22 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.1 ,
alkaline phosphatase 381 , digoxin 1.8 , calcium 9.4 , and albumin
4.1. Urine tox screen was negative. An INR was 2.5 , PTT 32.0 , and
D-dimer greater than 1000. Arterial blood gas before BIPAP showed
pH 7.41 , pCO2 63 , and pO2 66 on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula. A portable chest x-ray showed moderate to severe
pulmonary edema , bilateral hilar fullness , right greater than left ,
and cardiomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound was negative for ascites.
A KUB showed free air , non-specific bowel gas pattern , and no
obstruction. A urinalysis showed no protein , 2+ blood , 5-10 red
blood cells , and 1+ squamous epithelial cells. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm in the 80s , low voltage , with no change
from previous studies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit
for diuresis and continued BIPAP. However , the
patient did not tolerate BIPAP , but diuresed well , in fact , too
well , to intravenous boluses of Lasix , with urine output of 7
liters negative in one day , on May , followed by ventilatory
failure on May , with bicarb greater than assay. The patient
was transferred to the CCU for worsening respiratory acidosis and
not tolerating BIPAP. The patient was intubated at that time. The
patient began spiking temperatures on May , as well , and was
started on a regimen of levofloxacin and clindamycin on September
for the question of aspiration pneumonia. On May , a
Swan-Ganz catheter was floated with pulmonary capillary wedge
pressures of 25 and the patient was started on afterload reduction
with Isordil , hydralazine , and Diamox for metabolic alkalosis ,
which was thought to be contributing to her worsening respiratory
acidosis. On July , ceftazidime was started for Pseudomonas ,
which was found in the patient&apos;s sputum. Over the next several
days , the patient had an increased peak requirement to oxygenate
satisfactorily. On November , vancomycin was started for coag
negative Staph , which was cultured from an arterial line , and
levofloxacin was discontinued. On May , the antibiotics were
changed per recommendation of the Infectious Disease consultation
to ceftazidime and Flagyl for Pseudomonas in the sputum culture ,
and the question of C. diff. Vancomycin and clindamycin were
discontinued at that time. On February , amikacin was added for
double coverage for advanced associated pneumonia with Pseudomonas.
Subsequently , the patient slowly improved and it became easier to
oxygenate her , with a decreasing fever curve. A chest CT scan on
January , was consistent with bilateral pneumonia , as well. On
January , the patient was taken off the vent to a trach collar ,
following her tracheostomy and PEG procedure , which she tolerated
well on May .
Other issues in the patient&apos;s hospitalization have included
hypernatremia , thought secondary to the patient&apos;s receiving large
amounts of Lasix and having no access to free water. This was
treated with free water boluses. The patient also had prerenal
azotemia , which was improving at the time of discharge , as well as
coronary artery disease , which was not an issue , and fluid
overload , secondary to cardiomyopathy , which was much improved.
The patient&apos;s course was also complicated by acute renal failure ,
with creatinines rising as high as 2.6 before falling to 1.5 on the
day prior to discharge. The patient&apos;s chest CT scan also showed
significant lymphadenopathy , which was noted prior , and was thought
to be secondary to sarcoid , which was recurrent CA , at this point ,
given that there was no biopsy data. Also , a transthoracic
echocardiogram showed a thickened mitral valve , which may be
unchanged from prior studies , and the clinical suspicion for
endocarditis was fairly low. However , if further positive blood
cultures should arise , this might require further work-up. The
patient&apos;s course was also complicated by anemia , which has required
several blood transfusions while the has been here. The patient
has had several episodes of bleeding and oozing from various
procedure sites , as well as some guaiac positive stool. The
patient&apos;s reticulocyte was found to be 4.9% , while the hematocrit
at that point , on February , was 25.7%. Given her reticulocyte
index of 1.40 , which was inappropriately low , the patient was ,
therefore , started on erythropoietin , as well as iron
supplementation. The patient was also supplemented with tube
feeds , as well as Promod protein supplements , during the course of
her admission. In terms of the patient&apos;s endocrine issues , the
patient was treated with insulin , including varying doses of
regular insulin , NPH , and subcutaneously , as well as insulin drips
at times. While in the hospital , Physical Therapy began to see the
patient prior to discharge and the patient was able to transfer
from bed to chair with assistance.
While in the hospital , the patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG
procedure on May , 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Diamox 250 mg per G-tube b.i.d. ,

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient was
in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was to be transferred to the Pulmonary
Rehabilitation program at the U Of .
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up care should include monitoring the patient&apos;s
anticoagulation with checking heparin factor 10A levels
for her Lovenox after the third dose on May .  The patient
may also be transitioned to Coumadin once a satisfactory
anticoagulation with Lovenox has been achieved. The patient should
also follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Ronnie G Sheldon at Park as soon as possible while at Park Cean Hamppo or
after she is discharged from there.

Imp: Hypoglycemia most likely from impair renal clearance of
glyburide. Possibly addition of colchinine/increased furosemide made this
worse.
Hospital Course:
1. Hypoglycemia - Held glyburide and treated with low dose D10 drip.
Finger sticks were checked every q4 hours and FSBS increased to 150s.
Patient was instructed to eat a normal diet and check her sugars
every 4 hours and when they remain &gt;100 and near 200s , she may start
glipizide. Note: pt has a possible allergy to sulfa which manifest as a
rash after taking an ?allergy medicine. Unlikely to have rash as tolerates
lasix ( sulfa containing ). Will have pt monitor for rash and call if has
any difficulties/prolonged hypoglycemia. VNA services to check in on
patient over the weekend.
2. Gout - pt reports symptoms are much improved. No concern for joint
infection based on exam. Will continue colchicine at renal dose and use
narcotics for prn relief.
3. HTN - cont home meds of ASA , lasix , statin , hyzaar , atenolol , norvasc
4. CRI - stable , creatinine remained at 1.4 and bBUN improved from 73 to
64 with IVFs.
5. CHF - Cont lasix at 80 as per Dr. Rager ( outpt cardiologist ). Instruct
pt to weigh herself daily.
6. GERD - cont PPI , no issues
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Check your blood sugar every 4-6 hours until it remains greater than 100.
After it is stable with blood sugars around 200 you may begin glipizide.
If you develop a rash or persistant hypoglycemia , call Dr. Batalona or
go to the ED.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable

Discharge Date: 3/26/2002
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left great toe infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old man with
diabetes and hypertension well known
to Dr. Sawdey after multiple peripheral bypasses and amputations
who presents with a left great toe infection after transfer from an
outside hospital where he was treated for two weeks of a Strep B
sepsis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , coronary artery disease ,
status post coronary artery bypass grafting
in September of 2001 , peripheral vascular disease , chronic renal
insufficiency , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , anxiety and
depression.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right metatarsal amputation of the second ,
third and fifth ties , step-wise , with a
split thickness skin graft in September of 2001 to the debridement site ,
left second fifth toe TMA , step-wise , in 2001 with split thickness
skin graft and debridement of sites in September of 2001 , left
femoral popliteal with Dacron in April of 2001 , right femoral to
dorsalis pedis with non-reversed saphenous vein graft in September of
2001 and a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 in September of 2001.
STUDIES: In the past , the patient had an echocardiogram in September of
2001 that showed a normal left ventricular function and a
questionable small atrial septal defect.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Axid 150 mg p.o. q. day , Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q. day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , albuterol and Atrovent , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day ,
Percocet , multivitamin , zinc , vitamin C , Colace , ampicillin 1 gram
q.8h. for seven days , NPH 30 units q. AM and 20 units q. PM.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.2 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 160/70. LUNGS: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft and non-tender.
EXTREMITIES: Pulses palpable in the femoral , carotid and radial
pulses , right dorsalis pedis graft pulse was 2+ palpable with 1+
dorsalis pedis dopplerable pulses on the left. The great toe had a
medial wet ulcer as well as a right plantar ulcer that was dry with
an eschar of about 2 cm. The left leg had 2+ pitting edema with
increased asymmetry to the knee and the left great toe showed some
fibrinous exudate without any pus.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on ampicillin ,
levofloxacin and Flagyl. He was planned to go
the operating room the next day for a left great toe debridement.
Preoperatively , he was seen by Cardiology who recommended that we
double his dose of simvastatin to 20 mg and increase the Lopressor
to 25 mg q.i.d. and otherwise , he was cleared for surgery. On
July , 2002 , the patient was taken to the operating room for a
left foot debridement and left great toe amputation. This was done
under spinal anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and on postoperative day number one , he had a VAC sponge placed to
the wound. He tolerated having the VAC sponge on and was able to
ambulate heel weight bearing only with the VAC sponge.
Cardiology followed the patient and recommended that we change him
to atenolol and add Tricor as an anticholesterol drug.
The Diabetes Management Service was also consulted to help with the
patient&apos;s fingersticks and we increased his NPH as well as added
regular insulin in the AM and PM.
On March , 2002 , the VAC sponge was taken down and wet to dry
dressing was placed over it. At this time , it was felt that the
wound was not ready for a skin graft yet and the plan was to
discharge him to rehabilitation for wet to dry dressing changes
until the wound was ready for skin grafts.
Thus , the patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition to continue wet to dry dressing changes as well as to
continue a course of vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl for two
more weeks.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol 50
mg p.o. q. day , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , insulin NPH human 45 units q. AM , 35 units q.h.s. , insulin
regular sliding scale 10 units q. AM and 6 units pre-dinner ,
albuterol and Atrovent , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , Flagyl 500 mg
p.o. t.i.d. x 14 days , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
pain , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , multivitamin therapeutic one
tablet p.o. q. day , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , levofloxacin 500
mg p.o. q. day x 14 days , Tricor 200 mg p.o. q.h.s. , vancomycin 1
gram intravenously q.18h. x 14 days.
FOLLOW UP: The patient is to follow up with Dr. Blust and call
his office for an appointment. The patient will also
follow up with his primary care physician in one to two weeks.

PRINCIPAL PROBLEM: Vascular insufficiency.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Diabetes mellitus , known vascular disease ,
incontinence , recurrent UTIs , hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 89-year-old woman with
insulin dependent diabetes , coronary
artery disease , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , and
ejection fraction of 28% who had a left fem-peroneal bypass in the
past presented with on-going left toe pain admitted for left toe
vascular insufficiency and cellulitis refractory to treatment for
two months. The patient reported having her podiatrist clip her
nails about two months ago which is when her pain in her foot
started. She denies any fever , chills , cough , shortness of breath ,
nausea , or vomiting. At home she was able to ambulate , but had
significant pain localizing to her left foot and toe. She was
recently admitted here on July for the same
complaint treated with IV levofloxacin and clindamycin for five
days and then went home on ten days of dicloxacillin , then Keflex.
She comes back on the April with the same pain
and infection in her left foot. On admission she was afebrile with
mild tachycardia and stable blood pressure. Exam was notable for a
soft systolic ejection murmur at the base , non-palpable pulses in
her left lower extremity. Left foot was cool. There was swelling
over the dorsum of her left foot to the ankle. There was a
superficial ulcer along the medial aspect of the nail bed without
purulence. She had normal white blood cell count and negative
blood cultures taken here.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Status post CVA , status post carotid
endarterectomy , status post fem-peroneal
bypass in 1997 , diabetes , hypertension , inflammatory bowel disease ,
congestive heart failure with an EF of 28 to 30% , depression ,
recurrent UTIs , coronary artery disease , status post MI , non-Q wave
MI , cataracts , stress incontinence.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include lactulose , Zocor , Metamucil ,
Paxil , Cozaar , Neurontin , Metformin ,
Lantus.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for recurrent vascular
insufficiency with superimposed cellulitis likely
due to her poor lower extremity perfusion from her peripheral
vascular disease. An MRI was obtained which was concerning for
early osteomyelitis and there was concern that her bypass graft in
her left leg was not patent. She had angiography of the left leg
vessels and proceeded to get stenting of the left common iliac and
external iliac vessels without complication on May .  Also
during her hospitalization she had elevated LFTs which were
attributed to a three gram dose of Unasyn that she received in the
Emergency Room. The Unasyn was changed to IV clindamycin and levo ,
and a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a calcified
gallbladder wall and no obstruction , and her LFTs then began to
normalize. Her cardiac status remained stable throughout her
admission and she is to be treated with Plavix 75 mg for 30 days
after the stenting of her iliac vessels. A PICC line was placed on
the day of discharge for on-going IV antibiotics

Discharge Date: 3/10/2006
ATTENDING: VERDUGO , MAX ARTHUR MD
SERVICE: Medicine.
Mr. Lyn was admitted with hypoxia and hypotension initially in
the MICU. He is a 66-year-old male with coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , type 2 diabetes , hyperlipidemia , ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , and history of CVAs. He was
recently admitted in October 2006 for a right middle lobe
pneumonia , spent 2 days in the hospital. He felt fine since then
with some waxing and waning. However , he presented with
increased cough , rigor&apos;s , difficulty walking and speaking , and a
fever to 101. He was found at home to be short of breath. He
had blue lips , hands per his family. EMS was called and found
that he had an O2 saturation of 80%; it increased to 97% on 100%
nonrebreather. EKG on admission showed new left bundle-branch
block , but cath lab declined to intervene because he was
tachycardic at that time. It was felt to be secondary to demand.
He was hypotensive in the ED requiring fluids. Subclavian line
was placed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD. He has 3-vessel coronary artery
disease , status post CABG x1 in 1999 , SVG to RCA. He had an
NSTEMI in 1/22 with Cypher stent to 70% proximal LAD and Pixel
stent to 70% ostial D1. He had an NSTEMI in October 2004 with a
new Cypher to D1 instent restenosis and diffuse left circ disease
was seen as well. He has hypertension , also type 2 diabetes , on
oral agents. He has hyperlipidemia. He has mitral valve status
post St. Jude 33-mm valve in 1999. He has ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35%. He has had multiple CVAs. He
is on treatment dose of Lovenox after failure of Coumadin and
prophylactic dose of Lovenox. He had a subdural hematoma in the
setting of Coumadin , status post bur-hole drainage in 1999. He
has seizure disorder history. He also has a history of carotid
stenosis , status post a left CEA in 2002. He has GERD and
history of sacral decubitus ulcer.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 325 daily , Toprol 200 daily ,
lisinopril 20 daily , Lovenox 80 b.i.d. , fenofibrate 145 daily ,
Lipitor 40 daily , glipizide 10 b.i.d. , Keppra 500 b.i.d. ,
Benadryl 25 b.i.d. as needed for itching , multivitamin , iron
sulfate 325 daily , trazodone 50 daily , Zantac 150 twice daily ,
and miconazole topical daily.
He has an allergy to Dilantin which causes a desquamating rash.
On admission to the MICU , his temperature was 96.7 , heart rate
75 , BP 98/54 , breathing at 14 , satting 97% on 4 L. He was in no
acute distress. Anicteric. OP was clear. Pulmonary exam
revealed crackles , decreased breath sounds at the bases , no
wheezes. He had a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart
sounds , mechanical S1. His JVP was from the jaw. He had
positive bowel sounds , obese , soft , nontender abdomen. His legs
were warm and dry with no rashes. He was awake but not
cooperative. He has a baseline left-sided facial droop , left
forearm flexion , moving all 4 extremities.
His admission chest x-ray showed a diffuse bilateral airspace
disease , right greater than left , no effusion , consistent with
multilobar pneumonia versus pulmonary edema. Echo in September 2005
showed an LVEF of 35% with a kinesis of septum , inferior wall ,
apical lateral segment and mechanical mitral valve. His EKG in
the MICU showed sinus at a rate of 76. When his rate was faster ,
he showed a left bundle-branch block.
COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. ID: There was a question of multilobar pneumonia based on
his recent admission for pneumonia and the appearance of his
chest x-ray. He was initially on empiric ceftriaxone ,
azithromycin , and vancomycin in the MICU. We discontinued the
vancomycin. Blood cultures were clear. He weaned from oxygen ,
and his chest x-ray cleared within 1 to 2 days. So , it was felt
that he had more of the component of CHF exacerbation. He
completed a short 7-day course of azithromycin.
2. Cardiovascular:
I. Ischemia: He has extensive CAD and showed an elevated CK ,
troponin , and a new left bundle branch in the setting of
hypotension. This was felt to be a demand ischemia. His enzymes were
elevated with his troponin remaining elevated at 5 , but the MB had
decreased from 18 to 2 rapidly. The cardiology consultants felt
that this was demand ischemia as the left bundle-branch block was
rate dependent and recommended continued medical management. He
is already on therapeutic-dose Lovenox for his history of CVA.
II. Pump: He initially had hypertension in the unit. This
resolved and he appeared euvolemic on his home dose of 20 mg of
Lasix daily. A repeat echo revealed no changes.
III. Rhythm: As mentioned above , he exhibited a new left
bundle-branch block in the setting of tachycardia but decreased
rate.
3. Heme: Initially had bleeding from his left subclavian site
in the setting of his anticoagulation; it resolved. Spoke with
the vascular wervice who recommended holding one dose of Lovenox when the
line was removed. This was done , and the line was removed
successfully without any bleeding.
4. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. His creatinine
remained at baseline of 1.2 to 1.5.
5. Neuro: He has a history of multiple CVAs. We kept him on
his treatment-dose Lovenox other than being held for 1 dose to
remove the line. He has seizure disorder. He is on Keppra. He
has a history of sundowning and was placed on Zyprexa briefly but
this was weaned.
6. Endo: At home , Mr. Vanzie was on oral medications. He was
started on Lantus and lispro and we decided to send him on Lantus
as well as some a.c. NovoLog as well.
Mr. Sindel was discharged home with services with followup
appointments with Dr. Willie Saale on 3/30/2006 at 1330 hours ,
Dr. Demaine on 5/11/2006 at 1550 hours , and with Dr.
Malmanger on 11/8/2006 at 1400 hours.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours as needed
for headache , aspirin 325 mg daily , Dulcolax 10 mg daily , Colace

**********************
Hospital Course by Problem:
88 yo with recent STEMI , managed medically , here with CHF
exacerbation in setting non med adherence and zoster.Patient is non
adherent to meds given recent increase in number of total meds since STEMIi.
olypharmacy seems to have overwhelmed the patient , so efforts were made to
reduced his med list to just &quot;essential meds&quot; to improve adherence. Patient
remains on TID and BID dosed HTNive meds which is not ideal , but we will
defer adjustment of his cardiac regimen to his cardiologist. For now , iron ,
nexium , probenecid , ergocalcitriol , nephrocaps have been taken off the emd
list , but can be added back in if seen fit.
1 ) CV:
ISCHEMIA: Recent STEMI , not stented given potential contrast load
in setting of CRI ( no HD ). On this admission , no chest pain , some TWI in
chest leads , but cardiac enzymes negative. Continue home doses ASA , Zocor.
PUMP: CHF exacerbation: Received 60mg Lasix IV x1 ,
diuresed well with resolution of pulm edema , dyspnea. Will discharge on
home regimen Lasix 40mg PO BID QDay for next three days , then back to prior
dose of 80 mg po qd alternating with 40 mg po qd.
Satting 95% on RA at discharge.
Had brief episode of bradycardia to 40 , but no symptoms or EKG changes.
Will keep on high Labetalol dose given severe CAD without stent , only
medical management. Continue amlodipine , Hydralazine for HTN
RHYTHM: no active issues besides asymptomatic bradycardia.
3 ) Zoster ( shingles ): Began Valacyclovir , will dischage with 6 more days
of this med. Calamine for pruritis offered some relief.
4 ) Anemia: secondary to renal failure. cont weekly epo injections and iron
supplements
5 ) DM: diet controlled.
6 ) Med noncompliance: arranged for VNA to help with med scheduling.
7 ) CRI: high BUN/CR , but same as previous admission. Metabolic
acidosis from inability to excrete H+. Refused HD. Continue Phoslo ,
Kaexylate.
8 ) ANEMIA: most likely secondary to renal failure. Will continue weekly
epo shots as needed
9 ) RHEUM: hold probenecid for gout given CRI
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take all meds daily

Discharge Date: 2/5/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raffo is a 59-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post small non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in
October of 2000 and also status post cardiac catheterization with 2
vessel disease , small left PICA cerebrovascular accident ,
congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in October
revealing an ejection fraction of 30%. Also diabetes mellitus type
II complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy.
History of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well who
presented to Dr. Bouie clinic on May , 2001 with
progressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth and
weight gain over the past few months.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renal
insufficiency with the last creatinine in
January of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30% in October of 2000 , coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction , October 2000 question f silent myocardial
infarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day ,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL
50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300
mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n..
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 ,
primary care physician of 18. The patient appeared
to be in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure approximately
13 cm water. LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. CARDIAC:
Tachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. ABDOMEN: Positive ,
normal active bowel sounds. Obese , distended and nontender.
EXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edema
bilaterally to the knees.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notes
of thyroid dysfunction , his history was
consistent with fluid overload. His jugular venous pressure was
elevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees without
significant rales on chest exam. He was aggressively diuresed with
doses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. IV as well as Zaroxolyn. Weight on
admission was 135 kilograms and on discharge he was down to 132
kilograms. A repeat echocardiogram at Ethool Hospital
showed an ejection fraction of 30-35 , left ventricular dimensions
of 47 mm , 1 plus mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis as
well as moderate right ventricular dysfunction. Abdominal
ultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomen
and right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed there
was no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due to
adipose tissue. Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renal
failure and oliguria. Diuresis was held from May , 2001.
Right heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildly
elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevated
right ventricular pressures. Dopamine was started on June ,
2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was then
weaned off of that on July , 2001. His Lasix was stopped on
July , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of discharge
with stable blood pressure. He remained stable with no dyspnea at
rest and is symptom free at the time of discharge.
2. Renal: His basic chronic renal insufficiency is likely
secondary to poor diabetic control with a creatinine of 2.5 on October , 2001 , 3.3 at the time of admission. Acute renal failure with
increasing creatinine of 6 after aggressive diuresis with a mean of
0.8 percent. Renal function improved with creatinine of 4.1 on
July , 2001 with autodiuresis. The renal service was
consulted to comment on the nature of the patient&apos;s renal
insufficiency and acute renal failure as well as to assist in the
use of vasodilators.

ATTENDING: KEGLER , OLEN ESTEBAN MD
DATE OF DISCHARGE:
Unknown.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Gangrenous fourth right toe with necrotic right great toe ulcer
and right forefoot cellulitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Maixner is a 57-year-old male with a history of a poor medical
follow up smoking and untreated diabetes mellitus who first noted
blisters on the tip of his right fourth toe and under medial
right great toe from ill-fitting tissues approximately a year
prior to his admission. Both ulcers have been nonhealing and
cyclically formed dark eschars and superficial scabs which have
been treated with lotion as recommended by his podiatrist. Five
to six months ago , he traveled to Oonperfin Rd and spend some time in
hot tubs and Jacuzzi&apos;s but his ulcers continued to form eschars
without healing completely and also episodically became
erythematous and painful with involvement of the forefoot. Each
episode usually resolved with foot elevation and rest. On
8/29/05 , after long walks , he noticed that the right fourth toe
turned to a dark purple color , was malodorous. He had pain with
weightbearing and was obliged to heel walk. Over the next
several days , the forefoot became erythematosus and swollen as
well. He denied any fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , cough ,
headache , although he had an episode of malaise and chills that
lasted three days several weeks prior to his admission. His
appetite had been stable. He had not had any recent weight
change. Functionally , he was doing well. Ambulation was limited
only by foot pain. He denied claudication , chest pressure ,
dyspnea on exertion. He would sleep on one pillow at night with
head flat. He denied lightheadedness or any presyncopal
episodes. On 5/30/05 , he presented to H Medical Center for
workup of his painful forefoot and toe ulcers. He was afebrile
with vital signs stable. His right fourth toe was described as
blackened with clear demarcation at the metatarsal junction , and
eschar was noted on the right first toe. He is white blood cell
count at that stage was 12.7. Plain films were notable for
suspicious swelling about the fourth toe with evidence of gas
noted within the soft tissues of the medial aspect of the fourth
toe in the proximal interphalangeal joint. He went on to have
ABIs that were 0.32 on the right side and 0.43 on the left side
and PVRs were normal at 5 level only. He also underwent a
cardiac workup that was notable for SPECT/MIBI that showed a
reversible defect involving the basal , mid and apical segments of
the anterior wall consistent with myocardial ischemia. An echo
showed an ejection fraction of 45% and possible septal
hypokinesis. Given the positive stress test and a positive need
for cardiac cath , he was transferred to T.bafnashstin Hospital for further management. He did not feel that would have
change in appearance since 1/25 although the pain had increasing
intensity. He denied any sensory or motor deficits , but he had
pain whenever he moved his toes or put any weight.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Rheumatoid arthritis since 1980s that was untreated , type II
diabetes mellitus since 1990s that was untreated , multiple bony
injuries to his right foot , and a football accident as a
teenager.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Bilateral mastoidectomies in 1970s and 1980s , status post penile
surgery at childhood , status post sebaceous cyst removal in 2004.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
None.
ALLERGIES:
NKDA.
SOCIAL HISTORY:

until 1993 but had been sober attending AA since then. Prior
heroin , speed and barbiturate abuse , with history of cocaine ,
tranquilizers , marijuana use; has been clean since 1993. He used
to work for a moving company , no disability and lives alone in
Tall All He is single and has no children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , temperature 99.6 , heart rate 72 , blood pressure
150/86 , respiratory rate 16 , oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
General appearance: Elderly looking gentleman in no apparent
distress with bilateral hearing aids. HEENT: No JVP , no carotid
bruits. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Birthmark on right upper back.
Abdomen: Mildly distended , soft , nontender , no pulsatile masses.
Bilateral lower extremity skin hallus with normal color and
temperature down to feet. Right forefoot was erythematous and
edematous and warm with no fluctuance or crepitus. His plantar
surface was tender to palpation immediately beneath the fourth
metatarsal. His right fourth toe was necrotic and malodorous
with no purulent discharge. His anteromedial aspect of his right
great toe had a 0.5 cm round ulcer with dark eschar center and
desiccated edges with mild erythema and induration around it.
Dorsiflexion was 5/5 and plantar flexion 4-/5 and limited by
pain. He had full strength on the left side , normal sensation
throughout both feet. Pulses: Right carotid 2+ femoral
dopplerable , DP dopplerable , PT dopplerable. Left carotid 2+
femoral , 1+ DP , none PT dopplerable. Bedside ABIs: Right side
0.43 , left side 0.51. He was admitted with diagnosis of a
multilevel arterial insufficiency bilaterally and need for fourth
toe amputation impossible for debridement followed by angio for
possible revascularization.
PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS:
7/23/05: Attending surgeon , Leif Pinke , M.D. Open
amputation of right fourth toe.
8/17/05: Attending surgeon , Yong Weinrich , M.D. Coronary
artery bypass grafting x4 with saphenous vein graft to acute
marginal distal PDA , left internal mammary artery to the LAD , Y
left radial artery from LIMA to the ramus intermedius to the
posterior left ventricular branch of the circumflex.
7/23/05: Left to right femoral to femoral artery bypass using
an 8 mm Dacron graft.
9/26/05: Attending surgeon , Tyree Denten , M.D. Right
femoropopliteal bypass grafting and amputation of the right third
and fifth toe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Bessard underwent amputation of his fourth toe on the right
side after his admission. He tolerated his procedure well. A
few days later , he underwent the previously mentioned coronary
artery bypass grafting; please refer to the previously dictated
summary , dictation ID 8626234 for details. After his coronary
bypass grafting , he underwent a femoral-femoral bypass grafting
with debridement of his right toe amputations site. After his
procedure , he had a weak dorsal pedis , a questionable posterior
tibial and normal popliteal signal on Doppler but none of his
pulses were palpable. His femoral-femoral graft was easily
palpable on his abdomen. Due to his poor vascularization of his
right lower extremity , he underwent a femoropopliteal bypass
grafting on the right with a nonreversed saphenous vein grafting
from the ipsilateral leg and amputation of his right and fifth
toe and closure of his lateral foot. He tolerated this procedure
well. The rest of his hospital course was complicated by a
worsening of the left lower extremity perfusion. His left foot
was slightly cooler than his right and his Doppler signals
fainted. An initial mottle appearance of his left lower
extremity improved with time. On 4/8 , his wounds were dry ,
clean and intact. He had a palpable femoral-femoral graft and
dopplerable left PT and DP pulses with monophasic signal. Both
his PT and DP on the right are dopplerable as well with biphasic
signal. The same day , his Foley catheter was removed and he
started mobilizing with heel weightbearing on the right and with
help of physical therapy and the nursing personnel he is
currently actively screened for rehabilitation.
His discharge would be complete. Will await this??_____??.

her PTM internal capsule. He EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 102
normal axis , normal intervals , diffuse T wave inversions in 1 , 2 , 3
AVF , V2 to V6. Her chest x-ray showed no active process.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was found to have non ST elevation
MRI and there was possible cause of her syncope
and was treated conservatively with medical management.
Cardiovascular - ischemia , ST elevation , myocardial infarction.

bandemia of an unclear cause. Her workup was negative. Her UA
and chest x-ray were negative. She had no fevers. Her white blood
cell count ultimately declined to normal.
Renal - the patient was most likely dehydrated initially and was
given fluids until she had good urine output. Her IV fluids
ultimately discontinued. Renal ultrasound was negative for
hydronephrosis or obstruction.
Neuro - Although the patient&apos;s CT was negative for acute stroke and
positive for possible infarct the patient declined MRI of the brain
to workup for a possible TIA.
PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE: The patient is somewhat debilitated
following her hospitalization , requires
physical therapy to regain her ability to perform activities of
daily living. Additionally the patient should follow with
Gynecology , is scheduled for a workup for her incontinence which
may also include an issue of uterine prolapse.

the right lower extremity.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post non-ST
segment elevation MI in August 2005 , s/p stenting
in August 2005 , most recent cath in October 2006. Peripheral
vascular disease , renal transplant for type 1 diabetes ,
living-related renal transplant in 1991 status post rejection and
failure in January 2005 , now end-stage renal disease on

has had diabetes mellitus type 1 since age 6. He also has a
history of hypertension , hypothyroidism , PEA arrest in October
2006 in the setting of hypercalcemia , peripheral neuropathy , and
right lower extremity open reduction and internal fixation in
October 2006 for nonunion of a tibial fracture.

enalapril 20 mg daily , gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d. , Dilaudid p.r.n.
pain , NPH 30 in the morning and 32 in the p.m. , levothyroxine 50
mcg daily , prednisone 10 mg q.a.m. , Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d. ,
Imdur 60 mg daily , Lipitor 80 mg daily , Nephrocaps one daily ,
Plavix 75 mg daily , Caltrate plus vitamin D one tab nightly ,
sevelamer 800 mg b.i.d. , omeprazole 20 mg daily , NovoLog sliding
scale as per patient , and Toprol 50 mg daily.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin which causes a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife. Former smoker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon presentation , the patient&apos;s vital
signs 97.7 , 73 , 135/68 , 12 , and 97% on 2 L. Generally , he is in no
apparent distress , alert and oriented x3. Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border. No S3 or S4. Lungs are clear to
auscultation anteriorly. His abdomen is nontender and
nondistended. The patient is obese. The patient&apos;s extremities
show 1+ peripheral edema , right greater than left. Right lower
extremity is bandaged. He has 1+ DPs bilaterally.
Neurologically , he is grossly intact.
His EKG upon presentation showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 ,
normal axis , normal intervals , no ST- or T-wave changes but
isolated T-wave inversions in leads III , which are new from
7/14/2006 with peak T waves , QRS of normal duration. His K at
that time was 6.7. Creatinine was 6.1. His white count on
10/14/2006 was 13.1 , 43.9 , and 309 , 000 , to complete a CBC. INR
was 1.
The impression at the time of presentation was a 53-year-old
male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease status post recent revascularization in October of 2006 ,
peripheral vascular disease , renal transplant status post
failure , now on hemodialysis , diabetes , hypertension , and
hypothyroidism who presented with a left hip fracture and worsening of a
previous R distal tib/fib fx.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the orthopedic surgery
service and a preoperative evaluation was begun. On hospital day three ,
he suffered a non-ST segment elevation MI requiring urgent cardiac
catheterization. His EF at that time was noted to be 65%. Left heart
catheterization revealed a single-vessel coronary artery disease involving his
left circumflex with evidence of restenosis , and an angioplasty was
performed. The patient was transferred back to the floor hemodynamically
stable. He continued to undergo dialysis on his Tuesday , Thursday ,
Saturday schedule from the day of his catheterization until 10/16/2006 when he
was taken to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation of
his left intertrochanteric hip fracture. For a complete summary ,
please refer to the operative note. His right tibial injury was
managed conservatively initially with splinting. On 10/20/2006 ,
the patient returned to the operating room where he underwent a
revision of his fixation of his right lower extremity with
removal of deep hardware and intramedullary rodding of his distal
tibia fracture. A VAC was placed across the lower part of the
incision. On 9/17/2006 , the VAC was changed on the floor and
placed on suction and was noted to be oozing steadily with a
eventual EBL of about 1 L within several hours. His systolic blood
pressures also droped into the 80s to 90s along with symptoms of
diaphoresis. Mr. Legacy was subsequently transferred to the 7D ICU for
management of significant bleeding from his open wound , relative tachycardia ,
hypotension , and diaphoresis , concerning for hemorrhage shock.
The patient at that time was on Plavix , aspirin , and Lovenox , and
it was thought that this combination certainly led to his oozing
during the VAC change. The patient was transfused several units
of blood after hematocrit dropped from 28 to 19 on the day of
transfer. The patient was transferred back to the floor in
stable condition within several days. The patient continued to receive
dialysis Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday during this time as the
orthopedic surgery service continued wet-to-dry dressings of his
right lower extremity wound , which was open inferiorly. On
1/6/2006 , the Aland Memorial Cardiology Service was again
consulted regarding the safety of discontinuing the patient&apos;s
Plavix , aspirin , and/or Lovenox prior to taking the patient back
to the operating room. The service determined that his Plavix
could be stopped safely prior to surgery but should be started
postoperatively. The patient was continued with daily wet-to-dry
dressings until 10/10/2006 when he was taken back to the
operating room for medialization of his right ankle. His Plavix
had been discontinued on 6/18/2006 and was restarted on
postoperative day one. The patient continued to receive dialysis
during this time , which he tolerated well. His subcutaneous
heparin was restarted on 9/25/2006 .  However , the patient began
to ooze from his injection sites and his right lower extremity
wound and the subcutaneous heparin was subsequently discontinued.
Thus , the patient is maintained at the current time on aspirin
and Plavix.
Currently , by systems:
Neurologic: The patient is receiving 30 mg of methadone q.8h.
for pain as well as Dilaudid 0.2 to 0.4 q.3h. p.r.n. and
oxycodone 20 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. pain. He is alert and oriented
x3 and is neurologically intact with the exception of decreased
sensation in his right lower extremity. Cardiovascularly , he has
been hemodynamically stable although his systolics often in the
90s after dialysis. He is being continued on an aspirin 325 mg
as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg q.i.d. , Imdur 60 mg daily , and
Plavix 75 mg daily. He has prolonged QT ranging from 400 to 500
and his frequent PVCs noted on telemetry. However , he has been
asymptomatic since his episode of hypotension requiring
readmission to the ICU.
Respiratory: The patient has been stable on room air since
transfer from the ICU and denies any pulmonary symptoms. GI , the
patient has had decreased p.o. intake and nutrition consultation
was ordered. Nutrition has been following the patient
recommending frappes and Boost , which the patient has been taking
minimally. The patient has been having bowel movements and his
abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended.
GU: The patient is followed by the renal service for dialysis on
Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday. Currently on PhosLo 667 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Nephrocaps , Caltrate. His sevelamer is
currently held. The patient makes minimal amounts of urine in
addition to his dialysis sessions.
ID: The patient has been maintained on vancomycin 1 g Tuesday ,
Thursday , Saturday after hemodialysis. He has been afebrile for
the past week. His current white count is 8.6. Hematologically ,
as mentioned previously , the patient presented on aspirin and
Plavix and Lovenox was added. However , due to his episode of
bleeding requiring ICU admission , there was concern regarding
over-anticoagulation. However , the three agents were continued
and the patient stabilized. Per the cardiology service , Plavix
was discontinued approximately one week preoperatively and
restarted one day postoperatively. Subcutaneous heparin was
added back to his regimen on postop day two. However , he began
oozing from his injection sites in his right lower extremity and
thus the subcutaneous heparin was discontinued. The patient&apos;s
hematocrit is currently 31.6.
Endocrine wise , the patient has been continued on his home dose
of prednisone which is 10 mg daily , he has also been continued on
NPH and NovoLog which have been titrated per recommendations from
the diabetes service. His wound on the right lower extremity is
granulating appropriately although there are areas of ecchymosis
and skin thickening and darkening around the incision. The
patient is currently receiving b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings of the
right lower extremity. His right hip surgery incisions are
clean , dry , and intact with no signs of infection.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SEVERE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST
PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY
ANGIOPLASTY/STENT PLACEMENT TIMES TWO , LEFT
CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lechman is a 50-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery
disease significant for an 80% mid circumflex , 95% mid right , 70%
distal right , 50% distal left anterior descending coronary artery
lesions with posterobasilar hypokinesis in the setting of a
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction , hypertension times
greater than 30 years , and an elevated cholesterol who was in his
normal state of health until the morning of admission. At that
time , he was performing strenuous work in his bakery and began to
suffer from 4/10 chest pain , &quot;heaviness&quot; , and discomfort. The pain
did not radiate. He denies dizziness , shortness of breath ,
palpitations , and diaphoresis. The patient took one sublingual
nitroglycerin and sat down with resolution of pain in approximately
five minutes. The patient then returned to work. Several hours
later , while again performing strenuous work , the patient suffered
a similar episode of chest pain and heaviness which he rates as a
2/10. The patient sat down and , this time , the pain resolved
without sublingual nitroglycerin in approximately three minutes.
The patient was disconcerted by these multiple events and went to
the Skaggsmiddrish Hospital Emergency Room for further work up. While
sitting comfortably in the Emergency Room at Nantsi Memorial Hospital , the
patient suffered a similar event of chest pain and tightness , which
he reports to be approximately 1.5/10. He took one sublingual
nitroglycerin with resolution of his symptoms in approximately five
minutes. The patient was transferred to Slandchor Hospital Medical Center at that point. One hour later , in Sa Hospital Emergency Room , the patient suffered a similar episode of
chest pain and tightness , this time rated at 1/10 , with resolution
of pain in approximately one minute , not requiring sublingual
nitroglycerin. The patient reported , at that time , that his life
had been very stressful , and that he had been working very hard in
his bakery. Review of symptoms is consistent with above and ,
otherwise , noncontributory.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease diagnosed in 1994
with catheterization performed in April
1994. There was 80% mid circumflex , 70% distal , 95% mid right , 50%
distal left anterior descending occlusions. Posterobasilar
hypokinesia with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. 2.
Hypertension times greater than 30 years. 3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Hepatitis in 1991 , believed to be of a viral type with complete
resolution of symptoms and no sequela. 5. An exercise tolerance
test in February 1996 that showed 2 mm ST segment depression in the
inferior and lateral leads. The exercise tolerance test proceeded
without chest pain.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy in the distant past.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. 2.
Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3. Atenolol
100 mg p.o. q.day. 4. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5. Enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg q.day.
ALLERGIES: Shellfish causes a rash.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had hypertension , grandmother with coronary
artery disease. There is no history of diabetes
mellitus or cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies current tobacco use. He
reports a 40 pack year history , quitting five
years ago. The patient denies alcohol use. The patient lives at
home with wife. They have no children. The patient reports that
he is now on a low cholesterol diet , has lost 100 lb over the last
two years , and was successfully walking four to five miles a day
without chest pain or other symptoms until the day prior to
admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile. His blood
pressure was 132/84 , heart rate 62 , and a
room air saturation of 96%. Generally , Mr. Mcalister was an
alert , well appearing man in no apparent distress. He was eager to
answer our questions. Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat
examination was significant only for exanthema under the right eye.
The patient&apos;s neck was supple with full range of motion and no
lymphadenopathy. There were bilateral carotid bruits. Carotid
pulses were 2+. The patient had jugular venous distention of 6 cm
with the head of the bed elevated at 15 degrees. Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Heart examination was significant for
normal S1 and S2 , and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur that was
heard best at the lower left sternal border , although it was
audible at the right sternal border , left mid axillary line , and
appeared to radiate to the carotids. The abdominal examination was
benign. The patient&apos;s extremities were clear of cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. The patient had 2+ symmetrical pulses
throughout. The patient was guaiac negative by report was normal
tone. Neurologic examination was nonfocal and significant for the
patient being alert and oriented times three , with a motor
examination showing 5/5 strength throughout. Sensory examination
was intact to light touch. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. The
patient had deep tendon reflexes that were 2+ throughout.
LABORATORY DATA: The patient was found to have normal
electrolytes. White count was 6.3 and hematocrit
41.2. CPK obtained at Storgwi Hospital was 148 and serial
CPKs obtained at Scc Side Medical Center were 81 , 114 ,
115 , respectively. No MB fraction was done. At Ins Medical Center , the patient had an EKG taken that was significant for
normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute with intervals of
169/93/402 with no Q waves , no ST changes. This was consistent
with an EKG from September , 1996. An EKG obtained at Han Rutl Medical Center showed normal sinus rhythm at 64 beats per minute
with intervals of 172/100/412 with one PVC captured. However ,
there were no Q waves and no ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was begun on heparin 1 , 000 units per
hour IV after an initial 5 , 000 units IV bolus.
The patient consistently maintained a PTT in the range of 60-80
seconds. The patient underwent a catheterization the day following
admission which demonstrated 80% occlusion of the ramus branch ,
100% occlusion of the left obtuse marginal branch number one , and a
100% occlusion of the patient&apos;s right coronary artery. It was
decided that the patient would be a candidate for both conventional
PTCA to attempt to repair the left circumflex coronary artery.
However , the patient&apos;s severe coronary artery disease lead the
interventional radiologists to consider the patient for a laser
wire type of PTCA in the event that PTCA was not successful. As
the laser wire PTCA was not available for several days , it was
decided to have Mr. Lienhard remain as an inpatient on heparin to
maintain a PTT of 60-80 while awaiting the laser wire guided PTCA.
Three days following admission , while awaiting PTCA , the patient
had one episode of chest pain that he reports resolved in less than
three minutes with one sublingual nitroglycerin tablet. The
patient denied shortness of breath , palpitations , or diaphoresis.
Since that time , the patient remained totally stable with no
further events of chest pain and no EKG changes noted. The patient
was begun on 250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d. two days prior to his
catheterization procedure.
On May , 1996 , five days after admission , the patient
successfully underwent PTCA of his left circumflex artery which had
previously had a 100% stenosis. The patient had two stents placed
in the left circumflex artery , leaving a 0% residual lesion. The
patient tolerated the procedure well , returned to the floor. The
catheterization sheaths were removed six hours after the procedure.
Examination the following morning revealed no further bleeding , no
hematoma , and good pulses distally , as well as a warm and dry left
lower extremity. As the patient tolerated the procedure well and
had no further complications , it was decided that the patient could
be discharged the day following his catheterization , maintained on
250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone
25 mg p.o. q.a.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.day.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Mr. Ruesswick will be discharged in stable
condition following his PTCA from the day
before. The patient will be discharged to home.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Wilburn Ducceschi ,
his outside hospital cardiologist , in one to two weeks.
We suspect that Mr. Danco will be able to return to his normal
activities of daily living without any further disability.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Chemotherapy toxicity , atrial fibrillation , dehydration , colitis ,
liver failure.
ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:
Hypotension , diabetes mellitus , esophagitis , congestive heart
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Linsenmayer is a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer
that was first diagnosed in 1999 , and she is status post
lumpectomy with lymph node dissection and multiple chemotherapy
regimens. She is currently on Xeloda with excellent response;
per Dr. Cagan , her outpatient oncologist , she has virtually no
evidence of metastatic disease on CT. Over the past few months ,
the patient has had chronic problems with nausea and decreased
appetite. This has become especially acute over the past week ,
and as a result , her chemotherapy is now on hold. She has also
had some worsening diarrhea , for which she was prescribed
Imodium , but because of ongoing issues with compliance , it was
felt that she was not taking enough at home. During an
outpatient visit with her cardiologist , her blood pressure was
noted to be 90/50 , so her dose of atenolol and Lasix was
decreased. Of note , the patient is status post a recent
admission to MH for digoxin toxicity , so this medication is now
also on hold. Of note , the patient is not currently on Coumadin
despite a history of atrial fibrillation due to a history of GI
bleeding , possible interactions with her chemotherapy regimen ,
and ongoing issues with medication compliance. The patient was
admitted for rehydration , management of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea ,
and control of her pain and other symptoms.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Nausea/vomiting x several months , diarrhea approximately six
times per day , worsening over the past week with green liquid
stool , no blood in stool or vomit , no abdominal pain , no urinary
symptoms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI: Colitis: Given the patient&apos;s persistent and chronic
nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , there was significant concern for
small bowel obstruction on admission. However , a KUB and
abdominal CT were both negative for small bowel obstruction. She
was originally kept n.p.o. for bowel rest , and a nasogastric tube
was placed with significant drainage. Stool studies were sent
including C. difficile , ova and parasites , cecal leukocytes , and
Shigella/salmonella/Yersinia/campylobacter studies , all of which
were negative. Because of the concerning nature of the patient&apos;s
symptoms , surgery consult was called , however they felt that her
problems were likely nonsurgical in nature. CTs performed two
days and five days after admission showed identical findings of
right-sided colitis. They remained largely unchanged.
Nevertheless , the patient experienced continued nausea and
vomiting and also continued diarrhea throughout this time. Once
her nasogastric tube output decreased significantly ,
approximately one week after admission , the tube was removed and
the patient was started on p.o. , and her diet was advanced as
tolerated. From that point on , the patient had no nausea or
vomiting , and she is currently tolerating a full diet.
Nevertheless , she continues to have mild diarrhea , now two
episodes per day as compared to6 to 8 episodes per day prior to
admission. In the end , the workup for the underlying cause of
her nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea has been negative. It is
therefore our suspicion that her symptoms are most likely
secondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication , Xeloda.
Of note , the patient also has other signs of Xeloda toxicity ,
including possible hepatotoxicity ( see below ) as well as severe
cracking and drying of the skin on her hands and feet.
2. Hepatitis: A CT performed on admission to evaluate for small
bowel obstruction showed a significantly cirrhotic and fatty
liver with no masses. On admission , the patient&apos;s total
bilirubin was 2.5; however , her bilirubin levels escalated
precipitously to a maximum of 17.6. At the same time , the
patient developed clinical manifestations of this , including
scleral icterus and jaundice. Also , as her albumin levels
decreased to below 1.5 , she developed significant ascites and
peripheral edema. Gastroenterology consult suggested a right
upper quadrant ultrasound , which was negative for obstruction , a
hepatic MRI , which also showed a cirrhotic and fatty liver , and
also a diagnostic/therapeutic IR guided paracentesis , which
drained 1 liter of sterile fluid. Hepatitis serologies were also
sent , and the patient was hepatitis A and B negative , but C
positive; however , her viral load was less than assay , and her
AFP was within normal limits. A rheumatologic workup for
autoimmune hepatitis was also negative. Because of the acuteness
and the timing of her presentation , it was felt that her liver
failure was likely secondary to a combination of hepatitis and
also toxicity from her Xeloda.
On discharge , the patient&apos;s hepatic function had been improving
significantly for three days , with her albumin increasing , her
INR decreasing and her bilirubin levels also decreasing. On
discharge , her total bilirubin was 16.0 down from 17.6 , her
albumin was 1.9 up from 1.5 , and her INR was 1.6 down from 2.6.
It is anticipated that as the patient&apos;s nutritional status
continues to improve , her hepatic function will continue to
normalize with resulting normalization of her laboratory values.
3. Cardiovascular: On admission , the patient was in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate of
approximately 140 beats per minute. She was also hypotensive ,
with a blood pressure of roughly 90/60. She was placed on
cardiac telemetry , which recorded rapid a. fib. up to the 170s.
As a result , she was given IV Lopressor with decreased heart rate
but also significant reduction in her blood pressure requiring
fluid boluses. After 24 hours , after her blood pressure had
stabilized following the administration of intravenous fluids ,
she was started on a diltiazem drip at 5 mg per hour , which
helped to establish stable rate control in the 80s with continued
atrial fibrillation. At the same time , the patient was loaded
with digoxin , but her levels were high; given that the patient
was status post a recent admission for digoxin toxicity , this
medication was subsequently held. In one incident , the patient
developed a temporary junctional rhythm for approximately 5
minutes with a heart rate in the 50s. At that point , input was
elicited from the cardiology consult service , who thought that
her symptoms were likely secondary to the diltiazem drip.
However , given concern for a tachy-brady syndrome , the
possibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker was discussed.
However , the patient did not have any recurrence of the
junctional rhythm. A TTE was obtained , which showed an ejection
fraction of 60% with trace MR and moderate TR , left and right
atrial enlargement , and normal left and right ventricular
function. Once the patient was again taking p.o. medications ,
her diltiazem drip was changed to p.o. diltiazem. For the next
several days , the patient had several episodes each night of 3 to
5 beat runs of NSVT. However , on the three days prior to
discharge , the patient had no events on telemetry , and her heart
rate was stable in the 60s to 80s , with a blood pressure running
from 90-100/50-60. Shortly before discharge , the patient also
developed episodic shortness of breath , which was attributed to
mild pulmonary edema , and she responded well to boluses of IV
Lasix. As a result , she was restarted on Aldactone with
effective gentle diuresis. The plan on discharge will be to
follow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diuretic
regimen as needed to maintain her volume status with continued
improvement in her hepatic function.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus ,
and her metformin was held on admission secondary to an elevated
creatinine. As a result , she was started on a lispro sliding
scale. Given that she was n.p.o. for several days , she was not
given any insulin and her blood sugars remained stable in the low
100s. After she again started taking p.o. , she was restarted on
a sliding scale , and she maintained excellent blood sugar control
between 100 and 150. A hemoglobin A1c obtained during this
admission was also within normal limits. Of note , the patient
has a left toe ulcer , and was seen by orthopedic surgeries and
outpatient totally before admission.
5. Heme: The patient had an INR of 2.6 on admission secondary to
cirrhosis and poor nutrition. As a result , she was given vitamin
K subcu n.p.o. as needed. As noted above , despite a history of
atrial fibrillation , the patient is not on Coumadin at home
secondary to poor med compliance. At home , she was only on
aspirin , but this was also discontinue during the admission
secondary to continued guaiac positive stool. Nevertheless , her
hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission and she did
not require any transfusions. As DVT prophylaxis , the patient
was kept on Pneumo boots throughout the admission. At one point ,
she was noted to have left upper extremity swelling greater than
the right upper extremity , but an ultrasound was negative for
DVT. As noted above , on discharge , the patient&apos;s INR was
improving secondary to improved nutrition. She will be
discharged without any anticoagulation at present , however this
can be further reevaluated as an outpatient by her cardiologist
and oncologist.
6. FEN: The patient was initially rehydrated with normal saline ,
however this was changed to D5W plus 3 amps of bicarb since she
developed a bicarb gap. Once this gap was closed , she was given
gentle normal saline as maintenance fluids. Once the patient
started taking significant p.o. , her IV fluids were discontinued.
The patient&apos;s electrolytes were also repleted as necessary.
Plan on discharge will be to continue following her electrolytes
closely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiac
arrhythmias.
7. Pain: The patient was given oxycodone p.o. and morphine IV
for pain. The patient was previously on Vioxx at home for
orthopedic pain related to her diabetes , however , given recent
data suggesting possible cardiotoxic effects of Vioxx , this will
be discontinued , and she will be sent home with oxycodone p.r.n.
for pain.
8. Onc: The patient&apos;s Xeloda is currently on hold since many of
her symptoms leading up to this admission were likely secondary
to chemo toxicity. As noted above , the patient has other
evidence of chemo toxicity as well , including significantly dried
skin on her hands and feet. The patient&apos;s outpatient oncologist ,
Dr. Willard Brixius , followed her closely during this admission , and
she will follow up with the patient regarding possible changes to
her chemotherapy regimen.
9. Disposition: The patient was seen by the physical therapy
service shortly before discharge , and they noted that she
displayed difficulty even moving from the bed to the chair , which
is significantly below her baseline of being able to ambulate
independently. As a result , after extensive discussions with her
family , it was decided that the patient will be best served by
going to a rehab facility for continued closed supervision of her
medical problems , supervised administration of her medication
regimen , continued strength training and conditioning , and also
continued nutrition. Once the patient is able to be less
dependent on outside assistance , she can be sent home with either
a home health aide or visiting nurse for continued
rehabilitation. Of note , the patient&apos;s code status was
established by her outpatient oncologist as DNR/DNI. This was
confirmed with the patient during this hospitalization.

PHYSICIAN FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation facility , where
she will continue to be given supportive care for ongoing
symptoms of her enteritis and hepatic failure. She will also
receive physical therapy and nutrition to help her return to her
baseline function. Prior to discharge from rehab , her medication
regimen should be simplified as much as possible to prevent
future confusion over her medications , as has happened in the
past.
On discharge from rehab , the patient should be sent home with
either a visiting nurse or home health aide , as insurance
permits. At that point , she will follow up with Dr. Snellbaker , her
primary care physician; Dr. Fushimi , her outpatient oncologist; and
Dr. Khalili , her outpatient cardiologist.

Discharge Date: 2/30/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION , MOST LIKELY POST-
PERICARDIOTOMY SYNDROME
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY , EMPIRICAL DIAGNOSIS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Orser is a 52-year-old woman
status post mitral valve repair and
CABG in 6/28 , as well as dilated cardiomyopathy , who presented in
5/24/95 with worsening shortness of breath and left pleural
effusion , and for further evaluation and treatment of these
symptoms.
HISTORY: Patient has a long history of mitral valve prolapse. In
6/28 , she presented to Good Niton Community Hospital with history of
progressive dyspnea and congestive heart failure noted at an
outside hospital. Ejection fraction at that time on echo was 18% ,
with severe MR and TR. She was admitted and an echo done at the
Co.wer Hospital Medical Center showed moderate left ventricular dilatation with an EF of
25-30% , with only mild regional variability. There was also right
ventricular dilatation with mild decrease in function. Mitral
valve was thickened with severe MI. CAT at that time showed 71%
left-sided lesion. The patient underwent , in 6/28 , mitral valve
repair and one-vessel CABG lemma to the LAD. She had an uneventful
post-op course. Her post-op echo on 6/12/95 revealed LV
dilatation with clear EF of 23% and good IV function. Moderate
residual mitral regurgitation and moderate TR. Post-op weight of
the patient was 177 lb.
Post-operatively , the patient did well initially , when she had PND
and orthopnea that was marked prior to surgery , she is able to walk
now , and when she was only able to walk only 40 ft. before
stopping. She now sleeps flat on her bed with improved exercise
tolerance. She experiences near total resolution of the PND and
orthopnea initially. However , in the period between 6/28 to
7/30 , the above symptoms recurred with progressive shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion , cough and positional chest pains. On
3/13/95 , the patient saw her physician and was noted to have a
large left pleural effusion at an outside hospital. A left
thoracentesis was done. Patient noted 1 liter of bloody fluid that
was tapped from her thoracentesis. Post-procedural weight was 169
lb. She was able to breath more easily.
Status post the left thoracentesis , the patient initially felt
well. However , within the next few days , she continued to develop
worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion , as well as
PND and orthopnea. She , therefore , represents on 1/2/96 for
recurrence of her symptoms and recurrence of left pleural effusion.

EKG - sinus tachy at 108 , with frequent PVCs and bigeminy.
Intervals were normal. Axis of 21 degrees. Left atrial
enlargement. No acute ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Franz was initially admitted with a
diagnosis of left pleural effusion of unclear
etiology. A left thoracentesis was performed and the fluid was
deemed exudative. It was bloody in appearance and had a white
count greater than 4 , 000 , with a red cell count greater than
500 , 000. Patient met criteria for exudative fluid by
fluid-serum-LDH ratios , fluid-serum-protein ratio and LDH greater
than 200. Subsequent cultures , however , were negative for a
bacterial fungal AFB. Rheumatology etiologies were also R/O with
negative ANA and negative rheumatoid factor. Cytology was sent on
the patient , which also returned negative for malignant cells. A
total of 1.5 liters was drained from the thoracentesis. Subsequent
to the thoracentesis , the patient felt significantly better , with
better exercise tolerance and less orthopnea. She remains with RAO
to sats greater than 95% for the remainder of her hospitalization
and did not require oxygen. A repeat chest x-ray was done prior to
discharge , and compared to post-thoracentesis , showed no
significant accumulation of the left pleural effusion.
Initially it was felt that the patient&apos;s symptoms might have some
relationship to some element of congestive heart failure. She was
started on Digoxin and Captopril and maxed at Digoxin .25 q day and
Captopril 50 mg t.i.d. During this hospitalization , however , the
patient noted in passing , that she had , since her 6/28 surgery ,
developed significant dizziness and orthostatic symptoms upon
sitting up and rising , and had limited exercise tolerance partly
because of shortness of breath , but also partly because of her
dizziness symptoms. She noted occasional vertigo and occasional
diplopia. A work-up subsequently ensued related to the symptoms.
Neurology was consulted and carotid Dopplers , as well as MRA of the
head to R/O vertebral basal insufficiency were performed. Both
carotid Dopplers revealed less than 25 stenosis bilaterally and MRA
of the head revealed no vertebral basal insufficiency. However , it
was noted on repeated measurements of the patient&apos;s blood
pressures , that when she sat up and when she stood up , she became
hypotensive. A modified Bruce protocol stress test was performed
to determine the patient&apos;s exercise tolerance. Prior to initiation
of the modified Bruce , supine blood pressure was 120/80. Upon
sitting up , the patient&apos;s blood pressure was 92 and upon beginning
the modified Bruce within less than one minute , the patient&apos;s blood
pressure dipped to 60 systolic , and test was terminated. An
echocardiogram during this admission revealed an ejection fraction
of 30% , moderate LV dilatation , severe global hyperkinesis ,
preserved right ventricular function and size , and only trivial MR
and TR. No significant arrhythmias were noted on the patient&apos;s
cardiac monitor throughout her hospitalization , except for one
episode of transient third degree heart block with a ventricular
rhythm. The patient did not demonstrate this rhythm consistently ,
however , during her hypertensive episodes.
On review of the patient&apos;s past medical history , however , it was
found that the patient had been on chronic steroids for two years
prior to her 6/28 CABG and prior to the onset of these symptoms of
orthostasis and dizziness. Patient notes that she was more on than
off on p.o. steroids for treatment of her shortness of breath at an
outside hospital in Perv Rome Voraso , Nevada 15117 At that time , they had deemed that her
shortness of breath symptoms were secondary to pulmonary etiologies
rather than cardiac. We , therefore , suspected adrenal
insufficiency and consulted endocrine. ACTH stem test was
performed and Cortisol , Adolsterone and ACTH levels were drawn at
0:30 and 60 minutes post-administration of ACTH. The patient
developed hives and angioedema with the ACTH which was relieved
with Benadryl IV. After the performance of the ACTH stem test
empirically started on Hydrocortisone 80 mg IV. The next day the
patient&apos;s symptoms resolved and she no longer had any evidence of
orthostatic hypertension or dizziness symptoms related to standing
or walking. Repeated blood pressure measurements for orthostatic
were unyielding. The patient noted her symptoms are completely
resolved and that she felt like a different person. It was ,
therefore , felt that the empiric trial of hydrocortisone was
significant and that the patient most likely had adrenal
insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid for the two years prior
to the 6/28 CABG , and this was consistent with the time closer to
patient&apos;s symptoms , which began after the 6/28 CABG when she was
off steroids.
The patient was therefore discharged in stable condition with
diagnosis of a left pleural effusion secondary to most likely a
post-pericardiotomy syndrome , as well as orthostatic hypertension
and dizziness symptoms secondary to adrenal insufficiency. At the
time of discharge , the patient&apos;s ACTH stem test was still pending ,
as well as the TSH. It was felt at the time of discharge , the
patient should not be managed on Captopril or Digoxin. It remained
unclear whether or not the patient&apos;s current ejection fraction was
adequate for her symptoms.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Flexeril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d; Benadryl 50 mg
p.o. b.i.d; Prednisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d;
Prozac 20 mg p.o. qd; Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. qd; Mevacor 20 mg p.o.
qd; Quinaam 325 mg p.o. q.h.s.
DISPOSITION: Patient was discharged home to Li Ston Hi There
were no complications during this admission. Patient
was discharged in a stable condition , with no estimated disability.
The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Otha Brue in 12/10 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is a 65 yo w/CHF presenting w/episode of Vtach
at outside hospital. Pt. felt somewhat nauseous on coming home from
work on day PTA. Wife noticed pallor when he came home , called
ambulance. Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded
to lidocaine. Lidocaine drip d/c&apos;d in AM of transfer in the abscene of
further VT. Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 at
outside hospital. It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemic
event which caused VT , or if the pt&apos;s VT caused a bump in cardiac
enzymes. Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain which
worsens when the pt carries heavy things or walks
up flights of stairs. Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20% ,
w/ global hypokinesis. PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles ,
II/VI SEM worse w/inc. afterload. EKG , unchanged from
11/1 .
HOSPITAL
COURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac
service. Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and
clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was
suspicious for CAD. The
patient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to develop
worsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode of
vtach and was subsequently
diuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L. The patient was also
loaded w/amiodarone. The patient&apos;s weight also dropped 5 kg. Left and
right
coronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rt
PDA lesion 60% and a discrete 60% D1 , otherwise essentially clean. No
interventions were
necessary. The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 after
the diuresis. The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone
and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone.
The patient had an
ICD placed on 3/16/2004 .  The initial plan was for the patient to also
have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach ,
however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during
TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. An transthroracic echocardiogram
was
also performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30% , w/anterior
akinesis and global hypokinesis. A broad differential diagnosis for his
heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be
determined. The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his P
CP. These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician ,
Dr. Versteegh . He should also follow up w/Dr. Yafuso as described in that
section. For the patient&apos;s afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for the
next three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd ,
unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn on
Monday , May , and Wed September by the VNA. The patient should call an
MD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor. The patient&apos;s blood
pressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doses
while the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitate
optimization of his outpt regimens. Additional changes at the
discretion of the pt&apos;s PCP , Dr. Schwarm . The patient also presented w/an
elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the
hospitalization. The elevated creatinine was most likely due to a
combination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load from
catheterization.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
F/u as described above. INR on June .  Stop old medications.
Take only medications as prescribed from here.

Discharge Date: 1/10/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old diabetic
woman with end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis on Monday , Wednesday and Friday who has had several
recent hospitalizations for fluid overload thought to be secondary
to her end stage renal disease , last admitted on September , 2001
for the same during which she had a left internal jugular tunneled
catheter placed for hemodialysis. Since her discharge in August ,
she had been complaining of increasing shortness of breath and on
the Friday prior to admission , she was at her usual dialysis
appointment where she got a transfusion of packed red blood cells
and intravenous iron when she began to feel &quot;warm all over&quot;. The
following night , her son noted her to be rigorous and she felt the
presence of fever. She was brought to the emergency room having
received three sublingual nitroglycerin en route for shortness of
breath. Her initial vital signs showed a 90% oxygen saturation on
room air and an axillary temperature of 100 degrees. Her blood
pressure and heart rate were stable at 150/75 and 83 respectively.
In the emergency room , she became increasingly dyspneic with an
arterial blood gas of pH 7.26 , pCO2 of 64 , pO2 of 84 and was
subsequently intubated for respiratory distress. She also received
heparin in the setting of a questionable pulmonary embolus. She
had a few runs of ventricular tachycardia and became bradycardic to
the 50s. Lidocaine 100 mg x 1 was given in the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis since September , 2001
secondary to her diabetes , right lower extremity calf deep venous
thrombosis in 1995 , long-standing diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
external hemorrhoids , congestive heart failure secondary to
diastolic dysfunction , diverticulitis , appendectomy in October of
2001 , left cataract surgery.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin giving her
edema , aspirin giving her edema , Prazosin , Micronase ,
Dyazide , ACE inhibitors and intravenous contrast.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: NPH insulin 20 units in the morning , 25
units in the evening , Zocor 80 mg at
night and intravenous iron given at hemodialysis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: On admission to the Reyand Memorial Hospital medical intensive care
unit , initial physical examination showed a temperature of 105 ,
heart rate 90 , blood pressure 90/50 , respiratory rate 12 on a
mechanical ventilator , oxygen saturation 100%. GENERAL: The
patient was intubated , sedated. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic.
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodating.
NECK: Supple , no thyroid nodules noted. CHEST: She had right
greater than left crackles a quarter of the way up the lung fields.
HEART: Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4 appreciated.
No rub or gallop. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended with
hypoactive bowel sounds , but no hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:
Trace edema. NEUROLOGICAL: She was sedated and on a ventilator ,
but was responsive to repositioning and touch.
LABORATORY: Her admission laboratory values included a sodium of
140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 100 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN
31 , creatinine 5.0 , glucose 193. White blood cell count was 13 ,
hematocrit 36 , platelet count 387. Differential showed 77 polys , 4
bands , 15 lymphocytes. INR was 1.0. CK was 56. Troponin I was
0.04. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ glucose , 5-7 white blood
cells , 3-5 red blood cells. Admission EKG was normal sinus rhythm ,
flat T-waves in V5 and V6. Chest x-ray was notable for bilateral
infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 68-year-old Spanish speaking
woman with end stage renal disease from insulin
dependent diabetes on hemodialysis on Monday , Wednesday and Friday ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure
with a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1995 , notably had
several recent admissions for fluid overload and a recent placement
of a tunneled internal jugular catheter for hemodialysis. She was
admitted with fever , chills and shortness of breath on July ,
2001 requiring intubation for three days , pressor support ,
Neo-Synephrine and dopamine for two days , but was then successfully
extubated and weaned off the pressors for management outside the
intensive care unit. Her course in the medical intensive care unit
was complicated by rule in non-Q wave myocardial infarction thought
to be secondary to sepsis and hypotensive state. Her troponins
maxed in the 6-7 range , but this episode resolved without
significant EKG changes. She was titrated up on a beta blocker and
given Plavix in place of aspirin as she has an allergy to aspirin.
She was also continued on her statin. The patient would likely
benefit from further outpatient work-up of her cardiac status once
her rehabilitative course is complete , i.e. imaging and stress.
Her last catheterization was four years ago showing three vessel
stenoses of about 40-50%. She is currently getting hemodialysis
now through her arteriovenous fistula and getting dosed with
vancomycin at hemodialysis for the next four to six weeks. She had
serially positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus. The last was on February , but had
negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal
echocardiogram ( i.e. no vegetations ). She received gentamicin
briefly in addition to the vancomycin until two consecutive
surveillance cultures were negative and is now off the gentamicin.
She was noted to have a loud neck murmur and had both venous and
arterial ultrasounds which were negative for septic clot or
significant stenosis respectively. Otherwise , her post medical
intensive care unit course was uncomplicated and we restarted her
insulin regimen as her appetite increased. The patient is due for
hemodialysis on tomorrow , Wednesday , March , 2001. She needs
follow up with her primary care physician for further cardiac
evaluation , titration of her diabetes medications and follow up of
her lipids , diabetes and hypertension. Of note , the patient has
refused to give the name of her primary care physician and does not
want to return to her care. She states to the interpreter that she
would like a new primary care physician.
PLAN: 1 ) Dialysis tomorrow on Wednesday , March , 2001. 2 )
Aggressive rehabilitation for her strengthening. 3 )
Titration of diabetes medications and general healthcare
maintenance follow up.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Gerache is a 59 yo man with poorly controlled diabetes , asthma
who presented with chest pain. Over the past few weeks he has had
intermittent chest pain with activity , lasting 5 minutes , relieved
with rest. He also has shortness of breath when he
climbs stairs , but he said that this is more from
his asthma. He presented to his PCP because of
a finger injury , and then told him about the
chest pain. Pt was sent to the ED. He has
been chest pain free since the day before admission.
His finger sticks at home have been in the 200-300 range.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV - ischemia: Mr. Wanzer had a cardiac catheterization on the mor
ning of 10/06 .  He has had 3 sets of negative enzymes ( elevated CKMB but
negative troponins ). EKG significant only for j point elevation
diffusely.
-beta blocker was started
-cholesterol was checked ( elevated triglycerides 308 , total cholesterol
146 , HDL 29 ). Baseline LFTs checked.
-statin was started
-aspirin was held because of the patient&apos;s stated allergy to aspirin
( causes asthma type symptoms )
-will start patient on low-dose lisinopril
PUMP: no prior echo , consider as outpatient. appears
euvolemic.
rhythm: no active issues.
2. ENDO - on insulin at home but rarely checks his sugars. when he
does it&apos;s usually 200-300s. Hemoglobin A1c is 10.7.
Patient was continued on home regimen of NPH insulin but clearly needs
better control of his sugars as outpatient.
3. PULM:
pt says he has had asthma as a child. no record of PFTs but should
obtain as outpatient. Home inhalers continued
4. RENAL: Mr. Gaulding currently has good renal function but needs to
have his Cr checked after starting the lisinopril.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must have your kidney function checked within 1 week , please make
an appointment with your primary care doctor. Please take your
medications as instructed. Please follow up with Dr. Shiley , your
cardiologist within 4-6 weeks.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please consider carefully your lifestyle , including your diet and
exercise plans. Although you did not have blockages in your heart
vessels requiring stenting , you have started to have blockages , so the
best thing you can do is to slow this process down. This includes
losing weight through diet and exercise , taking medications including
statin , beta blocker ( atenolol ) and ACE inhibitor ( lisinopril ).

Discharge Date: 12/10/2005
ATTENDING: WOJNICKI , HOLLIS MD
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS DURING THIS ADMISSION:
Decompensated heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Non-ST elevation MI.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 61-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy and
chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overload.
The patient has a longstanding cardiovascular history: Status
post inferior MI in 1988 , CABG in 1999 with SVG to LAD , OM1 and
PDA , with subsequent PCI of SG to PDA in 1/13 in the setting of
a non-ST elevation MI that evolved into an ST elevation MI. The
patient was readmitted on 10/29/05 with decompensated congestive
heart failure. Since that time , the patient has required
increasing Lasix doses with worsening dyspnea on exertion ,
shortness of breath , a 30-pound increase in weight , worsening
three-pillow orthopnea , and increased lower extremity edema with
weeping sores. The patient presented to Scuc Valmo Medical Center
ED on 3/5/05 with blood pressure 196/97 , JVP to 16 cm ,
bilateral crackles , and right greater than left pleural effusion
on chest x-ray. BNP at the time of admission was 22 , 143 ( up from
19 , 189 on 7/13/05 ). The patient was transferred to the CCU for
nitro drip and Lasix drip. She was diuresed with a net output 2
liters on 3/5/05 .  The patient was then transferred to the
floor on a Lasix drip at 20 mg/hour plus Diuril 500 mg IV as
needed. Her nitroglycerin drip had been stopped on 1/14/05 in
the morning.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: Inferior MI in 1988 , CABG in 1999 ,
and ST elevation MI in 1/13 , ( see HPI for details ).
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes greater than 20 years.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.4 to 2.4 ) ,
likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes , but concerned for
renal artery stenosis based on the history.
6. CVA in 1991 - cerebellar.
7. Status post a right CEA in 1981 , and left CEA , that is a
carotid endarterectomy , in 1999.
8. Peripheral vascular disease , status post aortofemoral bypass
in 1999.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Toprol 200 mg daily , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , hydralazine 25 mg
t.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg
daily , Lasix 160 mg b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , PhosLo t.i.d. ,
and Lantus.
ALLERGIES:
ARBs cause hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
A 135-pack-year tobacco history. No alcohol or illicits. The
patient lives alone.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease ( mother in her 50&apos;s ).
IMAGING:
Chest x-ray on 3/5/05 showed a moderate right pleural effusion ,
cephalization and pulmonary edema. EKG showed Q waves in 2 , 3
and aVF with T-wave inversions ( old findings , no acute changes ).
Echo ( 9/19 ): EF 35% ( down from 55% in 5/24 ) , mild concentric
LVH , diffuse global hypokinesis with new akinesis of the
septal-inferior walls.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Pump - persistent volume overload , minimal response to
diuresis with 20 mg/hour Lasix drip. Attempted diuresis with
Diuril , Lasix IV , and finally nesiritide. Nesiritide
discontinued on 7/11/05 .  Torsemide was started on 7/11/05 with
improved diuresis. The patient has consistently refused
dialysis. Blood pressure was controlled during this
hospitalization with hydralazine , Isordil , and Lopressor. All
medications were stopped on 6/12/05 .  Ejection fraction 35%.
b. Ischemia - enzymes peaked on 4/13/05 with a CK of 152 , an MB
of 39.6 , and a troponin of 21.44. EKG at this time showed ST
depressions in V4 through V6. The recommendation of the
Cardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiac
catheterization. The patient refused any intervention with
cardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to her
kidneys. A decision was made to medically manage the patient.
She was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , and
heparin was stopped on 7/6/05 with enzymes trending down , and
no evidence of active ischemia.
c. Rhythm - the patient had bursts of normal sinus ventricular
tachycardia on telemetry. She was maintained on a low-dose
beta-blocker until 7/11/05 .  She has been in a normal sinus
rhythm from 4/13/05 through 6/12/05 .
2. Pulmonary: The patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 liters
secondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heart
failure. The patient&apos;s IV diuretics were stopped on 6/12/05 in
consideration of changing goals of care. If the patient becomes
short of breath in the absence of diuretics , we would recommend
morphine elixir 10 mg q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath.
3. Renal: The patient&apos;s chronic renal insufficiency was likely
secondary to hypertension and diabetes. MRA on 4/13/05 to
evaluate for renal artery stenosis showed right renal artery
stenosis. The patient&apos;s creatinine increased to 4 on 7/11/05 ,
likely secondary to diuresis. Ultrasound was refused. The Renal
consult team was following , but the patient refused any dialysis.
4. Endo: The patient&apos;s diabetes was controlled with Lantus
insulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. There was concern
for hypoglycemia on 6/12/05 in the setting with no oral intake.
All of the patient&apos;s diabetic medications have been stopped at
this time.
5. Psychiatry: The Psychiatry consult team was consulted for
major depressive disorder. There was concern for delirium.
Celexa was started for depression. Seroquel was tried p.r.n. for
insomnia and delirium , but it was stopped due to change in mental
status. The patient was able to make her own medical decisions
at the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. She understood
the risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. We will continue
no psychiatric medications at the time of discharge. May
consider Haldol for concern regarding worsening delirium.
6. The patient is currently DNR/DNI , comfort measures only. She
is being transferred to inpatient hospice at Gateho Health .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Include morphine elixir 10 mg p.o. q.2 h. as needed for shortness
of breath.
CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Poor.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 8/19/05 , and underwent diagnostic
catheterization before surgery which showed right dominant
circulation and clean coronary artery. The patient on 6/18/05
was taken to the operating room and underwent a minimally
invasive AVR replacement with a 21 Carpentier-Edwards magna
valve. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 120 minutes ,
crossclamp time was 51 minutes. The patient was weaned off the
cardiopulmonary bypass without any difficulty , on no pressors and
was taken up to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit and
extubated 4 hours later. The patient&apos;s postop course by systems ,
neurologically remained intact but had severe pain issues due to
the chest tube and pain consult was obtained and was put on a PCA
until the chest tube was removed at which point patient was put
back on her preop Ultram and was comfortable without any further
narcotic use.
Cardiovascular: Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
throughout her postoperative course with rates in the 60s to 70s
with low-dose beta-blocker and thus will be discharged to home on
only on 25 mg t.i.d. of Lopressor
Respiratory: The patient was extubated 4 hours postoperatively
and weaned off O2 without any difficulty.
GI: The patient had no issues , was put on Pepcid for GI
prophylaxis. The patient with a history of GERD and was put back
on Pepcid
Renal: Due to her allergies to Lasix , the patient was placed on
torsemide and by the postoperative day 4 , patient was making
several liters without any torsemide and so the decision was made
for the patient to be discharged to home without any torsemide ,
even though she was on 20 mg p.o. q. day preoperatively and
recommended patient to follow up with her cardiologist in a week
to see if she needs to be placed back on torsemide and needs
further diuresis.
Endocrine: The patient was on a protein protocol intraoperative
but had no further insulin requirement and was not a diabetic
preoperatively with normal A1c of 5.5 and the patient was
discharged to home without any medication.
Heme: The patient due to her allergies to aspirin and was not
placed on any anticoagulants.
ID: The patient had no infectious issue , was on vancomycin for
surgical prophylaxis. The patient was doing quite well
ambulating and back on Ultram and no further pain issues and a
decision was made for the patient to be discharged to home on
postoperative day 5.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient will be discharged on these following medications ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Niferex
150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 50 mg q. hours sleep , Ultram 50 mg

Discharge Date: 9/17/2004
ATTENDING: RAFAEL WASKO M.D.
Admitted to the Renal Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Septic arthritis and bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 54-year-old male with factor IX hemophilia , HCV with
cirrhosis and chronic ascites , HIV , diabetes , end-stage renal
disease on dialysis , and history of multiple infections including
mitral valve endocarditis , and bilateral knee replacement and
left hip replacement who was transferred from rehab with a
painful right knee in a prosthetic joint which was concerning for
a septic joint. He was in his rehab therapy one week prior to
admission when he twisted his knee. He gave him some factor IX
at this time with some relief , but in the intervening time , it
had become more painful , red and swollen , and was unable to walk
without great difficulty where as before he had been tolerating
rehab with a walker without incident. In addition , he had a
temperature to 103.0 degrees , two days prior to admission and was
given vancomycin and gentamicin dialysis the day prior to
admission. The knee , however , continued to worsen , and he has a
significant restriction in range of motion , and he reported to
the emergency department for concern for an infected knee versus
hemarthrosis. He reported some fatigue and decreased p.o.
intake. He did have chills with his fever. He denied any
shortness of breath , chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting
or bleeding. Of note , he has chronic ascites , which for the past
three months has required paracentesis three times weekly with a
total of 3 to 4 liters taken off each time. In the emergency
department , he was loaded with factor IX by the hematology
fellow. The knee was then tapped by Orthopedics , which
demonstrated only some dark blood and minimal fluid. He was
admitted to the Renal Service given that he is a dialysis
patient.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hemophilia factor IX deficiency.
2. Hepatitis C virus with cirrhosis and chronic ascites.
3. HIV.
4. End-stage renal disease , on dialysis.
5. Diabetes type 2.
6. History of mitral valve endocarditis , MSSA.
7. Status post bilateral total knee replacement and left hip
replacement.
8. History of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
9. History of upper GI bleed and lower GI bleed.
ALLERGIES:
Nafcillin , he has a rash.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included Epogen , heparin , mitogen with dialysis , Neutra-Phos ,
factor IX with dialysis , lactulose , Nephrocaps , Carnitor , insulin
sliding scale , ciprofloxacin 500 q. Sunday , Carafate , Protonix
b.i.d. , Amphojel , Compazine , and oxycodone p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is married , has five children. He has HIV and HCV from
transfusion. He is not currently working.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for factor IX deficiency hemophilia.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile , slight tachycardiac at 105 , and
normotensive at 120/72 , sating well on room air. General: He
was cachetic and chronically ill appearing , alert and oriented ,
and comfortable. Neck veins were flat. Cardiovascular exam was
notable for regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2 and a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. Chest was notable for mild
bibasilar crackles , otherwise clear. Abdomen was distended ,
notable for flank dullness. He did have normal active bowel
sounds and a peritoneal port on the right. Extremities were
notable for being wasted , warm with absent pulses. Right knee
was erythematous , edematous , and extremely tender to palpation.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
Notable for potassium of 5.2 , BUN of 42 , and creatinine of 4.2.
His liver function panel was within normal limits. His white
blood cell count was 10.4 , hematocrit 36.6 , and platelets
332 , 000. His PT was 15.4 , PTT 62.3 , and INR was 1.2. X-ray of
his right knee demonstrated an effusion and no fracture. A chest
x-ray demonstrated a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 8/22/04 , he had an incision and drainage of his right knee by
Dr. Moelter of Orthopedics. On 10/20/04 , he had a
hemodialysis-tunneled catheter placed by Interventional
Radiology. On 2/7/04 , he had a PICC line placed at the
bedside , and he underwent hemodialysis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Musculoskeletal and Infectious Disease: He was admitted to
the Renal Service for treatment of septic arthritis of his right
knee , which was a prosthetic joint. Blood cultures were positive
for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , which was the
organism , which had caused his prior endocarditis. He underwent
incision and drainage of his right knee by Orthopedic Service ,
Dr. Majka , on 8/22/04 .  In addition , his hemodialysis catheter
was pulled on 10/15/04 because it too had grown blood cultures
positive for MSSA. He had no further positive cultures once his
dialysis catheter was pulled except for 1/4 bottles coag-negative
Staph from 9/23/04 , which was attributed to contamination. He
was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin just after dialysis.
He received a total of seven days of gentamicin and was on day
#14 of a six-week course of vancomycin upon discharge. He had
some low-grade temperature during admission but only one
temperature spiked to 101 degrees. Both Orthopedics and
Infectious Disease Services were consulted and followed him
throughout admission. Orthopedics and Infectious Disease
consultant determined that if any blood cultures became positive
after removal of the hemodialysis catheter , he would need to
return to the OR for joint exploitation. Given his negative
culture this did not occur and he is discharged with prosthetic
joint in place. The joint fluid culture as well synovial tissue
and synovial culture from his I&amp;D were positive for MSSA.
Surveillance cultures were negative for seven days following the
procedure. He was instructed to continue vancomycin for a total
of six-week course and to follow up with Infectious Disease in
two months. He was cleared for physical therapy and returned to
rehab by Orthopedics with instructions to remove his sutures
three weeks after discharge and to follow up with Orthopedic , Dr.
Glader , as indicated by his symptom.
2. Hematology: He has factor IX deficiency hemophilia for which
he normally takes q. week or twice weekly factor IX before
dialysis. During admission , he was initially loaded with factor
IX in the emergency department for arthrocentesis. Hematology
was consulted and they recommended b.i.d. factor IX 4000 units
during admission while the situation regarding surgery and line
placement was unclear. He continued receiving b.i.d. factor IX
until the day of discharge as his last line was placed on that
day. He was to return to factor IX before dialysis only upon
return to rehab and was to follow up with Dr. Tutson , his
primary hematologist. In addition , he received erythropoietin
with dialysis.
3. Renal: He has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis
Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays. He continued this regimen
while he had his hemodialysis catheter in place , however , when
that was removed , he was dialyzed to a temporary femoral artery
catheter and only as clinically indicated. He was dialyzed most
recently on 10/20/04 after his dialysis catheter was replaced by
Interventional Radiology , and he should return to his Monday ,
Wednesday , Friday schedule. He was continued on his home renal
supplements. He was continued on erythropoietin with dialysis
and midodrine.
4. GI: He has HCV cirrhosis and chronic ascites and history of
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as well as upper and lower GI
bleed. He had no evidence of bleeding during admission. The
occult blood was negative x3. He additionally had no evidence of
infection or SPP. He was taped by a peritoneal port thrice
weekly with removal of 3 to 4 liters of fluid each time. The
first set was sent for culture , which was negative.
Additionally , he was continued on his b.i.d. proton pump
inhibitor given his history of upper GI bleed.
5. Endocrine: He has diabetes for which he was covered with
Regular Insulin sliding scale upon admission. Given some
elevated blood sugars up to 300s and the risk of bacteremia , he
was started on NPH and was discharged on 10 q.a.m. and 5 q.p.m.
with continued Regular Insulin sliding scale for added coverage.
6. Prophylaxis: He was not anticoagulated despite his
immobility. Given his hemophilia , he was placed on TED hose and
pneumoboots and continued on his PPI.
7. FEN: Nutrition was consulted because of his low albumin and
general cachexia. He was placed on a 1.5 liters fluid
restriction and 2 g sodium restriction given his chronic ascites.
He is also on a diabetic diet and renal diet. Nutrition
recommended supplementing with Enlive and Ensure , and the patient
had adequate oral intake during admission. He was not given IV
fluids.
DISPOSITION:

MELLITUS.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
4. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
5. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
6. STATUS POST CARDIOVERSION TO
SINUS RHYTHM.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Zack Nieman is a 62-year-old
white man with ischemic
cardiomyopathy , status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1985
with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending ,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal branch. He had a repeat coronary artery
bypass graft done in 1995 with saphenous vein graft to first
diagonal , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal , and saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery. The course was
complicated by ventricular tachycardia requiring AICD placement and
treatment with amiodarone. The patient also developed
hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone , treated with PTU , then
developed hypothyroidism , treated with Levothyroxine.
Over the past few months the patient has had multiple episodes of
pulmonary congestion. About one week ago prior to this admission the
patient was admitted to Rorea Valley Health for IV diuresis.
Echocardiography demonstrated that a reduced LV ejection fraction in
the mid 20&apos;s with moderate mitral regurgitation. Recent EKGs
provided by the Scot Free Of Hospital and on admission here shows
atrial flutter with variable ventricular rate. On admission the
patient denied peripheral edema , orthopnea , or recent gain in
weight. A recent TSH revealed 10. No recent excess caffeine or
alcohol consumption.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for ( 1 ) coronary artery
disease , status post coronary artery
bypass graft times two; ( 2 ) hypertension; ( 3 ) hypothyroidism;
( 4 ) dyslipidemia; ( 5 ) benign prostatic hypertrophy; ( 6 )
degenerative joint disease; ( 7 ) non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.
ALLERGIES: The patient has a known allergy to morphine and to
tetanus toxoid.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of myocardial infarction at age 66.
Mother died of myocardial infarction at age 63.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco use. No alcohol use. Very active
athletically. He works as a superintendant.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance , very pleasant man
in no apparent distress. Temperature
97.1 , pulse 103 , blood pressure 148/94 , respirations 18 , O2
saturation 97% on two liters. HEENT pupils are equal , round , and
reactive to light. Sclerae anicteric. Oral pharynx clear and
moist. Jugular venous pressure about 8-9 cm. No carotid bruits.
Chest clear to auscultation and percussion. No rales and no
wheezes. Heart paradoxical S2 , II/VI systolic murmur. Abdomen
soft , nontender , with no pulsatile masses. Lower extremities no
edema , no cyanosis , or clubbing. Rectal examination normal , guaiac
negative. Neurological examination grossly intact.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 101 , bicarb 34 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 220 , AST 22 , ALK 53 , total bilirubin 0.6 ,
calcium 9.8 , total protein 7.1 , albumin 4.4 , magnesium 1.9 , CK 477 ,
MB 2.7 , PT 12.7 , INR 1.1 , PTT 24.2. Urinalysis 1+ glucose ,
otherwise negative.
EKG revealed atrial flutter with variable block ( 2:1 versus 3:1 ) ,
rate around 120 , left bundle branche block.
Echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction about 25% with 2+ mitral
regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient&apos;s hospital course was notable for the
following: Upon transfer from Nes Hospital
to A Hospital the patient had no complaints of
shortness of breath or chest pain. However , the patient was having
atrial flutter with various blocks. The ventricular response at
that time was between 120-130. On the day of admission the patient also had
echocardiogram repeated which revealed ejection fraction 25% with
2+ mitral regurgitation.
Because of his rapid ventricular response , Digoxin was started with
a loading dose of 0.5 mg , then 0.25 mg times two q. six hours. The
patient was then on a maintenance dose of Digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o.
q. day , and his Digoxin level has been maintained around 0.9. For
his rate control , the amiodarone was also increased to 400 mg q.
day , and the patient was started on anticoagulation with heparin.
On August the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed old grafts serving the left anterior descending ,
posterior descending artery , obtuse marginal , patent. The
saphenous vein graft to first diagonal has 70% proximal stenosis.
Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 10-15%. Post
catheterization the patient had no complications. The patient also
had a TEE done which showed no thrombosis. Therefore on September the patient underwent cardioversion through his AICD by the
Electrophysiological Service with successful conversion to normal
sinus rhythm. The patient was loaded with Coumadin and meanwhile
on heparin until INR between 2-3.
For further investigation of his cardiomyopathy , iron studies were
sent to rule out hemochromatosis. The results were negative.
Cardiomyopathy consult was also obtained to follow-up the patient.
The patient will be discharged when his INR approaches the
therapeutic level , which is between 2-3.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril
25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , clonazepam 1 mg p.o.
q. h.s. , Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. q. a.m. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is an 80 years old female with history
of AFib and CHF , diastolic dysfunction with EF of 80% and COPD
who was recently discharged for CHF w low dose lasix of 20mg now
is found to be in CHF in a setting with suspected AFib with LVR.
The patient also had acute on chronic renal insufficiency likely
secondary to low flow from her volume status. The patient was
admitted for diuresis and for the rate control.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Ischemia: There is no evidence of ischemia. The patient was
ruled out with serial enzymes. She was continued on aspirin , no
betablocker , and short acting diltiazem and statin. Her
beta-blocker was initially not initiated , however , on three days
prior to discharge , she was started on short-dose beta-blockade
due to hypertension. She tolerated that reasonably well ,
however , did have episodes of bradycardia to 40s. Decision was
reached to defer starting betablockade on her until her
appointment with her cardiologist. Her BB was discontinued.
Pump: The patient was volume over loaded on chest x-ray with BNP
greater than 500. The patient has EF of 80% with hypodynamic
heart. The patient was diuresing initially with 80 IV Lasix and
subsequently increased to 120 b.i.d. of IV Lasix. She was
diuresed slowly at about 500 mL everyday. Ultimately , her Lasix
was switched over to 160 p.o. b.i.d. with very good diuresis , but
her creatinine was elevated , prompting decreasing her Lasix back
down to 120 p.o. b.i.d. She will continue on this dose on
discharge and has a followup with her primary care physician for
creatinine trial and make sure that her creatinine is trending
down. We did not want to over diuresis the patient given her
volume dependence and the diastolic dysfunction especially as we
suspect that the heart failure is secondary to her rhythm , but
not really significant volume overload. She had a repeat chest
x-ray three days prior to admission , which shows slightly
improving pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion. She was to
repeat lytes and her creatinine was followed very closely.
Rhythm: She was in afib w RVR initially. The patient was
started on diltiazem t.i.d. We hold her dig initially as her
level was elevated to 2.4 eventually. Her dig was restarted at
0.125 mg p.o. every three days. Her dig level will need to be
followed as an outpatient. Her dig was stable on this particular
dose. We also started her on short acting beta-blocker with
Lopressor at 6.25 t.i.d. She will be reduced to 6.25 b.i.d. on
discharge. The patient tolerated the Lopressor though had a few
episodes of bradycardia. BB was d/c on discharge.
Pulmonary: The patient has shortness of breath , despite
secondary to CHF and COPD. The patient was given nebs and her
Advair. She was on 4 liter of oxygen on discharge and she will
be self-weaned at home to 2 liter as possible.
Heme: She has chronic baseline shortness of breath. She was
continued on her Coumadin for anticoagulation. INR was stable
throughout the hospital stay.
Renal: Has acute renal insufficiency on chronic renal
insufficiency. Her Avapro was held initially. Suspect that her
acute renal insufficiency is secondary to poor flow in the
setting of AFib and atrial flutter and failure. Her renal
function actually improved slightly upon diuresis , however , she
bumped her creatinine slightly on discharge secondary to
high-dose Lasix. Her Lasix will be decreased to 120 b.i.d. p.o.
on discharge and her creatinine will be checked two days after
discharge.
ID: No evidence of infection. She has some sputum that was sent
with normal flora. Blood culture and urine culture was negative.
Chest PA and lateral was also negative for any evidence of
consolidation or infection.
FEN: She was kept on the low-salt ADA diet , cardiac diet with K
and mag repletion.
Prophylasix: Pt was anticoagulated with Coumadin and also on a
PPI.
CODE STATUS: She was full code.
DISPOSITION: She is to follow up with her primary care physician
and also cardiologist. She has appointment Dr. Kohli on
3/24/2006 at 2:40 p.m. and Dr. Mccarl , the cardiologist on
2/25/2006 at 8:40 a.m.
DISCHARGE MEDICATION: She is on aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , DuoNeb
3/0.5 neb q.6h. , Fosamax 70 mg p.o. every week , Tessalon Perles
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. , digoxin 0.125 p.o. every three days ,
diltiazem extended release 120 mg p.o. daily , iron sulfate 325 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Advair 250/50 one puff
b.i.d. , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin NPH 26 q.a.m. and 16
q.p.m. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. daily , lovastatin 20 mg p.o. at bedtime ,
and omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily.

Discharge Date: 10/26/2005
ATTENDING: MUCZYNSKI , CODY M.D.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Prepatellar bursitis versus prepatellar cellulitis with bursitis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
Peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , chronic renal
insufficiency , CAD , and history of sepsis from right lower
extremity cellulitis in the past.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Right lower extremity edema and pain in right knee.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 68-year-old male with severe PVD , diabetes mellitus ,
chronic kidney insufficiency , presents with increased right lower
extremity edema and pain progressing over four days. The patient
was recently admitted to an outside hospital for questionable
viral gastroenteritis and discharged four days ago. Since the
last admission , he was noted to have increased right lower
extremity pain and erythema , was sent home on levofloxacin as an
outpatient for presumed cellulitis. Actually , despite being on
levofloxacin , right lower extremity edema and pain increased over
four days and became more painful to walk. The patient had
subjective fevers , but none documented on record. The patient
with no severe pain over the right patellar. It hurts to flex
and/or bend the knee. Baseline right lower extremity is now much
worse than it was prior. The patient was without pain in calf or
thigh. There is no shortness of breath or chest pain. Wife
provides daily diabetic foot care , and he had recurrent
cellulitis of the right lower extremity in the past , but none in
the past year. No history of trauma. In the ED the patient with
small right knee effusion was tapped by ortho and fluid sent to
lab , it was bloody without any other growth at that time. The
patient was also given vancomycin in the ED prior to admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes PVD , peripheral vascular disease , diabetic neuropathy ,
diabetes mellitus type II , chronic renal insufficiency , CAD
status post CABG , history of GI bleed in the past , history of
sepsis from right lower extremity cellulitis in the past , status
post right femoral-peroneal bypass.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Carbamazepine 100 mg b.i.d. , NovoLog 5 mg q. a.c. , Lipitor 80 mg
once a day , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Avandia 8 mg once a day ,
Prilosec 20 mg once a day , and NPH insulin 50 mg subcu b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives with his wife , has adult children.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Sister with diabetes mellitus and CAD.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , the patient was afebrile 97.5 , pulse of 84 ,
systolic blood pressure was noted to be 137 , respiratory rate 20 ,
and 95% on room air , was found to be hard of hearing , but
otherwise in no apparent distress. Lungs were CTAB with no
wheezes. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2.
No S3 or S4. JVP was difficult to assess and no audible murmurs ,
had truncal obesity on abdominal exam with ventral hernia.
Nontender and active bowel sounds. Extremities had edema two
times the size of the left lower extremity , 20 x 10 cm patch of
pink erythematous and induration of warmth over the right knee ,
exquisitely tender over the patellar with small area of
induration over the right patella. Nontender long joint lines ,
small effusions , and pain with passive range of motion over the
patellar area. Feet were clean without cracking , maceration , or
ulcers.
PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION:
Creatinine of 2.3 , BUN of 74 , glucose of 119 , sodium and
potassium of 136 and 4.3. White cell count was 8.7 with normal
differential , 78% polys , hematocrit 34.1 , and platelets 298 , 000.
INR was 1.0. ESR was 98. Uric acid was noted to be normal.
Synovial fluid did not show crystals and gram-stain was negative.
LENI&apos;s , right lower extremity did not show DVT above the right
knee.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Musculoskeletal/ID/Rheum: This is right knee prepatellar
bursitis versus cellulitis. The patient with plain film and
x-ray , which did not show any large prepatellar bursal effusion.
No other trauma or fracture to be seen on x-ray. The patient was
doing well in-house , however , the erythema and pain did not
respond to IV vancomycin and p.o. levofloxacin at renal dosing ,
and was thought by rheumatology who graciously consulted on this
patient to have a likely prepatellar bursitis. It is also
possible this patient had a cellulitis overlying the prepatellar
area , but there is no evidence of joint infection. Tap on
11/7/05 of the prepatellar bursal fluid showed no crystals , no
polynuclear cells , and no organisms were seen. Given this ,
again , prepatellar bursitis is the primary diagnosis and the pain
did slowly resolve while inhouse. The patient was able to bend
the knee and do weightbearing , although with pain prior to
discharge without any evidence of systemic infection or sepsis.
Blood cultures on admission were no growth. Prior to discharge ,
Rheumatology suggested starting colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. for two
days followed by 0.6 mg daily for two days , followed by every
other day 0.6 mg for one week. Follow up with Wamai Hospital
as an outpatient , to follow up prepatellar bursitis and to check
uric acid , although normal on admission at this time. The
patient was stable without any signs of joint infection or
spreading fascial infection or worsening cellulitis. The
patient will also be started on Keflex despite the fact that he
did not respond to antibiotics , and this is likely a prepatellar
bursitis. In case , it is small component of cellulitis , the
patient will be kept on 10 days of p.o. Keflex at renal dose 500
mg b.i.d. as an outpatient and will be followed by Way Oa Hospital in the future.
2. Diabetes mellitus: The patient was initially not placed on
home NPH 50 mg b.i.d. and required increased NovoLog sliding
scale to 10 standing q.a.c. plus sliding scale. However , after
addition of 50 mg b.i.d. , NPH as per patient&apos;s home dose , the
patient&apos;s blood sugars ranged from 90s to 180s , which is far
improved from prior sugars in the 300s on admission. The patient
will continue on home dose NPH insulin with a NovoLog sliding
scale. Also will continue oral Avandia.
3. Cardiovascular: There were no active issues on this
admission.
4. Pain: The patient had approximately two to three times 25 mg
of oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. This will be continued for several
days as needed for pain on discharge.
5. Vascular: The patient with full LENI did not show any
thrombus in the right lower extremity on LENI.
6. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency , which
looks like acute on chronic given for unknown reasons , the
patient was initially placed on Lasix b.i.d. , but was taken down
to 80 mg once a day for lower extremity edema and swelling , given
creatinine of approximately 1.9 to 2.2. Discharge creatinine was
2.0. This will be followed up by Villerich Deo Hospital as an
outpatient. It seems that this is chronic renal insufficiency
from long-standing diabetes without a severe acute component.
The patient was on prophylactic Lovenox and Nexium while
in-house.
DISPOSITION:
Home on oral Keflex and colchicine as noted above.
DIET ON DISCHARGE:
Diabetic diet , 2 , 100 calorie per day , a low saturated fat , and
low-cholesterol diet. Walking , with weightbearing as tolerated.
Elevate legs and knees with prolonged sitting.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Include his home medications , fish oil capsule p.o. b.i.d. ,
Avandia 8 mg p.o. daily , carbamazepine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Novolin sliding scale , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , metoprolol
tartrate 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , will be on Keflex 500 mg b.i.d. x10
days , Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily from now on given renal
insufficiency , Avalide is being held until future notice , Novolin
5 to 10 units before breakfast and dinner , Prilosec OTC 20 mg
b.i.d. , colchicine as noted above 0.6 mg b.i.d. for two days , 0.6
mg daily for two days , followed by seven day of every other day ,
colchicine , oxycodone 5 mg q.4h. p.r.n. for pain , will receive
eight tablets for pain control and four tablets of Ativan 0.5 mg
p.r.n. for anxiety t.i.d. , again four pills only at the time of
discharge.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:
The patient is stable.

Discharge Date: 3/15/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: October , 1997 , coronary artery bypass graft
times three with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to diagonal
one.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Effner is a 74 year-old
gentleman , status post inferior
myocardial infarction in 1995 , and percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in September , 1995. The
patient is also status post stenting of the left anterior
descending artery in September , 1996. After that time , the patient
continued to have chest pain , although with decreased frequency and
intensity. The patient did receive Ticlid for six to eight weeks
following the stenting.
The patient presented with increased frequency and duration of his
chest and epigastric pain. The patient denied shortness of breath ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , diaphoresis , nausea or
vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , hyperlipidemia , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation in 1982 , osteoarthritis and diet controlled
diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES: Amoxicillin , which gives him arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;
Imdur 120 milligrams p.o. q.a.m. and 60 milligrams
p.o. q.p.m.; Cozaar 100 milligrams p.o. q.a.m.; Atenolol 50
milligrams p.o. q.d.; Norvasc 5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no smoking history and rarely
drinks alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx without
lesions. Carotids 2+ without bruits. The
neck is supple. The lungs are clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination is a regular rate and rhythm with an S4.
Normal S1/S2. Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , with
normal active bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse and femoral pulses
are 2+ bilaterally without bruits in the femoral arteries.
Neurological examination is without gross focal abnormality.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 40.8.
Glucose 188 , creatinine 1.8. CK 40.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service
for management and evaluation of his angina. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 1997 , demonstrating
90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis , 99% diagonal
one ostial stenosis; circumflex was okay. The right coronary
artery had a mid stenosis of 50%. The patient arrived in the
Catheterization Lab with mild angina on 200 micrograms per minute
of intravenous nitroglycerin. Post catheterization , the patient
developed 5/10 chest pain with an increasing pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure to 40 and D-waves of 52. Increasing the
nitroglycerin led to resolution of these changes. The patient had
intra-aortic balloon pump placed via the right femoral artery with
return of the wedge to approximately a mean of 6 and his pain was
relieved. The patient returned to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
where he underwent aggressive heart rate and blood pressure
control. He was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken to the
Operating Room on October , 1997 , for coronary artery bypass
grafting times three as described above. The patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Electrocardiogram
remained unchanged. He was extubated without difficulty. The
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient was noted to
have slight confusion on postoperative day number one and two.
Lopressor was restarted and the patient was gently diuresed. His
chest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day number three ,
the patient was noted to be slightly more confused with left facial
droop and aphasia that resolved with mild left lid lag in the early
afternoon. The patient was evaluated by Neurology. A head CT scan
was performed , demonstrating no hemorrhage or acute stroke. There
was a small left cerebellar hemisphere lesion that was believed to
be consistent with a lesion that was greater than 24 hours old.
The patient , however , became progressively encephalopathic. The
patient underwent an echocardiogram and carotid studies , which
demonstrated no evidence of embolic source. The patient&apos;s
expressive aphasia and facial weakness , however , recurred. The
patient again underwent head CT scan , demonstrating acute right
parietal infarction that appeared cortically based. Given the
recent intra-aortic balloon pump placement , the aorta could not be
ruled out as a source for embolus. Therefore , heparin was started ,
as was Coumadin. The goal INR is 2 to 3. Also the patient had a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , and although had no
evidence of atrial fibrillation , there was concern over potential
cardiac source for embolization. The patient&apos;s aphasia and left
facial droop improved steadily. He was evaluated by the Speech and
Swallowing Service. He had no difficulty with swallowing; however ,
it was felt that he would benefit from language therapy in addition
to his physical therapy and occupational therapy. The remainder of
the patient&apos;s course was uncomplicated from a cardiac standpoint.
His chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated very small left
sided effusion without any significant failure.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation
for reconditioning and intensive speech , physical
therapy and occupational therapy. He will follow-up with Data Medical Center
Cardiology in one to two weeks. He will follow-up with Dr. Bost
in four to six weeks. He will receive physical therapy ,
occupational therapy and speech therapy. He must also follow-up
with his internist , as he has been requiring a sliding scale
insulin dosing , with previously diet controlled diabetes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; Colace 100 milligrams p.o.
t.i.d.; sliding scale insulin; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.;
Coumadin , with goal INR of 2-3 , to be dosed q.d. after checking a
prothrombin time.

Discharge Date: 12/10/2006
ATTENDING: GIZINSKI , LESLEY M.D.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Marcel Suders of RH .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Vomiting and hypertension.
OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSIS: Include diabetes , end-stage renal
disease , gout , hypercholesterolemia , and primary biliary cirrhosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 51-year-old woman with
end-stage renal disease on three times a week hemodialysis who
vomited during hemodialysis on the day prior to admission. She
completed her hemodialysis , went home , and continued to have
multiple episodes of non-biliary emesis. She was unable to take
po&apos;s including her antihypertensive medications. She did not
report any change in appetite though she was reluctant to eat due
to concerns about vomiting. She did not have any sick contacts.
She did go to a barbeque over the weekend but no one else at the
picnic was known to be sick. She does not feel feverish per se
but does report some sensation of feeling heated while at dialysis ,
no chills. She has had normal bowel movements. She does report
a cough , which is productive of clear sputum. No chest pain , no
shortness of breath. She does have some abdominal pain that
occurs with her vomiting and retching. No visual changes from
baseline. She also reports dysuria and some increased frequency
of urination on the morning of admission. Of note , the patient
has been admitted in July of this year with
a similar presentation of nausea and vomiting with increased blood
pressures , which resolved with treatment for nausea and the
resumption of her blood pressure medications.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications prior to admission included regular insulin
on a sliding scale , aspirin 81 mg per day ,
Plavix 75 mg per day , metoprolol 50 mg three times a day ,
nifedipine 30 mg four times a day , losartan 100 mg once a day ,
allopurinol 100 mg every other day , Nexium 20 mg once a day , ursodiol
300 mg once a day , and Colace twice a day. The patient also
reports taking clonidine 0.1 mg three times a day.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis three times a week , diabetes mellitus type 2 with
retinopathy and neuropathy , hypertension , coronary artery disease
status post stent x4 in September 2005 , shown on repeat cardiac
catheterization in October 2006 to be patent , gout , primary
biliary cirrhosis , hypercholesterolemia , polymyalgia rheumatica. She is also
status post hysterectomy and status post cataract
surgery.
ALLERGIES: Though she does not report having any drug allergies , her
chart notes unspecified reactions to oral
hypoglycemics and calcitriol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not use tobacco and does not drink
alcohol. She lives with relatives.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient&apos;s vital signs
were temperature 97.8 , heart rate 79 , blood pressure 148/79. Her oxygen
saturation was 95% on room
air. She was not in any acute distress. Her JVP was flat. Her
mucous membranes were moist. She did not have cervical
lymphadenopathy. Her lungs were clear. Her cardiovascular exam
showed regular rate and rhythm with a loud 3/6 systolic murmur best
heard at the left upper sternal border. Her abdomen was
nontender and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present. No
hepatosplenomegaly was noted on exam. She did not have rebound
or guarding. She did not have lower extremity edema. Distal pulses
were present.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent labs on admission include: white
blood cell count of 4 with 81% polys and hematocrit of 35.5. Her
bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.3. Her amylase was 82. Her
lipase was 15. Her EKG showed sinus rhythm. Studies included a
chest x-ray on 10/28/06 , which showed stable cardiomegaly with
some interval progression in her mild interstitial edema and
stable bilateral effusions. She had a CT of her abdomen and
pelvis on 10/19/06 , which showed small bilateral pleural
effusions and a small pericardial effusion , splenomegaly with a
spleen measuring 16 cm. The liver appeared normal other than for
an area of focal fat or perfusion anomaly adjacent to the
falciform ligament. Gallstones were present. The stomach and
the small bowel were decompressed. There were no findings to
explain nausea or vomiting , and there was no evidence of bowel
obstruction. The patient also had an MR angio of the abdomen on
10/19/06 , which was unremarkable. Splenomegaly , cholelithiasis ,
and a trace pericardial effusion were noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 51-year-old woman with a
history of end-stage renal disease who presented with nausea and
vomiting and hypertensive urgency likely secondary to her
inability to tolerate her p.o. blood pressure medications.
1. GI. The patient had nausea and vomiting , which was
controlled with Reglan initially IV. She was then transitioned to
p.o. She had resolution of her nausea , but the nausea returned
when the Reglan was stopped , so she was maintained on a standing
dose of 5 mg Reglan before meals. An abdominal CT was done
and did not find evidence of obstruction or any other findings to
explain nausea or vomiting. An MR angiogram of the abdomen was
also done to evaluate for the possibility of vascular disease ,
but this exam was unremarkable.
2. Cardiovascular. There was concern for demand ischemia given
the patient&apos;s history of coronary artery disease and high blood
pressure. She did have a troponin of 0.38 , which came down to
0.25 , and then was undetectable. With treatment for nausea , the
patient was able to take her p.o. medications and her blood
pressures were controlled. Her metoprolol dose was increased to
75 t.i.d.
3. Renal. The patient was continued on Monday , Wednesday ,
Friday hemodialysis while she was in the hospital.
4. ID. The patient continued to have a low-grade temperature
while she was in the hospital. Multiple blood cultures were
drawn , which did not show any growth. She did have one UA , which
showed bacteria but which also had epithelial cells. She did
receive a seven-day course of antibiotics. She was
initially started on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl given
concern for an abdominal process and then was switched and
covered briefly with ceftazidine before continuing the rest of
her course on levofloxacin. The patient was also tested for
tuberculosis given her persistent fevers and her history of
cough. She had a PPD placed on the day of discharge , which will
need to be read at dialysis on 6/15/06 .  The patient&apos;s
allopurinol was discontinued due to a concern that it could be
contributing to her fever.

cardiac risk factors including possible hypertension , and possible
history of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has had a history of
atypical chest pain , including a cardiac workup in the past with an
echocardiogram in 1995 showing concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy , asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal
ejection fraction at this time. In October of 1997 , he had an
exercise tolerance test at which time he went eight minutes , with a
maximal heart rate of 151 , maximal blood pressure 226/90 , and no
electrocardiogram changes. At 2 p.m. on the day of admission he
developed substernal chest pain with a crushing tightness ,
radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was not short of
breath. He experiences pain on and off through the afternoon ,
although the pain was never completely gone. At 6 p.m. , he became
acutely worse , and at that time called the EMT and was brought to
Nama Emergency Department. Within the
Emergency Department , the patient was noted to have ST elevations
in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in the NPA/TPA trial.
Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was given Lopressor ,
oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and heparin. He did not drop his
pressure with sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes prostate
cancer in September 1997 , status post XRT , as well
as a possible transient ischemic attack in 1990.

pressure 83/30 in the Emergency Department , he was afebrile , with
oxygen saturation level 99 percent on two liters. HEENT
examination , the oropharynx is benign , he had a left facial droop.
The neck was supple , 2+ carotids without bruit. Jugular venous
distention was normal. The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The heart had a regular bradycardic rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no organomegaly. The
extremities were warm and well-perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema , trace distal pulses. Neurologically , he was alert and
oriented x three , cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly intact
except for a left facial droop. Motor and sensory were grossly
intact.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Admission labs showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate of
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136. White count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8.
Troponin on admission was 0.0. INR was 1.0 , partial thromboplastin
time was 22.6. The patient&apos;s first electrocardiogram in the
Emergency Department showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 with
first-degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees. He had ST elevations of
4 millimeters in leads 3 and aVF , 3 millimeters in 2 , ST depression
0.5 to 3 millimeters V2 through V5 , 1 and aVL. Chest x-ray did not
showed acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his electrocardiogram
changes , but had persistent jaw pain , remaining at 5/10. He was
taken to catheterization , which demonstrated a mid right coronary
artery lesion of approximately 95 percent with a clot , but with
TIMI-III flow. No intervention was done at that time. The patient
initially required vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good
blood pressure , but remained essentially stable and pain-free. He
had a drop in hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his
catheterization secondary to blood loss of the right femoral triple
lumen site placed in the Emergency Ward prior to tPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the Floor , where
he maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
post myocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory to have
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting of
this lesion , and to see if it continued to persist.

over the last four years prior to admission. He currently denied
any angina , diaphoresis , nausea , orthopnea , PND , presyncope or
syncope. The patient had been treated with serial transthoracic
echocardiograms which revealed an ejection fraction worsening
from 60% down to 40% along with aortic stenosis. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization , which revealed no significant coronary artery disease
and elevated left and right

Hospital course:
This is a lovely 79 year-old lady with multiple risk factors for
atheroscosis , including long standing HTN with evidence of LVH on Echo
from 2004 , DM II complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age.
She presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heart
failure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , PND ,
fatigue , and peripheral edema. Her physical exam was significant for an
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced
PMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. Even though the
patient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% ,
suggesting a recent development of CHF. Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB ,
and no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB ,
and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a
recent ischemic event. Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative
during her first 24 hours stay. She had a stress MIBI showing no
scars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. An
Echo showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal
pulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. Extensive
interviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of
HF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP
remained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded
well to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and
Spironolactone 12.5mg. Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and
with gentle ambulation. One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray
arteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. However
considering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with
globaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will be
evaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered.
She will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic gastric cancer.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease
status post myocardial infarction in 1992 followed by CABG of two
vessels. Upper GI bleed from a gastric ulcer , anemia , GERD ,
hypertension , diabetes type 2 , and history of buttock cellulitis.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old
male , history of CAD status post MI and CABG , upper GI bleed from
gastric ulcer admitted for failure to thrive , nausea and vomiting
and chronic abdominal discomfort. The patient most recently was
admitted on 1/26/2006 for upper GI bleed from a gastric ulcer ,
which was cauterized on EGD during that admission , however ,
without any biopsy. Unfortunately , he was then discharged on
iron supplementation , told to avoid aspirin and alcohol in set up
with a followup EGD in 3 months , however , since then the patient
has had persistent nausea and vomiting combined with burping and
inability to tolerate p.o. , especially solids. His vomit has
been nonbloody yellow. He also reports a 20 pound weight loss
over the last two months. He describes a chronic epigastric
discomfort over the time , which is more of a &quot;hunger feeling then
an acute pain&quot;. Denies any change in bowel movements including
hematochezia although he has chronic black colored stools , which
he attributes to his iron supplementation. He reports weight
loss. He reported a weight loss to his PCP who sent him to the
ED for further evaluation of this abdominal pain with a suspicion
of GI bleeding. In the ED , he only had minimally guaiac positive
stool , however right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed multiple
hepatic lesions. The patient was then admitted for inability to
tolerate p.o. and the concurrent workup of cancer.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission , the patient had
stable vital signs with a temperature of 98.1 , pulse of 57 , blood
pressure 158/72 , respirating 16 with an oxygenation of 96% on
room air. He was in no apparent distress , alert and oriented x3.
He had a flat JVP. He had a sternal scar. He had regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen
was slightly obese. It was soft with positive bowel sounds. He
had mild discomfort to deep palpation but no tenderness , no
palpable hepatosplenomegaly but questionable dullness to
percussion at the left final intercostal space in the mid
axillary line. His extremities were without edema with good
pulses.
PERTINENT LABS: Chemistry panel was unremarkable. His CBC was
unremarkable as well. He had except for low hematocrit of 31.2.
His LFTs were unremarkable except for mildly elevated , AST at 31.
As mentioned above , he had right upper quadrant ultrasound ,
which showed multiple hepatic lesions.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: GI/Onc: The patient was admitted
with nausea , vomiting and inability to tolerate p.o. , along with
a weight loss. He had an emergency room right upper quadrant
ultrasound with hepatic lesions , which was highly suspicious of
malignancy and he was thus admitted for inability to tolerate
p.o. and a concurrent workup of his hepatic lesions for
malignancy. He had an abdominal CT , which confirmed that there
was a gastric mass and hepatic lesions with surrounding
lymphadenopathy. He subsequently had an EGD , which revealed a
fungating mass which was later confirmed on biopsy to be invasive
adenocarcinoma , poorly differentiated. He was then referred to
oncology who informed the patient of his diagnosis with his
family. The patient decided to undergo chemotherapy with full
FOX. He was then placed with the Port-A-Cath access on
2/2/2006 and he received his full FOX on 1/9/2006 without
incident. Throughout he was controlled on antiemetics. He was
continued on his outpatient dose of Nexium as before NSAIDS and
aspirin were avoided.
Heme: The patient had a stable hematocrit on admission. He
however given his history of GI bleeding , was closely watched and
was transfused for goal hematocrit above 28. He only received
one unit of packed red blood cells on 1/30/2006 as noted. The
patient received an EGD with biopsy of his of his lesion on
1/29/2006 .  There was some problem with controlling his bleeding
postbiopsy surgery and interventional radiology were aware of
this. He was closely monitored for any hematocrit drop.
Fortunately , his hematocrit remained stable and he did not
require any acute intervention. He did receive some p.o. vitamin
K intermittently for his elevated INR of 1.5.
Musculoskeletal: The patient did complain of his spine pain. He
says this pain however has been chronic throughout the years. He
did have a spinal MRI , which did not show any evidence of
metastatic disease or cord compression. It did reveal only mild
degenerative joint disease.
Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on his home
medications for his hypertension , coronary artery disease and
history of MI. There were no acute issues during this hospital
stay.
Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was held off his oral
hypoglycemics and put on an insulin sliding scale as well as a
standing NPH insulin dose. For his hypercholesterolemia , he was
continued on his home dose of Vytorin , which was administered as
separate Zetia and Zocor.
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: Given his poor inability to
tolerate p.o. , he was given IV fluids on admission. His diet was
advanced to clears and intermittently he was held n.p.o. for
procedures and for his episode of bleeding status post his
biopsy. However , he was then successfully advanced on his diet.
Nutrition was consulted and did leave recs for possible TPN
administration. If the patient should not be able to tolerate
p.o. in the long run however , he is doing well and TPN will be
held off for now.
Prophylaxis: The patient is prophylaxed on a PPI on his home
dose as well as Lovenox. The patient is full code.
Key features of physical exam at discharge , the patient remains
in stable condition. His physical exam is unchanged.
DISPOSITION AND FOLLOW UP TESTS: The patient will be discharged
home with VNA as well as with an infusion pump to administer
outpatient chemotherapy of 5-FU. The patient should follow up
with his primary care provider Dr. Rydelek and as well as his
oncologist , Dr. Moyers . He will continue on his chemotherapy
protocol per Dr. Thamphia . His p.o. intake should be monitored and he
potentially should have an appointment with outpatient nutrition
to evaluate whether TPN should be started or not. He should
continue on his antiemetics , his pain control and a bowel
regimen.

Discharge Date: 5/7/2006
ATTENDING: SECKMAN , JEREMIAH M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and jaw discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Harpst is a 71-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial flutter who
started to develop shortness of breath , which worsened the night
prior to admission. This is consistent with her previous
sensation that she gets when her heart rate increases with atrial
flutter. She also noted some jaw soreness , which she commonly
feels with increased heart rate. At the time , she was seen in the
hospital , she was asymptomatic. She also gets some pain under
her breasts bilaterally when her heart rate increased. She
denies any orthopnea and no leg swelling or PND. Her exercise is
limited by claudication , which worsens in cold weather. Also
when she gets up quickly , she continues to feel lightheaded but
no loss of consciousness. She is steady on her feet.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever , some nausea today , no vomiting , and
little bit of diarrhea for one week but nonbloody. She has a
history of colitis. No dysuria. No hematuria. No new joint
pains.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , sick sinus
syndrome with bradycardia status post a pacemaker placement in
1986. She has had high cholesterol. She has coronary artery
disease status post an MI in 1992 , a CABG in 1992 , LIMA to LAD ,
SVG to PDA. She has also had PCI x2. She has peripheral
vascular disease. She is status post angioplasty. She has
diabetes , status post cholecystectomy , status post pelvic floor
suspension x2 , status post appendectomy and status post lysis of
adhesions for bowel obstruction and colitis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Digoxin 0.125 mg daily , lisinopril 5
mg daily , Pravachol 20 mg each night , diltiazem XR 360 mg daily ,
Plavix 75 mg daily , Asacol 1200 mg twice daily , cilostazol 50 mg
twice daily , Toprol-XL 300 mg daily , Coumadin 2 mg daily ,
metformin 500 mg twice daily , nitroglycerin , lorazepam 0.25 mg in
the morning and midday and then 0.5 mg at night , she does not
take aspirin.
ALLERGIES: She has allergies to sulfa , which cause a rash ,
penicillin causes angioedema , tetracycline , and H2
blockers.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She has a 40+ pack
year of smoking , quit in 1986. No drinking currently but has in
the past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 96.1 , pulse 82 ,
blood pressure 130/60 , respiratory rate 24 and saturating 92% on
3 liters. General: She is in no acute distress , appears stated
age. HEENT: She is anisocoria , left greater than right ,
reactive to light. Neck is supple. JVP is 6 cm.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. Respiratory: She has crackles at the
bases. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds , soft , nontender , and
nondistended. Extremities: Warm and dry , no edema , and 1+
distal pulses. She is alert and oriented x3.
Her EKG shows V pacing with underlined flutter. Labs were
notable for a creatinine of 0.8 , and a hematocrit of 29.2. CK
and troponins were negative. Studies performed during her
admission , chest x-ray showed atelectasis. An echo prior to
admission showed mildly reduced EF , hypokinetic septum , LAE ,
dilated RA , and normal AR , 3+ MR , trace PR. A MIBI performed
during this admission showed moderate aortic ischemia in the
anterior wall and in the diagonal territory. Chest x-ray on
10/2/2006 , later on admission showed improved pulmonary edema ,
slightly increased size of small effusions , and no infiltrate.
She had a TEE , which showed no clot and a mild-to-moderate
decreased EF. She had a TTE with bubble study on 7/5/2006 ,
which showed no shunt , and an EF of 45%. She had PFTs , which
showed a mixed restrictive and obstructive picture that was
mild-to-moderate in severity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Cardiovascular:
1. Rhythm: Ms. Prestage has a long history of atrial flutter ,
which has been poorly controlled despite extremely high doses of
beta-blockers , diltiazem , and digoxin. She underwent a TEE and
DC cardioversion and remained out of atrial flutter , and V paced
at 60 beats per minute for remainder of her admission.
2. Ischemia: She has a significant history of coronary artery
disease. After her DC cardioversion , she continued to complain
of shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxic on room air
which we discussed below. She did have the positive MIBI as
discussed above , but given her significant previous
interventions , the thought was to continue to manage her
medically since this would not likely be amenable to intervention.
3. Pump: In 2002 , she had an EF of 45 to 55%. She was not on
any signs of decompensated CHF , although her shortness of breath
did improve marginally with some gentle diuresis. A repeat TTE
on 7/5/2006 showed an EF of 45% , which was relatively unchanged
from 2002.
Respiratory: Status post her cardioversion , she was found to be
saturating in the mid 80s on room air and desaturating further on
ambulation. Pulmonary was consulted and a room air ABG was
obtained that showed pH 7.48 , pCO2 33 , and pO2 52. She had no
evidence of carbon monoxide , no methemoglobinemia. Her PFTs were
as described above. With a gentle diuresis and with more
ambulation , she improved. It is unclear why she had this transient
hypoxemia. Pulmonary recommended a trial of Advair and Spiriva ,
if these made her feel better to continue these , if not then she
could stop them. Also mentioned , she underwent a bubble study
which showed no shunt. In sum , there was a question as to whether this may be
related to atelectasis plus some underlying
COPD plus her underlying small effusion. She was scheduled to
follow up with pulmonary clinic after discharge.
Peripheral vascular disease: She has been improved since three
years ago and she had a peripheral PCI. She was stable on
cilostazol.
Heme: On Coumadin for her atrial flutter.
Endo. We held her oral anticoagulants and her oral agents while
she was inhouse and insulin sliding scale was restarted metformin
on discharge.
Ms. Chafin was discharged to home with a plan to have her INR
checked as usual with Dr. Majica office and to have follow up
PFTs at her followup appointment with the In Bingenu Na Plama Leah on 10/9/2006 at 3 p.m. at Thou Bernsing Also she
is to follow up with Dr. Chivers who would arrange with her ,
after she home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every four hours
as needed for headache , digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth daily , Lomotil
2 tabs by mouth four times daily as needed for diarrhea ,
lisinopril 5 mg daily , lorazepam 0.25 mg by mouth in the morning
and midday and then 0.5 mg lorazepam at bedtime , Coumadin 3 mg at
bedtime , Pravachol 20 mg by mouth at bedtime , diltiazem XR 360 mg

Discharge Date: 5/12/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman
who is admitted for aortic valve
replacement on August , 2002. He has has asymptomatic aortic
stenosis. He also has known coronary artery disease having
undergone angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary
artery in 1991. Catheterization at that time demonstrated an 80%
left anterior descending lesion and a 60% first diagonal lesion.
He has had a 4-5 year history of shortness of breath diagnosed with
mild aortic stenosis and followed clinically. In the planning
process for knee surgery , serial echocardiograms were performed
showing decreased aortic valve area and decreasing ejection
fraction. Most recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severe
aortic stenosis and has been suggested to have the valve replaced
before undergoing knee surgery. The patient was admitted for
elective aortic valve replacement prior to knee surgery. He has a
history of class II heart failure , slight limitation of physical
activity. He is in normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , degenerative
joint disease of the bilateral knees , left greater than right ,
status post left total knee replacement in 1994 with persistent
symptoms to undergo surgery for his knee , benign prostatic
hypertrophy , decreasing hearing , left greater than right.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: A total knee replacement in 1994 ,
appendectomy in the 1960s.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Diltiazem ER 180 mg once a day , Isordil
30 mg three times a day , enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg once a day , Zocor 10 mg once a day , Cozaar 25 mg
once a day , Humulin N 30 units in the morning and 14 units in the
evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 80 and regular.
HEENT: Dentition is without evidence of
infection. NECK: No carotid bruits were heard. CHEST: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. He has a systolic ejection murmur
at 3/6 in the aortic area radiating to the carotids. ABDOMEN:
Soft and non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left total knee replacement
incision , no varicose veins. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission include a BUN of 13 ,
creatinine 1.3 , white blood cell count 6.0 , hematocrit
40.7. His echocardiogram performed on June , 2001 demonstrated
an TPP Hospital65% , aortic stenosis with a mean gradient
of 42 mm Hg , peak gradient of 63 mm Hg , calculated valve area of
0.9 cm squared with mild mitral insufficiency , trivial
insufficiency and a mildly dilated left atrium. EKG shows normal
sinus rhythm at 88. Chest x-ray is clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent coronary arteriography on
August , 2002 at Wi Wirolllen Hospital .
This examination showed a right dominant system with a diffuse 40%
lesion of the left main , discrete 50% lesion of his proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery , a 70% lesion of his mid left
anterior descending artery with an 80% distal lesion. He also had
an 80% lesion of his first diagonal and a diffuse 50% proximal
lesion of the same vessel , 70% ostial lesion of his circumflex and
an eccentric 45% lesion of his right coronary artery with a 70%
lesion in his large left ventricular branch. The patient went to
the operating room on August , 2002 where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve
and a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the first marginal and saphenous vein graft
to the posterior left ventricular branch. His intraoperative
course was uneventful. He was seen in consultation by the Diabetic
Management Service for blood sugar control and initiation into the
Portland Protocol for intravenous insulin. His postoperative
course was complicated by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation
which was treated with replacement of his electrolytes and
initiation of Lopressor therapy and also mild anemia that was
monitored and addressed with diuresis for fluid overload. His
postoperative course was uneventful. He continued to require
diuresis for pleural effusion. Chest x-ray on discharge
demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions. His hematocrit on
discharge is 25.6. At this point in time , there is no need to
transfuse the patient. He is stable. Heart rate is stable. He is
on room air oxygenating at 97%. He is to be discharged to
rehabilitation on the following medications.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Colace 100 mg three times a day ,
albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. ,
Atrovent 0.5 mg q.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg twice a day , Lopressor 50 mg
three times a day , Lasix 40 mg once a day , enteric coated aspirin
325 mg once a day , simvastatin 20 mg at h.s. , potassium replacement
20 mEq once a day , CZI scale , NPH insulin 20 units in the morning
and 10 units pre-dinner.

section.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history of
end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status post
bilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months of
worsening ascites of unclear etiology. His hospital course by
problem is as follows:
1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeutic
paracentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with total
protein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradient
greater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likely
due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure.
Ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. Therefore , it
was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytology
of the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. After
consultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded that
the ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore the
patient should undergo reduction of volume through
ultrafiltration at dialysis. This process was begun as an
inpatient by the renal service. While the patient was an
inpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated by
development of hypotension during dialysis as
well as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
with heart rates up to the 140s. Due to the difficulties with
removing fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option of
undergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine ,
but the patient and the family declined to participate in such
care. It should also be noted that despite our efforts , the
patient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were put
into place in the patient&apos;s diet order , therefore also making it
difficult to treat the patient&apos;s volume overload. The patient
was discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatient
dialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce the
patient&apos;s volume overload. This plan was communicated by the
attending renal , Dr. Simon Esbrandt , to the patient&apos;s outpatient renal
attending , Dr. Archie Chhum .
2. Renal: As described above , the patient has end-stage renal
disease - on hemodialysis. As described above , ultrafiltration
was attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possible
and to reduce the patient&apos;s volume overloaded state.
Ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continue
to attempt to counteract the patient&apos;s volume overload.
3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history of
coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usual
aspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgical
revision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned.
However , after discussion with the patient&apos;s vascular surgeon ,
Dr. Herb Piecuch , it was decided that the patient&apos;s volume
overload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgical
revision of his right leg. Therefore , aspirin and Plavix were
restarted on 11/16/2007 .  Pump: The patient has evidence of
right heart failure by echocardiogram. On physical exam and as
described above , this is likely a consequence of the patient&apos;s
volume overload. Again , as described above , volume was removed
through ultrafiltration at dialysis. Rhythm: The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likely
for fear of noncompliance. The patient was in normal sinus
rhythm for the majority of this admission but on 1/8/2007 , the
patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular with
rates to the 120s to 140s. However , the patient refused to
accept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused to
cooperate with the administration of intravenous medications for
heart rate control. Therefore , the patient&apos;s dose of oral
Lopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his blood
pressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s and
were not optimally controlled. However , the patient refused
further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was
therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient
with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker
regimen.
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his home insulin
regimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightly
basis with adequate control of blood sugars.
5. Vascular: As described above , the patient has a right
below-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. As
described above , after discussion with the patient&apos;s vascular
surgeon , Dr. Mel Bierut , it was decided that the patient&apos;s
surgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after his
issues with volume overload are resolved.
6. Infectious disease: It was noted that the patient has as a
likely paronychia of his left index finger. Plain films were
obtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. A
hand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that there
were no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgent
surgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. The
patient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continue
taking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on
6/11/2007 .  Oxycodone was administered for pain control of his
left finger as well as for pain control of his right leg.
Prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and placed on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
The patient was full code during this admission.
PHYSICIAN FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has a followup appointment
with his vascular surgeon , Dr. Huey Lamond , on 10/26/2007 at
2:30 p.m. , phone number 178-843-9703. The patient should call
his doctor his primary care physician , Dr. Jamal Gehlert ,
telephone #204-180-5657 , for appointment in two to three weeks.
The patient will continue dialysis at Gentville under the
direction of Dr. Alphonso Berwald on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday
schedule. This patient should complete a total of 14-day course
of levofloxacin to end on 6/11/2007 for his left fourth finger
paronychia/skin infection. The patient&apos;s beta-blocker should be
titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better
control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As described
above , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to remove
total body volume.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. COPD.
2. Arrhythmia.
3. AVNRT/SVT.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
On admission was shortness of breath and fever.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 73-year-old male with COPD , hypertension , chronic renal
insufficiency , CHF , with ejection fraction of 60% , pulmonary
hypertension , and arrhythmias who was discharged on 5/10/05 but
returned later in the evening complaining of worsening shortness
of breath and fevers at home. On prior hospitalization , the
patient had presented on 10/10/05 with acute shortness of breath
and hypertension with chest pain and was ruled out for MI and PE.
In addition , he was treated for minor COPD exacerbation with
steroids and nebulizer but not antibiotics and was discharged on
5/10/05 at baseline home O2 of 2 liters and was afebrile. At
presentation on 9/30/05 , the patient noted worsening shortness
of breath with increasing oxygen needs and in the ED was found to
have a temperature of 102.4. On chest x-ray , the patient was
found to have left lower lobe pneumonia that had not been noted
on chest x-ray from 10/10/05 and on the PECT on 4/19/05 .  The
patient was admitted on 9/30/05 for pneumonia and increasing
oxygen requirements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Past medical history is notable for a. fib with SVT not on
Coumadin , hypertension , COPD with home oxygen at 2 liters ,
hyperlipidemia , gout , coronary vascular disease , chronic renal
insufficiency , and type II diabetes controlled on diet.
MEDICATIONS:
His medications at time of admission included aspirin 81 mg
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d. , the
patient was on the prednisone taper , Hytrin 2 mg daily , Zocor 40
mg q.h.s. , Flovent , Prilosec , and Atrovent.
ALLERGIES:
He has allergies to sulfa , lisinopril , and quinine causing
platelet deficiency.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient had quit cigarette and denied any alcohol or illicit
drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Physical exam at the time of admission was notable for a
temperature of 101 , blood pressure 95/53 , oxygen saturation of
86% on 2 liters , pulse of 96 , and respiratory rate of 24. The
patient was noted to have crackles with left side being greater
than right. His cardiovascular exam had normal S1 , S2 regular
rate and rhythm with no rubs , murmurs or gallops. His
extremities were notable for trace edema. Neurologically , he was
intact.
LABORATORY DATA:
His labs at time of admission was notable for a creatinine of
1.7 , and a white cell count of 16 , he had a ABG with pH of 7.42 ,
PaCO2 of 35 , PaO2 of 52 , and 89% oxygen saturation on 2 liters.
His EKG showed T wave inversions in V2-V3 , flat V4 , borderline
first-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray was notable
for left lower lobe pneumonia.
ASSESSMENT:
On assessment , this is a 73-year-old gentleman recently
discharged for minor COPD flare , presenting with acute hypoxemia
likely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia with COPD.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary:
a. Hypoxia: The patient presented with acute and chronic
hypoxia. The patient initially required short term MICU stay for
a BiPAP and was gradually weaned to facemask over 24 hours. On
day two of admission , he was weaned to 8 liters and was
transferred to the floor where his respiratory management was
continued. On 10/4/05 , day 3 of hospitalization , the patient
had been weaned to 5 liters when he began coughing and abruptly
desaturated to 70% oxygen saturation with complaints of shortness
of breath and chest pain and required nonrebreather. The patient
had no EKG changes and a chest x-ray was unchanged from prior on
9/30/05 .  The patient was given DuoNeb and chest PT. He was
stabilized and was able to be managed on the floor and
transitioned back to 8 liters. At time of discharge , he has been
weaned to 4 liters with 91-97% oxygen saturation. The patient
does continue to desaturate with activities and requires further
pulmonary rehabilitation including chest PT to remove mucus
plugging noted on CT PE from earlier hospitalization in April .
b. Pneumonia: The patient presented with left lower lobe
pneumonia. He was started on vancomycin , ceftriaxone , and
azithromycin on 9/30/05 .  He had a sputum culture positive for
MRSA and was therefore continued on vancomycin. He was briefly
transitioned to vancomycin with ceftazidime and Flagyl from
8/14/05 to 08 , but was switched back to vancomycin with
cefotaxime and azithromycin on 5/26/05 .  On day of discharge , he
will be leaving on vancomycin to complete two more days of
treatment for a total 10-day course. In addition , he will be
discharged on Levaquin for an additional seven-day course of
treatment for his pneumonia.
c. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and was
most recently discharged on 5/10/05 for mild COPD exacerbation
treated with DuoNeb and steroid taper. During this hospital
course , the patient continued on DuoNeb treatments as well as a
steroid taper. Given his acute clinical course in this
hospitalization , the patient did not have pulmonary function test
performed but with benefit from PFT studies as an outpatient. At
time of discharge , the patient is on 4 liters of oxygen and is
currently on prednisone 5 mg which will be tapered to his home
regimen of prednisone 5 mg every other day.
d. Hypertension: The patient had been noted to have a pulmonary
artery pressure in 2003 in the 60s but on this admission had an
echo at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary artery
pressure was now at 98 mmHg. The patient was followed by the
Insmotho Erout Hospital Service to assess his pulmonary hypertension.
The patient will be followed as an outpatient by the
Malv Medical Center Service and will likely need right heart
catheterization to assess his right heart function as well as his
pulmonary hypertension.
2. Cardiovascular:
a. Pump: The patient has congestive heart failure with
diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction around 60% as
noted on an echo done on 9/30/05 .  The patient initially had his
Lasix held due to his creatinine of 1.7 at time of admission.
However , given his acute respiratory status , as well as his
increasing edema during his hospital course , the patient was
again aggressively diuresed for his CHF exacerbation with Lasix.
At time of discharge , the patient still has trace edema and his
creatinine has remained at his baseline of 1.1-1.2. The patient
will be discharged on his home Lasix regimen of 40 mg p.o.
although he required IV Lasix on multiple occasions during his
hospital course.
b. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.
Overall , his systolic blood pressure remained in the range from
110-130s. The patient was on Lopressor during his hospital
course and had no acute issues regarding his hypertension.
c. Ischemia: The patient had been ruled out for MI with three
sets of negative cardiac biomarkers. He was continued on
telemetry and remained on a regimen of aspirin , beta blockers , as
well as statin during this hospital course.
d. Rate: The patient has a history of arrhythmias with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and SVTs. At last admission on
10/10/05 , the patient presented to the ED in SVT and hypotensive
and reverted back to normal sinus rhythm after one dose of IV
Lopressor. The patient was continued on Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d.
during his hospital course with his DuoNeb treatments. The
patient did occasionally have heart rate into the 140s consistent
with AV nodal reentry tachycardia. These incidences did not last
more than 2 minutes and the patient was in general asymptomatic
from these arrhythmias although did occasionally did complain of
some shortness of breath on occasion during these periods of
arrhythmia. The patient is being continued on Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes
that was under diet control as an outpatient with steroid
treatment for his COPD exacerbation. The patient did have his
blood glucose measured regularly three times a day and required a
regular insulin sliding scale for his steroid-induced diabetes.
With tapering of the steroids , the patient&apos;s blood glucose has
generally ranged between 100-150 and has required less insulin.
While the patient is on steroids , we will continue to monitor his
blood glucose level and cover with insulin as needed. The
patient will follow up with his primary care physician and
discuss further his overall need for oral hypoglycemic agents.
4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency with baseline creatinine around 1.1-1.2. At
initial time of presentation , his creatinine was 1.7 and his
Lasix had been held. However , the patient developed lower
extremity edema with shortness of breath and required Lasix for
his CHF exacerbation. His creatinine was followed closely during
his hospital course and with Lasix diureses his creatinine did
rise slowly to 1.4 , however , the benefits of diureses for CHF
exacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state.
We would recommend that the patient follow up with his primary
care physician to monitor his renal state.
5. FEN: During this hospital course , the patient&apos;s electrolytes
were monitored and repleted as needed. He had no acute issues
regarding his electrolytes or nutritional status. However , the
patient should continue on low-salt 2 g sodium diet as well as
limit his fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day.
6. ID: The patient , at initial time of admission , had a
temperature of 101.2 with white cell count as high as 16. He was
found on chest x-ray to have a left lower lobe pneumonia and was
started on a antibiotic course as dictated above in pulmonary.
The patient remained afebrile through the extent of this hospital
course while on the antibiotic therapy his sputum cultures were
positive for MRSA. At time of discharge , he will be continued on
his antibiotics on vancomycin for an additional two days for a
total of 10-day course and he will also be started on Levaquin
for a seven-day course. At time of discharge , the patient
remained afebrile with his white cell count of 12.6. The patient
is on prednisone , which can slightly his overall white cell
count. The patient is aware that if he had worsening of his
sputum production as well as fevers , to seek medical attention.
7. Heme: The patient had no active issues.
8. GI: The patient had regular bowel movements during his
hospital course and deferred bowel regimen. He was on proton
pump inhibitor for prophylaxis and would be continued on this as
an outpatient.
PROPHYLAXIS:
The patient received heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code.
DISPOSITION:
The patient will be discharged to rehab for further management of
his pneumonia as well as for pulmonary rehabilitation with
physical therapy.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Selkirk is a 49 year old woman with
history of non ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy thought to be either familial or secondary to
alcohol use who is on the transplant list and presents with
worsening CHF symptoms.
Ms. Ohlenbusch cardiac history began in 1995 when she was admitted
with worsening dyspnea. Echocardiogram at that time revealed an
ejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis and 3+ mitral
regurgitation. Catheterization revealed a right dominant system
with clean coronary arteries. Exercise test at that time revealed
a peak VO2 of 12.6 liters per kg per minute. IN October of 1997 , a
repeat echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with
moderate mitral regurgitation and significant left atrial
dilatation. At that time , she received tailored therapy with
Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In February of 1997 , she
was again hospitalized , this time with severe pancreatitis
resulting in acute renal failure , hypotension and respiratory
failure requiring intubation in the ICU. In April of 1997 , she
developed progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and PND. In
October of 1998 , repeat echocardiogram revealed severe left
ventricular dilatation with an EF of 10 to 15% , global hypokinesis
and left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation. She
was hospitalized most recently in August 1999 for abdominal
discomfort thought to be secondary to worsening right heart failure
and improved with aggressive diuresis.
She has done well since then until approximately three weeks prior
to admission when she developed worsening dyspnea and intermittent
tachycardia. She reports four pillow orthopnea and three nights of
PND. She becomes short of breath walking up only five stairs , and
reports approximately three weeks of a dry cough , productive
occasionally of clear sputum. She denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting or diarrhea , GI , or GU symptoms.

patient came off the heart-lung machine without any difficulty ,
on no pressors , and was taken to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive
Care Unit and extubated the following day. The patient&apos;s
postoperative course by systems.
Neurological: The patient remained intact and was started back
on Neurontin for her diabetic peripheral and autonomic
neuropathy. The patient also was restarted back on her
Wellbutrin for her depression.
Cardiovascular: The patient initially was in a sinus bradycardia
with a backup pacing wire , temporary pacing wire , and started on
low-dose beta-blockers; however , the patient had no further
bradycardia and her Lopressor was titrated up for discharge dose
of Toprol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and captopril for hypertension and
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
postoperative course.
Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative day #1 ,
and weaned to room air by postoperative day #4 with gentle
diuresis , and due to her preop CHF and EF of 38 , the patient will
be discharged on her preoperative doses of Lasix 40 mg p.o. once
a day , and should follow up with Dr. Thompon in 1-2 weeks to
further evaluate her Lasix requirement.
GI: The patient was on Nexium for GI prophylaxis , but on
discharge was switched over to her preoperative Protonix.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
her postoperative course with a discharge creatinine of 0.9 and
BUN of 24. Preoperatively , her creatinine was 1.3 with a
estimated clearance was 67.
Endocrine: The patient is an insulin-dependent diabetic and
required an insulin drip intraoperatively and transitioned to a
sliding scale followed closely by the Diabetes Service and will
be discharged on Lantus 22 units , as well as NovoLog with meals.
Heme: The patient had a stable hematocrit throughout her
postoperative course. She has been anywhere from the 23-25 , was
stable and on Niferex to boost her hematocrit , as well as Nexium
for GI prophylaxis while she is on the aspirin and Plavix status
post cardiac surgery instant.
ID: The patient was on vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis , but
had no other infectious issues postoperatively and will not be
discharged on any antibiotics. By postoperative day #8 , the
patient was in stable condition and will be transferred to the
rehabilitation center on these following medications.

ATTENDING: SOLTANI , LEON M.D.
SERVICE:
General Medicine Service Ri
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
OTHER PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS TREATED:
LGL NKA lymphoma with pancytopenia , type II diabetes ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , genital herpes , PICC
line infection , nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Seligson is an 88-year-old Italian-speaking female with a history
of large granulocytic lymphocyte lymphoma complicated by
pancytopenia with chronic transfusion requirement. She also has
a history of type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , and a
recent herpes infection undergoing treatment with famciclovir who
presented with fever , chills , cough , and decreased p.o. intake
from her nursing home with moderate hypotension to systolic
pressures of 80 at the nursing home as well as oxygen saturation
of 91% and on admission was found to have fever without
neutropenia later diagnosed with an MSSA bacteremia and a
component of acute on chronic renal failure.
ALLERGIES:
Fentanyl which caused GI intolerance , lisinopril which causes
cough , morphine which causes vomiting and Percocet which causes
nausea and vomiting.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature of 98.4 , a pulse of 100 , a BP of 143/64 with a
respiratory rate of 20 with a O2 saturation of 100% on 3 liters.
This is post 4 liters of IV fluids and six packs of platelets in
the emergency department at which point she had presented with a
fever to 101 with a initial systolic pressure of 146 over a
diastolic of 91 that had dropped to 100 systolic. In the ED , she
also received vancomycin , levofloxacin , Flagyl , and ceftazidime
as well her PICC line which is present in the right upper
extremity was pulled. A physical examination on admission was
significant for tachycardia with an otherwise normal cardiac exam
without murmurs. Her respiratory exam showed decreased air
movement bilaterally with expiratory wheezes , however , no
evidence of focal decrease in breath sounds. The abdominal exam
was benign and the extremities showed erythema and induration at
the right former PICC site.
ADMISSION LABORATORY:
Significant for sodium of 131 , potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of
20 , BUN and creatinine of 63/2.9 up from her baseline of 2. Her
white blood cell count on admission was 4.5 with a hematocrit of
23.7 and platelets of 20.
Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ blood , 1+ bacteria and 2-4 white
blood cells. An admission troponin was drawn and that was less
than assay.
Her EKG showed a sinus tachycardia with poor R-wave progression
and T-wave flattening in III and AVF. The chest x-ray was
performed on admission that showed right-sided subsegmental
basilar atelectasis with low lung volumes and a large cardiac
silhouette , but no definitive infiltrate or fusion.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
1/26/06: PICC line placement in the left upper extremity.
1/26/06: CAT scan of the chest.
2/3/06: Right upper extremity Doppler ultrasound and chest
x-rays were performed on 6/20/06 , 03 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
ID: Based on blood culture results the patient had an MSSA
bacteremia. She was initially treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics in the emergency department , however , this regimen
was tapered to initially include vancomycin as a single agent and
then further tapered to naphthalene but this was also tapered
finally to a regimen of Ancef dosed at 0.5 g IV q. 12h. Her last
positive blood culture was on 2/10/06 and the Ancef should be
continued for 14 days thereafter setting an end date of
approximately 5/2/06 .  She completed her course of famciclovir
during hospitalization and had no further evidence of genital
herpetic infection as well the urine culture and urinalysis data
described above showed yeast only and a Foley that had been
intermittently placed during the ED stay was discontinued , and
the patient remained asymptomatic for any further urinary tract
infection.
Cardiovascular: Although the patient initially had transient
hypertension believed to be secondary to infection and mild
hypovolemia in the setting of diuretics and poor p.o. intake
prior to coming in. She was electively fluid resuscitated and
actually went into mild hypervolemia as evidenced by chest x-ray
findings consistent with pulmonary edema initially. She was
thereafter diuresed as needed. During her hospitalization as her
hemodynamic status stabilized her home blood pressure regimen was
reinstated. However , the following substitutions were made. The
hydrochlorothiazide was substituted with Lasix as her chronic
renal insufficiency dictated as well as her doxazosin dose was
increased from 2 mg per day to 4 mg per day for better blood
pressure control. Her metoprolol dose , which was initially 100
mg twice a day was changed the 62.5 mg four times daily , which
can be converted as her blood pressure normalizes. Captopril and
ARBs were not used due to her history of allergies but additional
antihypertensive medications may be indicated if her pressure
remains elevated. During the hospitalization , she had evidence
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia asymptomatic on
telemetry , however , with alteration of the dose of Lopressor
there was no further evidence of this. At the time of discharge ,
she was euvolemic from a pulmonary standpoint with mild lower
extremity edema. He discharge weight is 71.1 kilograms and her
daily weights should be followed and the Lasix titrated to remain
euvolemic. There was no evidence of ischemia during the
hospitalization.
Pulmonary: Although she presented with some shortness of breath
and cough she did not continue to have any shortness of breath or
cough during the hospitalization. Due to complaints of right
posterior rib pain during the hospitalization without evidence of
any skin or soft tissue abnormalities she underwent a CT scan of
the chest on 5/5/06 , which showed a small right middle lobe
area of consolidation favoring atelectasis but not impossible to
represent an early pneumonia. They also had tiny pleural
effusions bilaterally as well as a tiny pericardial effusion , a
small calcified right apical node , and an enlarged left thyroid
lobe with extension below the sternum. There was no evidence of
rib fracture or soft tissue abnormality on this CAT scan in the
area of concern. The pain caused by this symptom , which is still
unclear was treated with Lidoderm patch as well as Tylenol 650 mg
p.o. q. 6h. standing with only modest relief. Other medications
including other narcotics and NSAIDS were not used given her
history of allergies as well as her thrombocytopenia. However ,
these can be further evaluated in the outpatient setting.
Hematology/oncology: The patient has a history of LGL NK
lymphoma. There is no inpatient treatment for this disease;
however , she received transfusions of packed red blood cells for
her hematocrit less than 22 and platelet scales were set as 10.
She also received GCSF during her hospitalization and should
receive her Neulasta in the outpatient setting. Prior to
discharge a left upper extremity PICC line was placed on 5/5/06
and confirmed on chest x-ray with its tip projecting over the
superior vena cava.
Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency
with a component of acute renal failure at the time of admission
as her baseline creatinine increased from 2 to 2.9 , however , her
creatinine returned to her baseline with IV hydration initially
and has remained at 1.9-2 stably prior to discharge.
Endocrine: This patient has a history of type II diabetes
initially managed on Glucotrol in the outpatient setting. She
was placed on NPH twice daily in the hospital and will be
discharged on 10 units twice daily with a insulin aspartate
sliding scale prior to meals. Her blood glucose is not optimally
controlled but more aggressive attempts to control her glucose
resulted in symptomatic hypoglycemia , therefore it was felt best
to air on the side of mildly elevated blood glucoses in the range
of 150 to the low 200s in order to avoid transient hypoglycemia.
The incidental finding of the left thyroid lobe enlargement on
the CT of the chest should be evaluated in the outpatient setting
and this may be done in collaboration with the endocrine service ,
however , the projection to the retrosternal space may preclude
most evaluation.
The patient was followed by physical therapy during the
hospitalization and will continue to have physical therapy in the
outpatient setting. There were no complications during the
hospitalization. Her physical examination at the time of
discharge reveals a temperature of 97.2 , heart rate of 71-93 , a
blood pressure of 130-150/57-80 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation of 96%-99% on room air with a lung exam showing
minimal bibasilar crackles. A cardiac exam with regular rate and
rhythm , S1 , S2 , no murmurs and abdominal exam showing obese
abdomen with ventral hernia but otherwise benign and lower
extremities with 1+ edema and nontender. A PICC line in the left
upper extremity and no erythema in the right upper extremity ,
however , resolving induration and minimal tenderness. Her
fingerstick glucose on the a.m. of discharge was 91. Her
discharge labs show a potassium of 4.2 , sodium of 136 , creatinine
of 2 , magnesium of 1.7 , which is repleted. A white blood cell
count of 1 , hematocrit of 22.5 , platelets of 13 with 1% polys ,
86% lymphs , and 4% monocytes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every six hours. This should be
continued standing until her right chest wall pain diminishes ,
Ben-Gay topical apply twice daily to back/right flank as
directed , Ancef 0.5 g IV q. 12h. should be continued until
5/2/06 , Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily , Lasix 40 mg by
mouth daily , insulin NPH 10 units subcutaneous b.i.d. , milk of
magnesia 30 ml by mouth daily as needed for constipation ,
Lopressor 62.5 mg by mouth four times daily , doxazosin 4 mg by
mouth daily , Lidoderm 5% patch may be applied daily as needed for
pain and it must have a 12 off period during the application ,
insulin aspartate sliding scale pre-meal , Maalox tablets ,
Spectazole one to two tablets by mouth every six hours as needed
for upset stomach and Protonix 40 mg by mouth daily.
She will be discharged to the Worth Ri and the
final results of the CT of the chest should be followed up. Dr.
Bernard Winge , her primary oncologist , has been notified of her
discharge and will continue to follow her in the outpatient
setting. The patient is full code and her healthcare proxy is
Rufus Kelderman , her son , at 468-946-1419.

Discharge Date: 10/11/2006
ATTENDING: KELLIHER , ASHLEY MD
SERVICE: General Medicine Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Altered mental status.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Altered mental status , metastatic
adenocarcinoma , diabetes type 2 , history of sarcoid by report ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of T9
through T12.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Malloch is a 51-year-old
woman with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary origin who presents as a transfer initially from Ons Hospital with altered mental status. The patient was initially
diagnosed with cancer and presenting with lower back pain in
5/15 when she was found to have lytic spinal and pelvic
lesions on MRI. Immunohistochemistry was most consistent with
pancreatic cancer origin. She was admitted to the Laso in early October for cord compression and
underwent XRT and laminectomy by orthopedic surgeon by Dr.
Kasey Mahaxay . During that admission , she was also noted to have
a large pericardial effusion and underwent pericardial window.
She was then discharged from Madei Coxcli Hospital on
7/20/06 to rehab. At rehab , the patient was noted to have
difficulties expressing herself and word finding at 01:00 a.m. on
the day of admission. Prior to this episode , she had normal
speech and mental status and it is pertinent to note that on the
day prior to admisison she had been seen in Oncology Clinic with
Dr. Randell Youkhana and hence was started on Zometa. The patient
denies any fevers , chills , neck stiffness or focal neurologic
symptoms. She was initially sent to Inh Hospital And Medical Center where a
noncontrast CT scan was done and found to be negative for an
acute process and was then admitted to General Service. At that
point , it had been over three hours since symptom onset and her
cancer further precluded any possible TPA therapy. An MRI was
then attempted to be obtained , however , the patient required
intravenous conscious sedation to attempt the MRI secondary to
agitation and anxiety. The patient received total of 2 mg of
Versed , 4.5 mg of IV Ativan and 2 mg of oral Ativan and several
attempts were made to facilitate the MRI. She was unable to sit
for MRI and was able to sit for a head CT with angiography. As
she became more and more somnolent , it was felt that additional
sedation might necessitate intubation. The Anesthesia Service
called and pointed out that the Mas MRI machine is
not compatible with intubated patients. The patient was then
transferred to Down Camp for possible MRI with
intubation. An LP at this time was also unable to be performed
secondary to her restlessness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic adenocarcinoma , diabetes
mellitus type 2 , history of sarcoid ( although never had a
biopsy ) , status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of
T9 , T11 and T12.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Lorazepam 0.5 mg q.3 h. p.r.n.
agitation , omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily , senna two tabs p.o.
b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , metoprolol SR 50 mg p.o. daily ,
ondansetron 8 mg p.o. b.i.d. , furosemide 20 mg p.o. daily ,
insulin sliding scale , insulin Humalog 6 units a.c. , insulin NPH
10 units b.i.d. , enoxaparin 40 mg daily subcutaneous , docusate
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , Tylenol 650 mg q.6 h.
p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin with an unknown reaction.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature of 98 degrees , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 107/51 , respirations 20 , sating 97% on 2 L.
General exam showed a drowsy-feeling patient who was oriented x1
( not for place or time ). HEENT exam shows pupils equal , round
and reactive with no photophobia. Neck exam showed a supple neck
with no lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary exam showed lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed a JVP that
was difficult to assess , heart rate showed a regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops , distal pulses were bilateral
and 2+ and symmetric. Abdominal exam showed an obese abdomen , is
nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities exam showed extremities warm and well perfused.
Neurologic exam showed the patient was alert and oriented only x1
with 2+ patellar reflexes , 2+ ankle reflexes and 1+ brachial
reflexes. The patient was poorly responsive to questions and
commands , hence a motor and sensory exam was unable to be
obtained , however , the patient was moving all extremities.
PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Included a negative tox screen ,
otherwise unremarkable. EKG showed sinus tach to 103 beats per
minute , slightly low voltage. Chest x-ray showed cardiac
enlargement without acute or active disease. Head CT showed no
acute intracranial abnormality noted. Urinalysis showed trace
leuk esterase , 5 to 10 white blood cells , 200 rbc&apos;s , however ,
urine culture showed no growth.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Neurologic: The patient was initially admitted to the
medical ICU for possible MRI with intubation. However , upon
arrival , the patient was alert and oriented enough to refuse the
MRI/MRA ( this was desired to rule out metastatic disease versus
leptomeningeal disease ). Because she did not require she was
then sent to the floor on 2/11/06 .  A full toxic metabolic
workup was obtained , which showed the ammonia levels within
normal limits and nonreactive RPR , B12 assay that was actually
slightly elevated and a TSH level of 10.6 ( a full thyroid panel
was also sent , which was pending at the time of discharge and
should be followed ). Given the concern for her slight pyuria on
her UA and her altered mental status she was also given a
three-day course of ciprofloxacin , however , her urinary culture
was negative. She presently , within the first 24 hours of her
stay on the floor , her mental status improved remarkably and was
at her baseline. Hence , an MRI/MRA was not performed , as this
would require the patient to undergo further sedation ( it was
felt that her significant amount of benzodiazepines that were
given previously only served to worsen her mental status ). An LP
was not indicated at this time since she had returned to her
baseline. An echo was ordered but was not performed secondary to
the fact that the patient had had a previous echo within the last
month , but was desired to rule the very small chance that she had
marantic endocarditis with embolic phenomenon. At the time of
discharge , the patient was at her neurologic baseline and was
alert and oriented x4. The likely source of her altered mental
status appears to be toxic metabolic multifactorial etiology ,
including the possibility of Zometa effect , the urinary tract
infection and possible hypothyroidism.
2. Onc: The patient has an appointment with Dr. Garrett Gavidia of
Shiresy Medical Center Oncology on 2/10/06 to initiate Gemzar
chemotherapy.
3. Ortho: The patient has a followup appointment with Dr. Maron
of Spi Medical Center Orthopedics on 8/9/06 for
further followup.
4. Endocrine: The patient will be discharged to rehab on a
regimen of Lantus and sliding scale insulin. She should have her
TFTs followed up as they are pending at this time for possible
initiation of hormone replacement.
5. ID: The patient finished a three-day course of ciprofloxacin
for possible urinary tract infection , however , her urinary
culture was negative.
6. Cardiovascular: The patient was initially transferred on
metoprolol , however , her blood pressures have been well
controlled in-house. If her blood pressures are elevated at
rehab , one could consider restarting her metoprolol.
7. Disposition: The patient was in stable condition and
discharged back to rehab for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Temperature of 98.6 , blood
pressure of 110/60 , heart rate 98 , respirations 18 , sating 99% on
room air. General exam shows a slightly obese female who is
alert and oriented x4 in no acute distress. Cardiovascular exam
shows a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Neck shows a supple neck with no JVD. Pulmonary exam shows
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam shows a
slightly obese abdomen that is nondistended and nontender with
good bowel sounds. Skin exam shows a midline back scar that is
healing well and nontender with no erythema. Extremity exam
shows no calf tenderness with trace edema.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Tessalon Perles 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
p.r.n. cough , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , guaifenesin 10 mL p.o.
q.6 h. p.r.n. cough , Lantus 20 units subcu q.p.m. , Insulin

ATTENDING: WEDD , ELLIOT MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Diabetes management and teaching.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Diabetes management and teaching.
ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Ms. In is a 32-year-old G6P2-0-3-2 at 22-6/7 weeks&apos; gestational
age admitted for blood sugar control after first prenatal visit
in Special OB Clinic. Her dating is by her last menstrual
period , which was 9/26/05 , giving her an estimated date of
confinement of 2/27/05 .  An ultrasound at 14 weeks done during
an ER admission for vaginal bleeding confirmed her gestational
age. Prenatal screen were not known at the time of admission.
HISTORY OF PRESENT PREGNANCY:
Ms. Horka had been scheduled to see a midwife at Do 1 but
had been unable to keep appointment. Her pregnancy thus far has
been notable for:
1. Late prenatal care.
2. Hypertension. She has had blood pressures that were
140&apos;s/90&apos;s several months prior to pregnancy. Her blood pressure
in clinic on the day of admission was 139/79.
3. Diabetes , likely type 2 , class B diabetic. Predates
pregnancy , per the patient her blood sugars prior to pregnancy
ranged from the 120-180 range and that she reports she has never
needed to take insulin. She had a visit at Til Dr. , Burg A Rill and was
given a glucometer and known fasting sugars ranged from the
90s-140s and one hour postprandials ranged from 140-230.
4. She is a smoker.
5. History of depression. She currently takes Remeron and is
followed by her outpatient psychiatrist with whom she has had a
longstanding relationship. Given that the Remeron was a class C
medication , she was discontinued on that.
HER PAST OB HISTORY:
She had three prior first trimester TABs and two priors
spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Her largest baby was 7 pounds 12
ounces.
GYN HISTORY:
She has a history of high-grade SIL , status post colpo with
biopsies. Her last Pap was a year ago and within normal limits.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Also , notable for a history of renal stones and migraine
headaches.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
She had laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS:
Her only medication is Remeron.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She smokes approximately seven cigarettes daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Her blood pressure is 139/79. She is well appearing. Her heart
was regular rate and rhythm. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and obese. It is
difficult to assess fundal height. Pelvic exam had normal
mucosa , normal cervix. Bimanual exam revealed approximately 22
weeks size uterus with audible fetal heart tones.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Diabetes: Given the late time in the day of her appointment
and the inability to establish proper diabetic teaching as an
outpatient , she was admitted for diabetic teaching and control.
She had never previously used medications and has had reportedly
poor control with diet. Risks of diabetes were discussed. She
was started on a regimen of 14 of N q.a.m. and 14 of N at bedtime
with 6 of Humalog premeal as per Dr. Haggett . Her sugars overnight
while in-house were as follows: 100 fasting , 175 approximately
two hours postprandial , 157 and then a fasting of 94 this is
while receiving that stated insulin regimen. She was seen by the
Diabetes Management Service and Dr. Saunders on 5/10/05 who
recommended increasing her prebreakfast and predinner Humalog to
8. She will need an Ophthalmology consult as an outpatient.
Hemoglobin A1c was sent and was 5.3.
2. Hypertension: Given her elevated blood pressure of 139/79 in
clinic and her history that was notable for potentially a
longstanding hypertension , her blood pressure was monitored
closely and baseline preeclampsia labs were sent. Her blood
pressure overnight was within normal limits with values this
morning of 108/60 seated and 90/50 lying. She had a normal BUN ,
creatinine , ALT , AST , and uric acid. A 24-hour urine protein was
completed during this hospitalization and the results are pending
at the time of this dictation.
3. History of depression: Her Remeron was discontinued and I
discussed her symptoms of depression with her in greater detail.
She said that she primarily uses Remeron as a sleep aid and the
major side effect she experiences with withdrawal of Remeron is
nightmares. She does not feel as if she has a problem with
depression and declined a psychiatry consultation while in the
hospital. She has an outpatient psychiatrist whom she has a
longstanding relationship with. I advised to discuss her
pregnancy with her psychiatrist and to be in contact should she
have any concerns. She reported that she always knows if she
needs additional help and will be in contact with her doctor.
4. Fetal well-being: Baseline and prenatal laboratories were
sent on 4/19/05 .  Her blood type is B positive. Her antibody
screen was negative. Her RPR was nonreactive. Her hepatitis B
surface antigen is negative , rubella immune , gonorrhea and
chlamydia are negative. She had an ultrasound done on the
5/10/05 which revealed a singleton intrauterine gestation. Her
placenta was posterior and not previa. She had normal Dopplers
and normal fetal survey. The fetal risks of uncontrolled
diabetes were discussed and she expressed that she understood all
of these concerns.
5. Cardiac. A baseline EKG was obtained which revealed normal
sinus rhythm , normal axis , normal rate , however , her QT-interval
was slightly prolonged at 491 msec. The upper limit of normal in
women is 460. I briefly discussed this finding with the Medicine
Consult Service and Cardiology Service who felt that this is
likely attributable to her low potassium of 3.2. Therefore , high
content potassium foods were encouraged and she will have a
repeat EKG at her prenatal visit next week to evaluate for
resolution of this prolonged QT. Of note , she reports that her
mother had a congenital heart condition and experienced her first
heart attack at the age of 27 due to what she thought was an
enlarged heart. Her mother ultimately died at the age of 56 from
a heart attack. She reports aside from her mom who she does feel
had this condition since birth; no one in her family has
experienced sudden cardiac death. She also has never experienced
palpitations or chest pain.
6. History of kidney stones. A urinalysis was sent which
revealed 1-5 red blood cells and the urine culture showed 10 , 000
of mixed flora.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Given Ms. Bruechert strong desire to be discharged after only a day
of admission , she was discharged to home with the following
instructions:
She is to take her fingerstick blood sugars fasting and at one
hour postprandial intervals and record them prior to her
follow-up appointment. She is also instructed to eat foods high
in potassium and to call the office in an urgent manner should
she develop chest pain or palpitations. She has appointments
scheduled for 6/6/04 with Dr. Gettys in special OB Clinic ,
Dr. Weisse in Endocrine Clinic and Nutrition. She was given
prescriptions for NPH to take 14 units subcu a.m. and 14 units
subcu at bedtime and Humalog 8 units prebreakfast , 6 units
prelunch , and 8 units predinner. She is also advised to take
prenatal vitamins one tablet p.o. daily. She understands all
these follow up plans and has no concerns with her discharge at
this time.

6/10/2006 to 05 for a CHF exacerbation. During the
previous admission , she had been diuresed with a Lasix drip and
then started on amiodarone and Coumadin for a new paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. After discharge , she presented to NSCHC
Cardiology Clinic on 1/16/2006 with a jugular venous pressure at
15 cm and severe bilateral lower extremity edema and a BNP of
2500. The assessment in clinic was that she had been under
diuresed in the previous admission and therefore she was directly
admitted to Poredtiesbarre General Hospital for reinitiation of aggressive
diuresis. Of note , the patient had recently changed from Lasix
to torsemide after the last discharge as her outpatient
medication. She endorsed worsened orthopnea , dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as early satiety.
She denied any chest pain or other anginal equivalents.

ALLERGIES: Lisinopril and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with
her husband. She quit tobacco with rare alcohol use and no
drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. There is no family history of
cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 98.9 , heart
rate 70 , blood pressure 104/50 , respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen
saturation 95% on room air. In general , the patient was
comfortable in no acute distress. HEENT , Pupils were equal ,
round , and reactive. Oropharynx was clear. The JVP was greater
than 15 cm , chest exam showed bilateral crackles at the bases
with bibasilar dullness well as well as right greater than left
base. Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm with a S3 and
no murmur. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended with a
nonpulsatile liver. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema
bilaterally to the hips with bilateral changes of arterial and
venous insufficiency. Laboratory studies were significant for an
INR of 1.6 , BUN of 110 , creatinine 3 , white blood cell count of
11.7 and a hematocrit of 27.9.
EKG on admission was a normal sinus rhythm with evidence of a
previous anterior MI with lateral repolarization , ST and T wave
abnormalities , and possible LVH.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions , left greater than right
with increased vascular markings and fluid in the right fissure ,
but no discrete infiltrates.
IMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old woman with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , coronary artery disease status
post MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease ,
chronic renal insufficiency who presented in volume overload
after a recent admission with insufficient diuresis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular. In terms of pump , the patient was clearly in
gross volume overload from both the right sided and left-sided
failure on presentation. Her blood pressure was stable and she
had no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organ
perfusion. She was started on the Lasix drip at 10 mg per hour
and Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily. Her Lopressor was held for a
decompensated heart failure. She initially diuresed well
overnight; however , on the second day her diuresis tapered off
and her Lasix drip was turned up to 20 mg per hour and the
Zaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. She met her I&amp;O goal of
greater than 1 liter negative overnight the following night ,
however , a day later , she again had poor diuresis and the
Zaroxolyn was changed to Diuril. At this time , a repeat chest
x-ray showed a very little change in her bilateral pleural
effusions , so her diuresis up to this point was felt to be
insufficient. After the transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril ,
which was given 250 mg IV b.i.d. , she was noted to have an
increase in creatinine from 2.9. gradually up to 3.2; however ,
remained stable for the next few days and the patient was able to
maintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her
creatinine.
On 4/25/2006 , she was noted to have greatly improved lower
extremity edema and that improved lung exam and she had met her
goal weight of less than 85 kilograms. Lasix drip was
discontinued in the afternoon on 4/25/2006 and she was restarted
on her home p.o. torsemide regimen of 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50
mg p.o. q.p.m. for anticipated discharge home on 8/13/2006 .  The
Diuril was also discontinued. The patient was anticipated to be
stable on b.i.d. torsemide and p.o. on metolazone at home. Her
new dry weight on this admission was established at 85 kilograms
and this should be at a goal for diuresis should she require
admission in the future.
She will follow up with her CSH cardiologist for further
monitoring of her volume status after discharge. In terms of
rhythm , the patient had a new presentation of atrial fibrillation
on the prior admission and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin
at that time. She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at
this admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the
admission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events.
She was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and continued on
Coumadin; however despite the dose being decreased from her home
dose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m. , her INR continued to rise
and was eventually 3.5. Her Coumadin was discontinued. She was
recommended to be discharged off Coumadin and follow up with her
primary care provider during the week following discharge to
recheck her INR and restart her Coumadin when it falls below 2.5.
In terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence of
ischemia on presentation. Denied any chest pain and had no
changes consistent with ischemia on her EKG. She was continued
on aspirin and Lipitor throughout the admission.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency at
baseline. Her creatinine did increase from a baseline of 2.9 to
3.2. During this admission , however , remained stable after that
point. She continued on renally-dosed medications and actually
required repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite her
renal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting of
aggressive diuresis. Her electrolytes were stable prior to
discharge home. She was followed by the LCH Renal Clinic with
whom she has had a previous conversations about the possibility
of hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after
this discharge:
3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateral
pleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. This was all
felt to be consistent with her heart failure. She did have no
signs or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging or
as a part of her clinical picture. Her dyspnea on exertion and
her lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis.
4. Endocrine: The patient had erratic fingersticks early in the
admission with a very low fingerstick blood glucoses in the
morning initially , so her p.m. Lantus dose was decreased from 18
units to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started.
On 11/10/2006 , she was noted to continue to have lower sugars in
the morning , but routinely elevated sugars in the afternoon
greater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen.
However , on this regimen , she was found 1 morning to have a
fingerstick blood glucose of 33 and to be hypothermic with a
temperature of 94 taken rectally. This was thought to be
secondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over several
hours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normal
at 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. It was
felt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of her
injected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so ,
her Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbside
consultation with the diabetes management service. She will be
discharged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply
with a decreased Lantus dose down to 12 units nightly. She
should continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucoses at
home. We were hesitant to change the types or timing of her
insulin during this hospitalization. I left that item to be
further managed by her primary care provider after discharge:
5. Hematologic: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia
felt likely to be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency.
Her iron studies were rechecked on this admission and her iron
studies were also normal. She was continued on Aranesp through
this hospitalization and she is on Procrit as an outpatient and
she will continue on that with further discussion with the GGVH
Renal Clinic after she is discharged.
6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was fluid
restricted to 2 liters of fluid per day p.o. and potassium and
magnesium were repleted as needed and she was maintained on a
cardiac diet. Prophylaxis was with Coumadin and Nexium.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services for some home physical therapy. She will follow up with
her primary care provider Dr. Bublitz at MHS and also with the
SRRH Cardiology Clinic and Renal Clinic. She should have her INR
checked within 4-5 days after discharge and her Coumadin
restarted when her INR is less than 2.5.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
3. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.
4. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.
5. Lantus insulin 12 units subcutaneous nightly.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7. Metolazone 2.5 mg p.o. daily as needed for fluid retention as
directed by your physician.
8. Multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily.
9. Torsemide 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. at 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.
10. Vitamin B12.
11. Iron.
12. Procrit 40 , 000 units subcutaneously every other week.

ATTENDING: MANCHE , EARLE MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Dyspnea on exertion.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF.
2. Stage IV esophageal cancer.
PRESENTING SYMPTOMS:
Mr. Kanaan is a 68-year-old gentleman with stage IV esophageal
cancer who was two weeks status post his third cycle of
chemotherapy for his cancer. He also had ischemic cardiomyopathy
with a known ejection of 20% and coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1993. He presented with progressive shortness of
breath over the three days prior to admission. He denied any
fever. However , he did note increase in his weight and increased
lower extremity edema over the last week. He has three-pillow
orthopnea at baseline , but has been sleeping both upright for the
three days prior to admission. Two weeks prior to admission , he
was walking in the mall and was able to accomplish all of his
ADLs without difficulty. On admission , he was unable to walk
more than 20 feet without becoming severely dyspneic. He does
describe having diminished appetite , increased fatigue , and three
days of copious watery stool , possibly related to his
chemotherapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for pneumonia two weeks ago treated as an outpatient ,
esophageal cancer stage IV status post chemo x3 cycles ,
obstructive sleep apnea , ischemic cardiomyopathy , COPD , atrial
fibrillation status post pacemaker and AICD placement , gout ,
pulmonary vasculitis , and also CAD.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
Include amiodarone , digoxin , colchicine , Atrovent , lisinopril ,
spironolactone , torsemide , Ativan , Zocor , and Prilosec.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives at home and denies alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile with the temperature of 95.8. His heart
rate was in the 90s. His blood pressure was 90/60 breathing at a
rate of 22. His room air oxygenation was 82% , but increased to
98% on 3 liters nasal cannula. He was slightly uncomfortable
sitting straight up in bed and visibly tachypnic. His lung exam
demonstrated bilateral scattered wheezes throughout the lung
fields and bibasilar crackles. His JVP was approximately 15 cm.
Heart exam reveled regular rate and rhythm with prominent S3.
Abdominal exam was nontender. His extremities had 2+ pitting
edema to the knees.
PERTINENT LABS:
On admission , he had a creatinine of 1.7 , which is at his
baseline and BUN of 46. His BNP was 2960 , CK 48 , CK-MB 1.0 , and
troponin 0.1. Hematocrit 44.5 , white count 7.8 , and D-dimer was
150. His INR was 1.3.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a palliative esophageal stent placed on 4/5/05 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient presented with exam and labs
findings consistent with decompensated heart failure. For this ,
he had a known ejection fraction of 20%. While he was in the
hospital , he had strict I&apos;s and O&apos;s and was diuresed with Lasix
and torsemide. His diureses was somewhat limited by systolic
blood pressure with a range of 85 to 110 during his
hospitalization. On discharge , his weight was down to 82.1 kg
and was down from 87.5 on admission. The patient did have slight
leak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG was
unchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for the
troponin , which did not trend to higher. His cardiac medical
regimen was maximized with an ACE inhibitor or statin and baby
aspirin was started on him. He was discharged home on torsemide
100 mg daily in addition to his spironolactone dose.
2. Pulmonary: The patient received Atrovent nebulizers in-house
to help with his shortness of breath. His primary etiology ,
however , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart
failure. His diuresis goal of 1.5 liter a day was achieved with
the combination of dopamine , nesiritide , and Lasix drips. He was
most responsive to combination of nesiritide and dopamine. At
the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s room air saturations were
94% with ambulatory saturations of 86%. He was therefore
discharged home with oxygen to use overnight and when
symptomatic.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrhea
that was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has been
completed two weeks earlier. Stool was sent out for C.
difficile , which was negative. His colchicine was initially held
because of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flare
of his gout in his right great toe. Colchicine was resumed to
treat this with good results. The patient received palliative
stent to his esophagus on 4/5/05 that is placed by Dr. Cap
without complications. The patient had plans to follow up with
is outpatient oncologist for ongoing care of his esophageal
cancer after discharge.
4. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine was 1.7. His baseline
chronic renal insufficiency was with the creatinine of
approximately 1.3 to 1.5. At discharge , his creatinine was 1.6 ,
which has been stable throughout his entire stay. He briefly
required having a Foley catheter placed on 4/4/05 because of
urinary retention , but it was removed the next day without
difficulty and did not have problems with voiding prior to
discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient was placed on DVT prophylaxis with
Lovenox. He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronounced
than his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his gout
in his right great toe.
The patient was discharged to home with services and PT was
arranged to go and do a home safety evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:
The patient&apos;s vital signs were stable. He was resting
comfortably in bed. Crackles in his lungs were notably
diminished from admission. He no longer was tachypnic. His
heart had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , occasional S3. No
murmurs. Abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities had
trace pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg daily.
2. Colchicine 0.6 mg every other day.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.
5. Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg b.i.d.
7. Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
8. Trazodone 50 mg at night.
9. Multivitamins one tablet daily.
10. Torsemide 100 mg daily.
11. Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d.
12. Simvastatin 80 mg at night.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged to home with services. He had
instructions to follow up with his primary care doctor , Dr.
Keltt in one weeks&apos; time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 4/5/06 to the Cardiology Service
for cardiac workup including an echo and cardiac catheterization
and referred for surgical vascularization and was taken to the
operating room on 2/10/06 and underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting x3 with a LIMA to the LAD , a saphenous vein graft to the

throughout his postoperative course. The patient with his prior
history presenting with syncopal episode was evaluated by the
Electrophysiology Service , and with his past history of
nonsustained VT , the patient underwent EP studies to evaluate if
needed a permanent pacer or ICD. The patient was taken down to
their suite and found to have normal HV as well as sinus node.
There was no inducible atrial or ventricular arrhythmias , and no
VA conduction on baseline , and felt that he had normal studies
and did not require any pacer or ICD , and will be just discharged
on some beta-blocker.

immediate postoperative period , but the patient was autodiuresing
on his own quite well , and by postoperative day #2 , Lasix was
discontinued , and throughout his postoperative course , the
patient had a stable BUN and creatinine.
6. Endocrine: The patient was just on oral agents for his
diabetes and required some insulin drip perioperatively , but by
day of discharge , the patient was back on his preoperative
glipizide and will not be discharged on any insulin.
7. Heme: The patient had a stable hematocrit , did not require
any transfusion , and discharged with a hematocrit of 32.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , IN-STENT
RESTENOSIS
PROBLEM LIST: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
2. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Segonia is a 53-year-old female
with a cardiac history as follows. In
October of 2001 she presented with substernal chest pain and had a
positive exercise tolerance test. Cardiac catheterization at
Tormor Community Hospital revealed a 40% LAD , 50% left circumflex ,
80% RCA , and 90% RCA. Stents were placed to both the proximal and
mid RCA lesions. In August of 2001 , the patient represented with
substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test.
Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis. She was
treated with angioplasty and brachytherapy. In July of 2002 , she
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization for recurrent angina and
was again found to have in-stent restenosis. Again , she underwent
a angioplasty to zero percent. Later in July of 2002 , she
presented with chest pain; however , cardiac catheterization
revealed no significant stenosis. Finally , in September of 2002 , the
patient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponin
I of 0.15. MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiac
catheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis. She underwent
PTCA without stenting.
Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharp
chest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior to
admission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Her
symptoms were intermittent until the day of presentation when she
experienced 10/10 chest pain that was only partially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and was associated with shortness of
breath. She presented to Vic Storgre Hospital Emergency Department
where she was given aspirin 225 mg , nitroglycerin sublingually
x one , and Plavix 75 mg x one. On presentation , her blood pressure
was 98/54 and she was given one bolus of heparin 5 , 000 units.
While in the Emergency Room she had recurrent pain and was started
on intravenous nitroglycerin.

longer present.
HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted for
cardiac catheterization on 5/6/02 , which
revealed a 90% in-stent restenosis of the RCA stent. No
intervention was made at that time. Post cardiac catheterization
she was kept on Plavix , aspirin , atenolol , Zestril , lipitor , and
intravenous TNG. Because of recurrent chest pain on 8/11/02 she
was restarted on heparin. There was an attempt to wean both the
intravenous TNG and heparin on 9/4/02 with a planned transition to
p.o. Isordil. However , the patient again had chest pain at rest ,
leading to restarting of a heparin drip and intravenous TNG. There
were no EKG changes at that time and the pain was relieved by
nitroglycerin. Of note , the patient did have a small hematoma and
bruit at the right femoral artery catheterization site. Ultrasound
of the groin on 9/4/02 was negative for pseudoaneurysm. Because
of recurrent in-stent stenosis , the patient is planning to be

Discharge Date: 8/30/2006
ATTENDING: CZACHOR , FREDDY MD , MBA
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
The diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is pleural
effusions.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of congestive
heart failure , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation ,
chronic renal insufficiency , and non-small cell carcinoma of the
left lung , status post resection in 1997. He presents with
shortness of breath. He lives in a nursing home and was
diagnosed with pneumonia more than three weeks prior to
admission. The pneumonia , per report , was bilateral , left
greater than right. He was started on a 10-day course of
levofloxacin , which he completed. He subsequently developed C.
diff colitis and was treated with Flagyl. Three days prior to
the present admission , he noticing increased shortness of breath ,
worsened with any movement in bed. A chest x-ray at the nursing
home reportedly showed an increased opacity in the right lower
base , concerning for recurrent pneumonia. For this , he was
restarted on levofloxacin. On the day of admission , his oxygen
saturation dropped to 77% on room air , with improvement to the
mid 90&apos;s on 3 liters of oxygen. He noted a mild dry cough. Her
denied headache , dizziness , chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal
discomfort , or dysuria. His son reported that he has mild
orthopnea at baseline , unchanged in recent days. Notably , he was
admitted to the Sho Hospital in 5/23 for subacute shortness of
breath , thought to be due to a CHF exacerbation , treated with
Lasix diuresis. An echocardiogram at that time showed an
ejection fraction of 55% , with mild left atrial enlargement , and
mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , along with
inferobasal wall hypokinesis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

is a neurologist. He smoked cigars for many years , currently a
nonsmoker. Her denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for a father with diabetes and a brother with heart
disease.
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Shortness of breath: The patient initially presented with
shortness of breath , saturating 77% on room air. He was noted on
chest x-ray to have moderate bilateral effusions. The effusions
were likely secondary to congestive heart failure , although
pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions could not be excluded.
Given that he was afebrile with a decreasing white count and not
increasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusions were considered
less likely compared to worsening CHF. Given the concern for
CHF , he was given Lasix 40 mg IV approximately one to two doses a
day for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balance
of 2 liters negative per day. Over the course of his
hospitalization , his bilateral effusions improved , although there
were small effusions noted on the chest x-ray at the time of
discharge. His oxygen requirement decreased , and on the day of
discharge , he was saturating 97-98% on 1 liter. Of note , the
patient was brought to ultrasound for a planned guided
thoracocentesis , but the effusion sites were small such that in
the context of this clinical improvement , thoracocentesis was
deferred. He was maintained initially as well with vancomycin
and levofloxacin , although the vancomycin was discontinued after
four days , and the levofloxacin was discontinued on discharge ( of
note , he received 10 days total of levofloxacin starting from
3/27/2006 at his nursing home ). Echocardiogram noted an
ejection fraction of 55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy ,
consistent with diastolic dysfunction. The etiology of his
congestive heart failure and pleural effusions was therefore
thought to be atrial fibrillation with RVR. In terms of follow
up , he needs daily weights; if he gains greater than 2 pounds
over 24 hours , it is recommended that his Lasix dose be doubled
for that day. As a discharge , he is being sent out on Lasix 40
mg p.o. daily.
2. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient initially had a small troponin leak
0.32 , which was thought secondary to demand ischemia from atrial
fibrillation with RVR. For this , he was briefly started on a
heparin drip. Subsequently , cardiac enzymes trended down. The
patient was maintained on Coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along with
Zocor and Questran for hyperlipidemia. On hospital day #3 to #4 ,
telemetry noted pauses. EKG showed in addition to pausing , new
T-wave inversions in anterior precordial leads , associated with
ST depression. This is thought to be either due to ischemia or
digitalis toxicity. His digoxin levels measured 1.3 to 1.4 , so
digoxin was held , with improving in pausing , but no change in
T-wave inversions. In discussions with his outpatient
cardiologist , it was thought that his T-wave inversions could
possible be ischemic , although the appropriate course of action
was not to pursue further anticoagulation or evaluation for
catheterization , given the patient&apos;s other medical issues. He
was maintained on Coumadin , aspirin , Zocor , Questran , and
Lopressor.
b. Rhythm: The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation
throughout his hospitalization and was rate controlled with
Lopressor 37.5 mg t.i.d. ( increased from a home dose of 25 mg
t.i.d. ). He was also maintained on Coumadin 2 mg daily for
anticoagulation. On admission , there was a report that he had
runs of ventricular tachycardia and he was placed on a lidocaine
drip for several hours in the emergency department. No
documentation regarding telemetry strips or QRS morphologies
could be obtained to verify this rhythm , however. In addition ,
throughout his hospitalization , he had occasional runs
nonsustained VT and SVT. As discussed above , he was thought to
have mild digoxin toxicity given pausing with a digoxin level of
1.3 to 1.4. His digoxin was therefore held and subsequent
improvement in pausing was noted. Of note , on discharge , his
digoxin has been discontinued. His primary care physician and
cardiologist should consider whether or not to restart digoxin as
an outpatient.
c. Pump: The patient was aggressively diuresed with 40 mg IV of
Lasix approximately one to two times per day , for a total
diuresis of roughly negative 9 liters over the course of his
hospitalization. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy , consistent with
diastolic dysfunction. As discussed above , he will be discharged
on Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily. Note , as mentioned above , if he gains
greater than 2 pounds over a 24-hour period , his Lasix dose
should be doubled for that day.
3. C. diff: The patient had a positive C. diff as an inpatient.
He had been on Flagyl , which was started at the nursing home for
a prior diagnosis of C. diff. Because of persistent bowel
movements , he was switched to p.o. vancomycin 250 mg q.i.d. , and
upon discharge , he was started on a probiotic ( Saccharomyces
boulardii 250 mg q.i.d. ) to replenish his gut flora. We will
recommend that he continue p.o. vancomycin and the probiotic for
10 days after his diarrheal symptoms have resolved. If these
symptoms do not improve on the regimen within the few days
following discharge from Wood Rehab , we will recommend consider
adding metronidazole IV and getting an infectious disease
consult.
4. Diabetes: The patient had several bouts of hypoglycemia
during the course of his hospitalization. These were appeared to
be related to poor p.o. intake. His Lantus was changed to 15
daily , and he was covered with a NovoLog sliding scale. After
the changes , his fingersticks ranged in mid 100&apos;s.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient&apos;s TSH was low with a normal free
T4 suggestive of sick euthyroid. He was continued on Synthroid
25 mcg daily.
6. Musculoskeletal: Given the patient&apos;s creatinine clearance of
less than 50 , his colchicine dose for gout was switched from 0.6
mg b.i.d. to 0.6 mg daily. We continued his Neurontin for
neuropathic pain , and Tylenol for right knee osteoarthritis. He
was seen by Plastic Surgery registered nurse who recommended
Panafil with dressing for his right heel ulcer. He also has a
small ulcer developing on his left big toe , which will need close
observation as follow up.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n. for headache , aspirin 81 mg
daily , Questran 4 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily , Nexium 20 mg
daily , Lasix 40 mg daily , Neurontin 100 mg q.a.m. and 200 mg
q.p.m. , Lantus 15 units subq at bedtime , Synthroid 25 mcg p.o.

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: On January , 2005 , Dr. Leslie did a
Girdlestone on May , 2005. Dr. Hepp , a left hip
hemiarthroplasty. Please see a full dictated operative notes for
details.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She is a 76-year-old female with atrial
fibrillation , dementia , and presenting with a left hip fracture
for orthopedic surgical correction on June , 2005. She had
a surgery but without complication and a postoperative course
complicated by delirium , atrial fibrillation with RVR , and new
hyponatremia.
1. Ortho: She presented with left femur hairline fracture. She
had a Girdlestone procedure performed and a left hemiarthroplasty
performed without complications. She was treated postoperatively
with cefazolin and has been discharged will be discharged on
Keflex. She developed a mild incisional cellulitis with no signs
of abscess and no fever.
2. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: She was screened preop in the determined
intermediate risk. She was given a beta-blocker for surgery and
has no signs of symptoms of ischemia throughout this
hospitalization.
B. Pump: The patient was found to be mildly hypertensive and
was started on lisinopril with good control.
C. Rhythm: The patient with known atrial fibrillation. She
developed a rapid ventricular response on postoperative day #3.
Heart rates in the 140s. Blood pressure was stable. This was
difficulty to control with IV and p.o. beta-blocker , calcium
channel blockers , and digoxin so she was IV amiodarone loaded and
is currently undergoing a p.o. amiodarone load as well. To date
on January , 2005 , she has had seven days of p.o. 400 mg t.i.d.
and with current loading plan is seven more days of 400 mg
amiodarone b.i.d. followed by 400 mg q.d. indefinitely. She is
currently weight controlled. Heart rates in the mid to low 60s.
She is getting amiodarone and Toprol-XL 300.
3. Neurology: The patient has baseline dementia and per husband
was developing delirium prior to transfer to Bingvent Medical Center .  Differential diagnosis of this delirium infection
versus medications versus electrolytes. This is also complicated
by stress of surgery. Psychiatry was consulted , and initially
she was restarted on her Cymbalta. However , this was stopped
development of hyponatremia. Postoperatively , the patient has
slowly improved in terms of mental status and this new baseline
at discharge.
4. Infectious Disease: The patient has been afebrile
throughout. There was a report of a Gram-negative UTI at the
outside hospital for which she received a course of Levaquin.
She received postop prophylaxis of cefazolin until the September , 2005 , when this was stopped. Subsequently , she had increased
her white blood cell count to 23 , but no fever. UA , chest x-ray ,
and stool for C. diff was sent and are all negative to date. Her
white count has subsequently come down to 17 on the day of
discharge , and she has remained afebrile. Keflex was restarted
given the possible incisional site mild cellulitis , and she to be
continued until the staples were out after seven days course with
improvement. The patient developed a nonbloody diarrhea on
May , 2005. C. difficile studies were sent and have come
back negative to date. She was started on prophylactic dose of
Flagyl , which will be discontinued prior to discharge.
5. Pulmonary: The patient developed pleural effusion postop but
never was compromised in terms of oxygenation or ventilation.
She is making modest improvement at discharge and was self
diuresing.
6. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: On admission , the
patient had a sodium of 140 which seems to gradually dropped to
her course to a nadir of 119 on the November , 2005. No obvious
med changes except for the SSRI that was subsequently stopped.
She was started on free-water restriction and urine lytes were
drawn. These lytes were consistent with picture of SIADH , so
free-water restriction has worked. On the day of discharge , her
sodium is 131 , and she should be continued on free-water
restriction and recheck in a week. Otherwise , electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n. The patient was given a low fat ADA diet.
7. Endocrine. The patient&apos;s sugars are moderately well
controlled on regular insulin sliding scale. NPH insulin was
added and has been titrated up to 12 units q.a.m. with regular
insulin sliding scale for coverage on top of that. The patient
with known hypothyroidism was euthyroid on admission. TSH was
within normal limit. Her home dose Synthroid continued and
should be indefinitely.
8. Hematology: Given the patient atrial fibrillation , she had
been on Coumadin at the outside hospital; however , on
presentation , her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2. She was put on
Lovenox prophylactic dose prior to the surgery , and following
surgery Coumadin was restarted and up titrated to 30 range. On
discharge , she was therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 , Coumadin dose
of 5 mg q.h.s. Her hematocrit has fell following the surgery ,
and she has transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells on
May , 2005. Since then , her hematocrit has increased
appropriately and she has been stable throughout her rest of
admission. On discharge , the hematocrit was 39.0.
9. Prophylaxis: Given her high risk for DVTs , the patient was
prophylactic with Lovenox while waiting for her INR to become
therapeutic. She also given pneumo boots and TED stocking.
Finally , she was given Nexium for peptic ulcer disease
prophylaxis. No consultants were called; however , the orthopedic
service initial have this patient contact would be Dr. Scott E Kercy .
At discharge , she is afebrile , T max of 97.9 , pulse between 49
and 64 , blood pressure between 98 and 120/44 to 60. She is
breathing 18 times per minute and satting between 94% and 98% on
room air. Fasting sugars have been well controlled. On exam ,
she is in no apparent distress. She is alert and oriented x2 to
place and person but not the time. She is also alert to her
situation. HEENT: Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.
She has anicteric sclerae. Chest exam , she has slightly
decreased breath sounds at the right base but no crackles or
wheezes. Cardiovascular: She has irregularly irregular S1 and
S2. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen: Soft and obese with
mildly distended positive bowel sounds , nontender. Extremities:
Warm and well perfused. She has left hip incision with staples
with no signs of dehiscence but a 5 cm round area of erythema
which is nontender. Neuro exam is nonfocal.

HPI: 58 y/o women with h/o CAD , s/p MI w/ LAD stent 2004 , HTN ,
hyperlipdemia , complex PMHX admitted with 1 day h/o SSCP. Pt has had
multiple admissions and ED visits ( approx &gt; 10 ) for chest
pain over the past several months since April .  Her most recent
cardiac work-up includes a MIBI ( 11/5/06 ) which demonstrated a mild
small fixed perfusion defect in inferior-basal region - likely
representing soft tissue attenuation and a CTA which is negative for
aortic dissection in 6/26/06 .  Pt was in her USOH until several days
PTA when she developed occ palpitations. At 5PM of the
evening of admission she developed lightheadedness and ringing in her
ears and subsequently developed SSCP radiation to her back and
bilateral shoulders and left arm. + SOB. Chest pain intensity 10/10
and similar to pain of prior MI and similar to mult prior visits.
EMS called and pt given SL NTG without relief. Pain lasted approc 2
hours and was ultimately relived with morphine in the ED. In
addition , pt report a recent bilateral lower ext cellulites treated
with 7days of levo. Pt continues to have some warmth and erythema in
her bilateral lower ext. Last admit here 6/10 w/ EGD
confirming gastro-jejunal anastamotic ulcer - told to hold ASA and

recent admission for shortness of breath and fluid overload
complicated by PE while anticoagulated leading to a pulseless
electrical activity. The patient was also admitted to DHC from
5/15/06 to 07 for respiratory distress again with fluid
overload requiring diuresis. The patient was discharged to the

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Vital signs stable. Cardiac ,
irregularly irregular. No murmurs , gallops or rubs. Pulmonary ,
bibasilar crackles and wheezes. Abdomen , firm , distended ,
nontender , no rebound or guarding. Lower extremities , edematous.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A1 49-year-old woman with a history of CHF ,
COPD , CAD , status post CABG , status post PE with CHF exacerbation
complicated by acute renal failure , hyperkalemia and UTI.
PLAN:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. Because of the patient&apos;s new
onset of CHF , she was ruled out for MI shortly after admission.
Serial enzymes and EKGs were negative for ischemia. The
patient&apos;s chest pain , however was not consistent with the
patient&apos;s usual cardiac pain. During her stay , the patient was
maintained on an aspirin , beta-blocker and a statin , although the
chest pain was gone on arrival to the ED. Throughout the three
months of the patient&apos;s stay , she did experience similar burning ,
substernal chest pain. EKGs and enzymes sent during these
episodes were always negative for ischemia. It was felt that
this pain was likely secondary to GERD , as it often responded to
Maalox , benzo , lidocaine and/or food.
2. Pump: The patient&apos;s primary symptoms of shortness of breath
likely due to fluid overload. The patient was diuresed with IV
Lasix on the medicine floor. However , on 10/22/06 , the patient
experienced somnolence , low respiratory rate and desaturations in
the setting of opioid administration for pain. The patient
responded partially to Narcan and was transferred to the CCU for
three days for increased monitoring and continuation of diuresis
with a goal of negative 2 liters per day. The patient was
transitioned off methadone and on to oxycodone p.r.n. The
patient was maintained on BiPAP and given albuterol and DuoNeb
inhalers. She passed through this acute decompensation with no
further complications and was transferred back to E on
7/7/06 .  On the floor , the patient was transitioned to p.o.
Lasix. She was diuresed with a goal of 1 to 1.5 liters per day.
IV Lasix were administered p.r.n. shortness of breath/physical
exam consistent with fluid overload. One week prior to transfer ,
the patient was transitioned back to IV Lasix as her daily output
had slowed on p.o. Lasix , she was unable to make TBB goals. On
transfer , the patient shows signs of fluid overload , lower
extremity edema at bedtime BiPAP requirement , but relatively
while pulmonary compensation. The patient&apos;s dry weight is about
200 pounds.
3. Rhythm: The patient has a history of afib. She was rate
controlled with Lopressor and verapamil. She was also
anticoagulated for both her afib and a recent PE with an INR goal
of 2 to 3. Rate control was obtained with the beta-blocker and
calcium channel blocker. During the stay , the patient&apos;s heart
rate is often slightly faster than goal ranging in the 90s to
110s. Further rate control is limited by the patient&apos;s BP with
systolics often in the 90s to 100s. The patient was begun on
verapamil , which was titrated up with her beta-blocker , which was
titrated down. On transfer , the patient was on verapamil 60 mg
p.o. t.i.d. and atenolol 70 mg p.o. daily.
4. Pulmonary: The patient&apos;s pulmonary issues as described
above. The patient also has a history of PE and COPD/asthma.
Post MICU , the patient was maintained on 4 to 5 liters oxygen by
nasal cannula and during the day with BiPAP at nighttime. The
patient&apos;s O2 requirement remained stable until transfer , although
requiring albuterol nebs p.r.n. The patient was kept on Coumadin
for PE with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
5. Renal: The patient&apos;s baseline creatinine was 0.8. On
admission , the patient had ARF felt to be due to CHF/volume
overload leading to poor cardiac output , decreasing perfusion to
the kidneys. As the patient was diuresed , her renal function
improved. This was stable throughout her stay until 10/24/06
when her creatinine began to rise. It was felt that this was due
to a combination over diuresis leading to a prerenal state. No
medication changes have been made near that time except for Lasix
p.o. to IV. In the setting of creatinine bump , Lasix and
spironolactone were discontinued on 10/12/06 .  On 10/25/06 , Lasix
20 IV daily was restarted because of an improving creatinine , but
again held when creatinine returned as 1.5. On transfer , the
patient not on Lasix secondary to creatinine bumps/ARF. We did
not hydrate but monitor creatinine and continue diuresis when
able. Likely prerenal secondary to intravascular depletion
caused by liver cirrhosis leading to poor intravascular
albumin/osmotic pressure. In the setting of discontinuing of
Lasix and poor renal function , the patient did become
hyperkalemic x2 during the week of transfer. The patient did not
initially respond to Kayexalate and lactulose , as she did not
have a bowel movement likely due to opioid use. The patient did
respond to insulins and D50. On 5/30/06 , the patient again had
the elevated potassium to 5.5 , Kayexalate and lactulose x2 ,
produced two bowel movements lowering her K appropriately.
6. ID: During the stay , the patient was treated for UTI with a
three-day course of levofloxacin. Upon discharge , the patient
was asymptomatic.
7. GI: The patient was known to have vascular ectasias in her
stomach. The patient is still guaiac positive during her stay
with no active bleeding. Complicating this is the patient&apos;s need
for anticoagulation secondary to recent PE and afib. This is
felt to be the cause of her slowly dropping hematocrit for which
she required occasional weekly transfusions of packed red blood
cells. The patient on a PPI b.i.d. The patient also has
cirrhosis leading to poor synthetic function , poor intravascular
osmotic pool contributing to fluid overload.
8. Heme: As above , the patient required several transfusions of
TIBCs , although no more than once every one to two weeks. Felt
due to slow GI losses.
9. Endocrine: During the patient&apos;s stay , she was on a basal
Lantus with Aspart coverage. This was titrated up to achieve
good glycemic control. On discharge , the patient was on Lantus
42 units subcu at bedtime and Aspart 10 units a.c./h.s. with an
Aspart sliding scale. This achieved fingerstick glucoses of 120s
to 160s.
10. Psych: The patient has a history of addiction and came to
SMH on methadone. During the patient&apos;s stay , methadone was
tapered and the patient transitioned to oxycodone. The patient
often complained of back pain and burning foot pain felt to be
neuropathy , which was relieved by opioids. The patient often
refusing NSAIDs. On transfer , the patient was on oxycodone 5 to
10 mg p.o. q. 6 h. p.r.n. pain , often taking 10 mg x4 a day. The
patient also complaints of anxiety and insomnia for which 0.5 mg
of Ativan achieved good resolution. At transfer , the patient was
not on standing Ativan just requiring occasional one-time orders
at bedtime. Neurontin was also titrated up during the patient&apos;s
stay. Finally , the patient was started on nortriptyline at
bedtime for pain with good effect.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
1. Fluid balance. The patient is still volume overload with a
baseline weight at 200 pounds , however , the patient
intravascularly dry likely secondary to cirrhosis. Discharge
diuresis was limited by acute renal failure likely prerenal. The
patient has received packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit
and for colloid fluid resuscitation. The patient responds to
Lasix 40 mg IV or 80 mg p.o. Please continue when renal function
improves.
2. Electrolytes. The patient hyperkalemic twice this week
secondary to poor urine output and acute renal failure , responds
to lactulose and K. The patient&apos;s EKG was unchanged.
3. GI bleed. The patient has vascular ectasias in her GI tract ,
however , she is on Coumadin for afib and PE. She is on Nexium 40
mg p.o. b.i.d. and her stools are guaiac positive.
4. Heme. The patient has a slowly dropping crit , might be
secondary to the slow GI bleed. Transfused with a goal
hematocrit greater than 25. Her INR goal is 2 to 3.
5. Physical therapy has worked with the patient and she is able
to get out of bed to the bathroom by herself , though slowly.
6. Pulmonary. The patient is on BiPAP at night , able to secure
facemask on by herself. She is on 4 to 5 liters of nasal cannula
during the daytime , though she often takes , but removes the
oxygen.
7. Psych/Pain: The patient is on oxycodone at minimum , has
received 10 mg x3 a day , now at 4 to 5 per day. The patient is
full code.

Discharge Date: 4/13/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) MITRAL REGURGITATION.
PROCEDURE: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT TIMES FOUR AND MITRAL
VALVE REPAIR ON January , 1999 BY DR. CORNELIUS RISIEN .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year-old woman who
was a patient on the Medicine Service ,
admitted on April , 1999 for cardiac evaluation prior to renal
transplant. She had known end stage renal disease. She was
dialysis dependent since 1995 except for two years between 1997 and
1999 , through which time she had a prior transplant. In addition ,
she has hypertension , diabetes mellitus times 22 years , insulin
dependent , status post cardiac arrest from hypercalcemia in 1999 ,
peripheral vascular disease and claudication and a known
echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 30%. She has a
history of atrial flutter controlled on Amiodarone. At the present
time , a cardiac catheterization performed on April , 1999 showed
left main disease tapering at 40% , LAD disease at 40-45% in the mid
vessel , circumflex disease at 60% proximally and 70-80% in the mid
vessels and right coronary artery proximal to middle disease at
40-60%. An Adenosine MIBI on May , 1999 showed evidence of an
old infarct inferolaterally with severe ischemia elsewhere.
Echocardiogram here at this institution showed an ejection fraction
of 40% with global hypokinesis and severe lateral hypokinesis with
2+ mitral regurgitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , end stage renal disease since
1995 , status post transplant in 1997 with
rejection in 1999 , status post fistula in the right arm , insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus times 21 years with chronic renal
insufficiency and diabetic retinopathy , status post laparoscopic
cholecystectomy , status post dilatation and curettage , coronary
artery disease as above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Cozaar 50 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Prilosec. 3 ) Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.
day. 4 ) Insulin sliding scale. 5 ) Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she is afebrile
with hemodynamics normal on room air. She
is a well appearing , swollen , obese woman in no acute distress.
She had normal dentition. She had no carotid bruits and no jugular
venous distension. Chest is clear bilaterally without rales.
Heart is regular with a two out of six systolic ejection murmur and
no gallops. Abdomen is obese , benign with a left lower quadrant
incision , status post transplant nephrectomy. Peripheral vascular
examination demonstrates palpable radial and axillary pulses , 1+
palpable femoral pulses and a barely palpable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses , both of which were monophasic doppler
signals.
LABORATORY: Preoperative creatinine pre-hemodialysis was 6.7 and
hematocrit was 34.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery
Service from the Medicine Service on January ,
1999 after she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times four
and mitral valve repair. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit for
postoperative care. She underwent dialysis on postoperative day
number one and was extubated after dialysis with a clearing of her
anesthetic medications and paralytic indications. She required
some inotropic support in the immediate postoperative period. She
was gradually weaned from her pressure requirement after
extubation. Coumadin was begun given her history of mitral valve
repair. Nutrition was consulted for lack of appetite. She did
well on her dialysis and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. Echocardiogram was obtained which
was normal. The patient had an otherwise unremarkable
postoperative course which was somewhat slower than average based
on her severe medical problems and need for dialysis. Her chest
tubes were discontinued on postoperative day number three as well
as her epicardial wires without problems. At the time of discharge
dictation , she is ambulating independently , tolerating a renal diet
on no supplemental oxygen.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Dobis in six
weeks. She will follow-up with her cardiologist in one
to two weeks and she will follow-up with the Renal Team in one to
two weeks.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3 )
Coumadin to be dosed based on the recommendations of her Coumadin
Service with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5. 4 ) Celebrex 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. which was added by another physician.

Discharge Date: 10/26/2005
ATTENDING: LAFUENTE , NATHANIAL ROOSEVELT MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Urosepsis.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Diabetes , obesity , severe COPD ,
obstructive sleep apnea , hypercholesterolemia , anemia , colonic
polyps , uterine fibroids , gastrointestinal bled , neutropenic
enteritis , nonsmall cell lung cancer , chronic renal
insufficiency , status post appendectomy , gout , and
osteoarthritis.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: For further details please see
the chart. The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple
medical problems including severe COPD , ( on home O2 2 liters
baseline sat below 90s ) , nonsmall cell lung cancer , diagnosed in
1999 status post multiple chemotherapy regimens , most recently
ALIMTA from 9/27/2005 to 09 , diabetes , obesity , and
chronic renal insufficiency , who was admitted to MICU on
11/26/2005 for neutropenia , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ,
shortness of breath , requiring intubation , hypertension , prerenal
azotemia with a creatinine of 2.9; all of which are believed to
be secondary to sepsis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included Avapro , Lipitor , Decadron ,
ranitidine , Humalog , allopurinol , Alimta , Flonase , vitamin D ,
B12 , and Colace.
ALLERGIES: Bactrim , resulting in acute renal failure and
hyperkalemic , and penicillin resulting in anaphylaxis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Pertinent for the fact that she lives at home.
She has a remote history of smoking , quit 15 years ago , and
denies alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Pertinent for hypertension , stroke , thyroid
cancer , and cervical cancer.
FINDINGS ON ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Shows a temperature
of 98.9. pulse of 116 , and blood pressure 84/47 , and 96% on
ventilation. General exam: She is an obese female , intubated
and awake , motioning to take her tube out. Skin exam showed
scattered group petechial areas over the torso , abdomen , and
under the right breast. HEENT Exam shows pupils equal , round ,
and reactive and anicteric , with a normal JVP. Pulmonary exam
shows decreased mildly decreased breath sounds at the right base.
No crackles , increase in expiratory phase , few scattered rales.
Cardiac exam shows tachycardia otherwise regular rhythm. A 2/6
systolic murmur across precordium. Abdomen is soft , obese ,
positive bowel sounds , nontender , and nondistended with chronic
skin changes below the pannus. Extremities show trace to 1+
edema to the shins , with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic , the patient is awake; however , the exam is otherwise
difficult to perform secondary to the patient being intubated.
PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Show a white count of 0.74 with 46%
polys and 6% bands , resulting in an absolute neutrophil count of
340 , a hematocrit of 26.2 , and platelets of 37. Creatinine of
3.1 , a PTT of 83.5 and INR of 1.4 , and lactic acid of 1.4.
Chest x-ray on admission shows right infrahilar mass , bibasilar
opacities , with chronic alveolar disease versus new fusions , I
cannot rule out infiltrate. Abdominal CT shows small bowel wall
thickening and left-sided atelectasis versus pneumonia.
PROCEDURES: Status post intubation and extubation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Infectious disease: Ms. Dozois was admitted with fever and
hypertension , and I was concerned for sepsis , I initially thought
nosocomial pneumonia versus GI as the primary source. She
required intubation and pressors , and was started on vancomycin ,
Levaquin , and aztreonam along with Flagyl empirically. Her urine
grew Enterococcus and she was changed to Levaquin only on
6/21/2005 to treat an enterococcal UTI and possible nosocomial
pneumonia. An abdominal CT was obtained , which shows small bowel
wall thickening and injection of the SMA territory concerning for
a neutropenic enteritis. Surgery was consulted and she was
managed conservatively with antibiotics initially and then with
bowel rest. She is no longer neutropenic and was off Neupogen
over a week prior to discharge. She was afebrile over the last
week and will stay and finish the 14-day course of Levaquin for
UTI.
2. GI: Ms. Lorts was treated with bowel rest for her neutropenic
enteritis and once she was no longer neutropenic without
abdominal pain , she was started on clear liquid diet. However ,
she developed intermittent GI bleed , secondary to likely
sloughing of her mucosa status post neutropenic enteritis. GI
was consulted and she was again placed on bowel rest. Though ,
she has a history of colonic polyps , GI also felt that the
culprit of her GI bleed is mucosal sloughing as well. She
continued to have intermittent episodes of bloody diarrhea
whenever she was re challenged with p.o. intake. Her C-diff is
negative. Colonoscopy was deferred secondary to
thrombocytopenia. She required multiple red blood transfusions
to maintain her hematocrit greater than 26 , though she was never
hemodynamically unstable. Finally , after given sustained bowel
rest , her blood stools resolved , and she was able to tolerate
oral contrast and an abdominal CT on 9/6/2005 showed no small
bowel wall thickening or any other intraabdominal process causing
her symptoms. Her diet was advanced , and she was tolerating
regular diet at the time of discharge without problems.
3. COPD: On home O2 , typically requiring 2 liters with baseline
sat over 90s. Ms. Shubrick was intubated on admission for increased
shortness of breath and hypoxia. She was extubated the following
day on 8/22/2005 .  She requires BiPAP nightly , now stable on 2
to 4 liters nasal cannula during the day.
4. Heme: On chemotherapy induced anemia with hematocrit drop on
admission to 21 from the baseline of around 26. She responded
well initially to three units of packed red blood cells over
10/18/2005 and 09 .  However , in the setting of her GI
bleed from a sloughing mucosa secondary to resolving neutropenic
enteritis and recent chemo , she required multiple further RBC
transfusions to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. She was
also thrombocytopenic , status post chemo and required multiple
platelet transfusions to keep her platelets greater than 30 , 000.
Hematology was consulted secondary to suboptimal busted platelet
levels status post transfusions , which was felt to be secondary
to poor marrow response in the setting of recent chemo ( workup
was negative for other possible causes refractory
thrombocytopenia , nystatin , allopurinol , were held given possible
worsening of her thrombocytopenia ). On discharge her hematocrit
and platelets were stable respectively at 29.8 and 46 , 000 and she
had not required a transfusion in greater than 24 hours prior to
discharge.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient&apos;s baseline
creatine is 1.7; however , on admission it was noted to be 3 ,
likely secondary to hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea ( FENa
was 0.22% ). Her creatinine is now back to baseline with
hydration. Her creatinine was 1.1 prior to discharge.
6. Nonsmall cell lung cancer: The patient is on Alimta started
for her neutropenia , which has since resolved. She will follow
with her oncologist Dr. Ervin Tonrey for further therapy.
7. Endocrine: Because of her insulin-dependent diabetes , the
patient was placed on portland protocol while on the stress dose.
Steroids were discontinued on 6/21/2005 and she passed a
cortisol stimulation test on 6/21/2005 as well. She was changed
to standing insulin on 6/21/2005 and her Lantus was up titrated
along with sliding scale insulin to maintain blood sugars in the
80s to 120s. She will return home on her home regimen.
8. FEN: TPN was started on 10/4/2005 , given her bowel rest for
possible neutropenic enteritis. She restarted p.o. intake on
10/16/2005 and tolerated advancement to diabetic diet , and she
was weaned off her TPN prior to discharge.
CONSULTANTS: General Surgery , Hematology , and Gastroenterology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Vital signs: T max 98 , blood
pressure 120/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations 20 sating at 95% on
3.5 liters of oxygen. General exam shows an obese female resting
and in no acute distress. Nasal cannula in place. HEENT Exam
was normocephalic , atraumatic. Pulmonary exam showed decreased
air entry , decreased breath sounds , but otherwise no obvious
wheezes or rhonchi. Cardiovascular exam shows regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , but decreased heart sounds.
Abdominal exam shows an obese abdomen , nontender , nondistended ,
positive bowel sounds. Extremities show 1 to 2+ edema
bilaterally to the knee. Skin exam shows a area where left
internal jugular line was removed and the site is intact and
dressed. Improved erythema in her intertriginous areas.
Neurologic exam shows the patient is alert and oriented x3
without any focal neurologic deficits.
The patient was discharged in stable condition and she will
follow up with Dr. Marco Derosset in one week.
The patient is full code.

Discharge Date: 10/4/2006
ATTENDING: DRAPEAU , TRINIDAD MD
DISPOSITION:
To home with VNA service.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post MVP with 30 Cosgrove ring , AVR with a 25 CE and PFO
closure and MAZE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , diabetes mellitus type 1 , gout , paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , prolapse mitral valve with moderate MR.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with past medical history
significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation , severe aortic stenosis and moderate MR. His
symptoms also consisted of dyspnea on exertion. He states that
he gets short of breath walking on an incline after one to two
blocks. He has no angina , orthopnea , no neurologic symptoms.
Stress echo on 8/10/06 showed no evidence of ischemia but
importantly a fall in BP with exercise and was not able to go
beyond 2.5 minutes due to fatigue. Echo also demonstrated an
aortic stenosis with a neck area of 0.9 cm2 with a peak gradient
35 , mean of 21 , and a junctional moderate MR from myxomatous
prolapse. Cardiac cath at GMH on 3/4/06 showed single-vessel
CAD involving LAD. The patient was initially scheduled to
undergo AVR , plus MVP and MAZE on 1/26/06 .  Preop chest x-ray
revealed pulmonary fibrosis and mild pulmonary edema , which was
also confirmed with CT of chest without contrast. PFTs were
suggestive of restrictive lung disease. Pulmonary service was
consulted and it is considered that the patient&apos;s fibrosis has
not progressed and that new chest x-ray changes may be likely due
to his interstitial pulmonary edema. It was suggested that the
risk of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery would be
moderate. Carotid ultrasound showed 65-70% RCA occlusion , which
is asymptomatic. The patient is rescheduled for AVR , plus MVP
and plus MAZE on 5/5/06 .
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS:

Bypass time: 219 minutes. Crossclamp time 156 minutes. There
were no complications. The patient was transferred to the unit
in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. In the ICU ,
starting postop day #1 , the patient was extubated , postop day #2
remains AV paced. Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #2.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Pain control , Toradol.
Cardiovascular: On Coumadin , captopril issues was being AV paced
through a.m. with transfer and now in first-degree AV block ,
holding Lopressor.
Respiratory: No issues , have been extubated postoperative day
#1.
GI: Passed speech and swallow. Diet was advanced as tolerated ,
Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
Renal: Started Lasix 20 b.i.d.
Endocrine: Diabetes insulin treatment with subq insulin.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with Coumadin , recent MAZE
procedure/atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues.
Transferred to the Stepdown Unit where he
proceeded to progress well. Postop day #2 , chest tubes removed
wires left in. Postop day #3 , slow junctional rhythm with rates
in the 40s being externally V paced , rate of 88 and wires not
working. EP states if further rhythm is not recover by postop
day #4 to #5 to reconsult. Foley reinserted for retention of 400
mL output. Started Flomax. On low-dose Coumadin for MVP/MAZE in
case pacemaker was needed. We will need rehabilitation upon
discharge. Post-day #4 remains to be V paced with junctional
rhythm. The wires are in and do not conduct or capture. EP
feels the patient may require pacemaker , we will observe for now.
Upper extremity noninvasive studies for left greater than right
arm swelling , negative for DVT. Holding Coumadin pending
possible pacemaker placement. Past video swallow today for
regular diet.
Postop echo pending for MVP. Rehabilitation when medically
ready. Postop day #5 , postop showed slow junctional rhythm with
EP following for possible pacemaker , and they set a pacemaker at
heart rate of 40. The patient in junctional rhythm/afib , heart
rate in the 60s , A wire and do not conduct or capture. V wire
set at a backup rate of 40. EP just came by and feels patient is
likely recovered conduction. Possibly an atrial fibrillation
versus accelerated junctional with heart rates in the 80s and
thinks pacemaker will not be indicated. Plan to discontinue
wires in a.m. if the patient&apos;s rhythm remain stable.
Postop echo done for MVP. EF 55% , No comment on MR. Foley
discontinued last night after insertion voiding well today on
Flomax. Low-dose Lovenox anticipate eventual discharge to
rehabilitation on Lovenox/Coumadin and bridge after pacemaker.
White count up slightly to 11.1 low-grade temps. UA negative.
Rehabilitation when medically ready given possibility of
pacemaker requirement. Postop day #6 , spoke with EPS as the
patient is in stable sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block ,
okay to remove wires implanted for pacemaker , ambulating well for
room air. We plan to send to rehab when bed available. Postop
day #7 , the patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to
be stable to discharge to home with VNA service with the
following discharge instructions.
DIET: Low-cholesterol , low saturated fat. ADA 2100 calories per
day.

ATTENDING: ENDERBY , HORACIO RILEY MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was diagnosed with coarctation of the
aorta in the early 1960s when he was told that he had a heart
murmur. At that time , he received no treatment and since the 1980&apos;s , has been
treated for hypertension , with blood pressures
unresponsive to medication. In 1/16 , the patient underwent
stenting of that coarctation and since then he has been followed
by serial echos. In the recent echo , he was noted to also have
progression of his aortic valve stenosis. The patient now
presents with marked limitation of his activities with some
complaint of the anginal type symptoms that wakes him one to two
times a week. The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on
10/15/06 , which showed a 70% mid circumflex and 70% proximal OM2 ,
and a 40% proximal LAD and patient is now referred for aortic
valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient&apos;s past cardiovascular intervention , as stated above ,
stenting of the coarctation on 1/16 and status post two
cardiac catheterizations.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient&apos;s past medical history is significant for the
coarctation , aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease. The patient also has
history of hypertension , history of diabetes on both oral and
insulin therapy. The patient also has history of
hypercholesterolemia , glaucoma bilaterally with right cataract
that was repaired.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Inguinal hernia repair in 1994 , cataract surgery in 2004 ,
circumcision in 1995 and status post stenting of this coarctation
in 2002.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Mother with diabetes and father with Parkinson&apos;s disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
A cigar smoker , a retired history teacher.
ALLERGIES:
Beta-blocker , &quot;drops&quot; his heart rate too low and penicillin causes
a rash.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
5 feet 9 inches , 112 kilograms. Vital signs: Temperature of 97 ,
heart rate of 74 , blood pressure in the right arm of 110/60 and
left arm 130/60 , on room air 96%. HEENT: PERRLA , dentition
without evidence of infection. No carotid bruit. Chest: No
incision. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with grade
III murmur. Pulses: 2+ pulses throughout. Allen&apos;s test of the
left upper extremity normal by pulse oxymetry. Respiratory:
Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Abdomen: No incision , soft , no
mass noted. Rectal: Deferred. Extremities: Without scarring ,
varicosity , or edema. Neuro: Alert and oriented with no focal
deficits.
LABORATORY DATA:
On admission , chemistries from 4/23/06: sodium of 143 , potassium
of 4 , chloride of 104 , CO2 of 29 , BUN of 9 , creatinine of 0.8 ,
glucose of 82 , and a magnesium of 1.8. Hematology from the same
day: white count of 12.7 , hematocrit of 43.3 , hemoglobin of 14.2 , platelets at
275 , 000 , PT of 13.2 , INR 1 , and a PTT of 29.9.
Cardiac catheterization done on 10/15/06 , coronary artery stenosis with a
70% mid circumflex , 70% proximal OM2 , and a 40% proximal LAD.
EKG on 10/15/06 normal sinus rhythm at 74. Chest x-ray reported
as normal from 8/4/06 .
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 2/4/06 and was taken to operating
room and underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 St. Jude
Regent valve and an aortic root patch and a CABG x1 with the
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1. The patient&apos;s
total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 156 minutes , cross clamp
time was 220 minutes. The patient came off the heart lung
machine without any difficulty on no pressors and was taken up to
the Intensive Care Unit and extubated 14 hours postoperatively.
The patient&apos;s postoperative course by systems:
Neurologically:remained intact.
Cardiovascular: The patient initially was not on any pressors but for
pressure , required pacing and was started
on some dopamine as well as vasopressin , which was on until
postoperative day #3. By postoperative day #4 , patient was started on low-dose
beta-blockers , however , had some bradycardia and no further
beta-blockers were given throughout his postoperative stay. The
patient remained in normal sinus rhythm in the rates of 70s-80s on no
medication.
Respiratory: The patient was extubated 14 hours postoperatively
and was on Lasix for diuresis. He will be sent home on five more
days of Lasix at 20 mg p.o. daily. His discharge chest x-ray
shows minimal edema. No pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
GI: The patient was tolerating p.o. without any difficulty and
was on Nexium for GI prophylaxis. However , he had no prior history
of GERD or ulcer and will not be on any medications on discharge.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
his postoperative course and will be discharged with just 5
more days of Lasix 20 qd , with potassium replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was on oral and insulin ,
preoperatively and required an insulin drip intraoperatively and
closely followed by our Diabetes Service. The patient is
requiring a little bit more Lantus then he took preoperatively , as well as
some insulin with meals. The patient should follow his
fingersticks as he was preoperatively and follow up with his PCP
for his diabetric management.
Heme: The patient is on Coumadin for his
mechanical aortic valve. However , his INR on day of discharge was still
not therapeutic with an INR of 1.4. The decision was made for the patient to be
able to be discharged to home with a Lovenox bridge. He will be sent
home with 120 mg of Lovenox until his INR is greater than 2. A
phone call was placed through the Naplesgea Hospital .  They will follow
closely due to the lovenox bridge then will also follow his coumadin dosing.
The patient is also on baby aspirin for his coronary artery
disease. The patient had a stable hematocrit with a discharge
hematocrit of 26 and INR stated above of 1.4.
The patient is otherwise in stable condition. A decision was made that the
patient to be discharged to home on postoperative day #8.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
He will be discharged on these following medications:

SOCIAL HISTORY: Cigarettes one-half pack per day x31 years.
Alcohol none. The patient is on disability.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s mother passed away with diabetes
mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , pulse 96 ,
blood pressure 120/70 , and
respirations 18. GENERAL: In no apparent distress. HEENT:
Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements
were intact. Cranial nerves II-XII normal with bilateral carotid
bruits , right more than left. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2. No
murmurs appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and
non-distended. Bowel sounds positive. EXTREMITIES: Without edema
and warm.
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a sodium of 137 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 104 , bicarbonate 15 , BUN 86 , creatinine
3.1. Creatinine on June , 1999 was 2.7 and creatinine on
May , 1999 was 3.0. ALT was 6 , AST 11 , alkaline phosphatase
44 , bilirubin total 0.4 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , calcium 9.5 ,
cholesterol 360 , and HDL 40. White blood cell count was 7.08 ,
hematocrit 25.9; on June , 1999 , the patient&apos;s hematocrit was
31.9 , and platelets 279. Echocardiogram from September of 1999 had
moderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy , ejection fraction
of 55% , borderline hypokinetic inferior left ventricular wall , mild
mitral regurgitation , and left atrial dilatation. Carotid
noninvasives from October of 1999 showed no significant right or
left internal carotid stenosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old woman with a history of
end stage renal disease , status post renal
transplant in February of 1997 , history of insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery
bypass grafting in 1996 ( left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal ) ,
now with episodes of rapid heart rate and episodes of skipped beats
in association without shortness of breath. Also , the patient has
had a hematocrit drop from 31 to 26 on admission and a history of
blood in stool over the last month. The patient was guaiaced on
admission and during her stay and remained guaiac negative
throughout the whole time. The patient was placed on cardiac
monitoring and had no events recorded on the monitor. On September , 2000 , the patient&apos;s hematocrit dropped to 21. She was
transfused two units of blood and her hematocrit went up to 31. An
exercise tolerance test MIBI was performed which was negative for
ischemia. The patient&apos;s ejection fraction from the MIBI was
approximated to be 69%. On August , 2000 , carotid
non-invasives were repeated which revealed moderate internal
carotid plaque on the right. Otherwise , she had mild stenosis of
the other arteries. An echocardiogram was also performed which
revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection
fraction of 65%. The patient was taken to Electrophysiology Study
on October , 2000 which revealed nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia with possible right ventricular outflow tract origin.
It was hoped that she could be maintained on Lopressor and
Verapamil. Due to the results of this study , the patient was
already on Atenolol for Beta blockade and Verapamil was tried.
However , her blood pressure did not tolerate this medication. The
day after the electrophysiology procedure on March , 2000 , the
patient was orthostatic. She was given a 250 cc fluid bolus and
encouraged to drink more p.o. fluids and she was discharged in
stable condition the next day. The patient remained symptom free
during the entire hospital course. The patient&apos;s triglycerides
were checked during the hospitalization and found to be very high
in the 1 , 500 range. The patient was therefore taken off
Simvastatin and started on Gemfibrozil.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2. Vitamin
C 100 mg p.o. q. day x14 days. 3. Epogen

Discharge Date: 1/25/2003
ATTENDING: DORIAN GENEREUX MD , PHD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Muschaweck is an 80-year-old woman
with known history of congestive heart failure and flash
pulmonary edema who presents with gradually increasing shortness
of breath for 2 weeks. Patient denies any chest pain , nausea ,
vomiting , palpitations or syncope. She does acknowledge sitting
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately 48
hours before admission , no lower extremity edema. She denies any
changes in diet or changes in medical adherence. She states her
weight has been about constant at 180 pounds on her home scale.
She does note that she has poor exercise tolerance at baseline
but even now unable to perform activities of daily living for 48
hours , so she came to the Istbern Sentne Emergency Department with her
daughter. She was found to be hypertensive , hypoxic with
clinical and chest radiographic evidence of congestive heart
failure. She was treated with oxygen , IV Lasix and nitro-paced
in the ER and admitted for further treatment of her CHF
exacerbation. Her physical exam revealed a heart rate of 52
beats per minute , respiratory rate of 20 , blood pressure of
176/74 , and she was satting 97% on 4 L of oxygen. The patient
was in no acute distress , she is pleasant , a little overweight ,
alert and oriented times person , place and time. Her jugular
venous pressure was approximately 12 cm of water. She did have
pulses parvus et tardus , no Kussmaul sign. She had rales
one-half way up the pulmonary fields bilaterally. Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm , bradycardic. There was a 3/6 systolic
murmur with a slurred S2. Her abdomen was benign. She had no
lower extremity edema. She had cool extremities and neurologic
exam , other than patient being alert and oriented , was nonfocal
with no motor deficits.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Revealed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 105 , bicarb 26 , BUN 31 , a creatinine 1.9 , a glucose of
152. A white count within normal limits , a hematocrit of 41.8 , a
platelet count of 289 , calcium 8.8. Her coags revealed a PTT of
32.7 , an INR of 3.2 , her creatine kinase was 41 , her MB fraction
was 1.9 , her troponin was negative. Her BNP , brain natriuretic
peptide , was 885. Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at
48 beats/minute. No significant ST or T-wave abnormalities. No
significant from change from 1/8 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Patient has known aortic stenosis with an
AVA of 1.0. She has coronary artery disease status post acute MI
in 2001 , status post two-vessel CABG , she had the left internal
mammary to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM-2. She
has atrial fibrillation , for that she is on amiodarone and
Coumadin. She has diabetes mellitus. She has
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease ,
bladder cancer status post resection.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg each day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg each day.
3. Lasix 120 mg by mouth twice a day.
4. Zestril 40 mg po each day.
5. Zocor 40 mg p.o. every night before bedtime.
6. Niferex 150 mg twice a day.
7. Insulin NPH 48 units in the morning and 4 units in the
evening.
8. Levoxyl 25 mcg each day.
9. Coumadin 2.5 mg on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , and 3 mg on
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , Sunday.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She denied all vises , such as tobacco , alcohol or
drugs. She lives with her daughter , Severi .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As in HPI , no fever , chills , rash , medications
changes or urinary symptoms.
ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION: She was an 80-year-old woman with known
coronary artery disease here with a chief complaint of worsening
shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure
exacerbation most likely left-sided diastolic dysfunction. There
was no clear etiology , however , dietary or medication issues were
not likely given the patient&apos;s excellent awareness and
involvement in her care. The suspicion was that the patient may
have had increasing blood hypertension out of control , increasing
oxygen demand and creating diastolic function and pulmonary
edema. The role of her aortic valve was unclear , however , there
may have been gradual progression and renal artery stenosis
cannot be rule out as an etiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her cardiovascular system , she
was diuresed with IV Lasix and her electrolytes were followed
closely. She came in with a weight of 84.7 kg and left with a
weight of 83.7 kg. For two days in the middle she was diuresed
with IV Lasix
120 mg b.i.d. and she was converted to oral Lasix and actually
continued her diuresis , in fact after pacemaker placement , which
will be noted below , she may have actually continued to urinate
even more so on the last day of her admission. Her blood
pressure was stable throughout her stay , in the low 100s ,
consistently below 150 systolic and above 100 systolic.
Rhythm: In terms of her rhythm , she was found at several points
throughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardia
consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial
fibrillation treated with amiodarone; it was thought she would
benefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker. So , a
pacemaker was placed on 6/21/2003 without complications. The
pacemaker was a dual-chamber PPM. Her INR before it was placed
was 1.7 , and there was some oozing from the site , however , her
hematocrit was stable and her hemodynamics were stable for 24
hours after the procedure. Electrophysiologists analyzed the
device and found that it was working properly. She is scheduled
for follow up with Dr. Gutirrez on 4/13/2003 at 9:40 in the
morning. She has been advised to limit her driving until that
appointment. She has also been advised that she will not be able
to have an MRI in the future. She will be discharged on Keflex
( cephalexin ) 250 mg p.o. 4 times a day for 3 days on discharge
for her pacemaker and if she has any problems at all with her
pacemaker she should call Dr. Richel at
telephone # ( 851 ) 491-7503 , adetc # 33243.
2. Pulmonary: The patient had PFTs done in 9/18 which showed
an FVC of 73% of predicted , FEV1 of 77% of predicted , and FEV1 to
FVC ratio of 108% , and FEF 25/75 of 80% , a TLC of 50% of
predicted , an SVC of 73% of predicted , a residual volume of 40%
of predicted , and an RV/TLC of 72% of predicted. Her DLCO
uncorrected was 44%; her DLCO corrected was 44%. During her
stay , patient had low O2 saturations at rest ranging from the
high 80s to the low 90s , but often below 88% and on exertion
consistently in the mid-80% range , not depending on where the
probe was placed. She was unable to be weaned from the oxygen
and will be sent home on oxygen. She should be followed up with
a CT of the chest. A CT of the chest was done on this admission ,
however , it was consistent with CHF and other things could not be
ruled out. Of note , on the chest CT there were found to be liver
lesions which will be commented on below. The patient should
also be worked up for her pulmonary issues.
3. Radiology: The patient had this chest CT which showed
multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs , diffuse
haziness , some septal thickening with slight basil predominance ,
multiple borderline mediastinal nodes in the anterior
mediastinum , an AP window region with the largest node on image
21 measuring 1.3 x 2 cm , there were extensive vascular
calcifications , cardiomegaly with multi-chamber enlargement and
particularly dense coronary calcifications , trace right and left
pleural effusions. Visualized organs of the upper abdomen
demonstrate multiple ill-defined low attenuation foci in the
liver but no other abnormality. Review of bone window shows
extensive thoracic degenerative change , sternal wires and
epicardial pacer leads. The lung findings were consistent with
cardiomegaly and CHF , but could not rule out other diagnostic
possibilities including atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity ,
pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor. In order
to workup the liver mass , an ultrasound of the abdomen was
attained. The liver showed a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it was
hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the
liver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the CT of
7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder was normal with no stones ,
the biliary tree was normal , as were the right kidney and left
kidney , pancreas , although it was poorly visualized. The spleen
was normal , the aorta was normal , pleural effusion was noted on
the left which was small and prominent hepatic veins were noted.
The radiologist&apos;s impression was that the ectogenic mass on the
right lower lobe of the kidney corresponded in the location of
the mass reported on prior CTs , may be a hemangioma or other
ectogenic masses which could not be excluded and he noted that
the patient could not hold her breath sufficiently well to
evaluate the mass with Doppler. If indicated , the PMD should
either get a nuclear scan , CT , the radiologist suggested MRI but
that is now impossible given the pacemaker , for confirmation and
further evaluation. Also , it was noted that she had prominent
hepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure.
OTHER ISSUES:
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on her Levoxyl 25 and
her home dose of insulin with good blood sugar controls generally
below fingerstick of 200.
5. Heme: The patient was continued on her Niferex. Her
hematocrit was stable throughout her stay with her admission
hematocrit being 41.8 and discharge hematocrit being 38.8. Her
white count also was not elevated. She is discharged with a
white count of 6.8. Her INR on admission was 3.2 , her Coumadin
was held and 1 mg of vitamin K was given before her procedure.
Her INR on the day of the procedure , 6/21/2003 , was 1.7 and on
discharge it was 1.3. She will be reinstituted on her same
Coumadin level , to follow up with Dr. Garder and to have her
Coumadin level checked on 5/25/2003 and be followed as she was.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: As admission medicines except #1 , she will
be taking cephalexin for 3 days and that is the only difference.
Her primary care doctor can consider can titrating her CHF
medicines and/or her hypertension medicines.

Discharge Date: 1/6/2001
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: Hypertension , non insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , and
coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old Spanish
speaking male with multiple cardiac
risk factors and extensive cardiac history including a
long-standing history of hypertension , non insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus since 1995 with hemoglobin AIC of 10.5 on
11/16/01 , 20 pack year smoking history and family history
significant for MI in his brothers at age 46 and 50 and history of
hyperlipidemia. The patient had his first MI in 1990 complicated
by congestive heart failure. An echocardiogram at an outside
hospital revealed EF of 22% with a dyskinetic apex and a dilated
left atrium. In August of 1995 , he had another MI , was
hospitalized at Sterrice where he required
intubation secondary to pulmonary edema. In April of 1995 , he
was admitted again for congestive heart failure and an
echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25 to 30% , anterior and
anterolateral hypokinesis , moderate inferior and mild septal
hypokinesis and mild MR. Cath. in 1995 showed three vessel disease
and the patient underwent four vessel CABG in October of 1996 with
saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM1 and OM3 and a LIMA to the LAD.
During the surgery , the patient had an ICG placed prophylactically
as part of the CABG patch study. Since the surgery , he has had
additional episodes of congestive heart failure with report of a
hospitalization in September 2000 in Ox News The patient
reports he was hospitalized at that time for difficulty breathing
and a third MI. He required intubation during this hospitalization
and the course apparently was complicated by renal failure. Since
September 2000 , the patient has reportedly felt well with no difficulty
breathing or chest pain. More recently , two months prior to
admission , the patient was found to have atrial flutter. He was
started on 80 mg of sotalol and his arrhythmia spontaneously
converted. Today , the patient presented to his
electrophysiologist , Dr. Handelsman for routine interrogation of his
pacemaker and was found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular rate in the 120s. Additionally , the patient reports
worsening lower extremity edema bilaterally for the past six days
and decreased urine output. The patient denies chest pain ,
shortness of breath. He has had no palpitations , diaphoresis ,
nausea , vomiting. He denies dietary indiscretion or any medication
changes. He has had no fever , dysuria or cough. He has stable two
pillow orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion but no paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. His most recent echocardiogram was in September of
2000 which showed a dilated left ventricle with EF of 15 to 20% and
global hypokinesis. The right ventricle was moderately enlarged
with depressed function. He had a thickened aortic valve and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. He had mild MR with an
enlarged left atrium at 5.7 cm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated , hypertension , diabetes ,
hyperlipidemia , coronary disease and
congestive heart failure.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 10
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day ,
Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 80 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. h.s. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.
day , and Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day.
Of note , upon further questioning , it turns out the patient had
been taking amiodarone and had only been started on sotalol briefly
but became hypotensive with that and so he was switched to
amiodarone.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 20 pack year history of smoking and
currently continues with binge drinking of greater
than four whiskey drinks at a time. He lives in News Ale with
his wife and children and he has not had work since his CABG.

CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic , irregularly irregular with normal S1 ,
S2 and 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. ABDOMEN:
Soft , moderately distended , non-tender. Incisional scars noted
ventrally and centrally. There is no shifting dullness.
EXTREMITIES: 2 to 3+ pitting edema to mid thigh with notable
scrotal edema. 2+ femoral pulses appreciated on the right. Pedal
pulses not appreciated though. Tibial pulses not appreciated.
Lower extremities were warm to touch. NEURO: Grossly nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 98 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 34 , creatinine 1.8 and
glucose of 146 , calcium of 10.2. White blood cell count is 6.5 ,

EKG shows an irregular rhythm , atrial fibrillation at a rate of
approximately 100 to 110 , no LDH , no RVH , and no acute ST , T wave.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small pleural effusion , and
pulmonary vascular distribution and mild interstitial edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to cardiology service
for rate control and diuresis. He remained in
atrial fibrillation throughout the hospital course with rates
between 60 and 100. His Digoxin was continued and a low dose of
Lopressor 6.25 b.i.d. was started for rate control. The patient
ruled out for MI with CKs of 18 and 124 and Troponin of 0.06. He
was diuresed with IV Lasix that was titrated up to a dose of 200 mg
IV b.i.d. proceeded by 500 mg of Diuril b.i.d. Over the course of
the hospitalization , the patient&apos;s fluid status was negative 7.5
liters with marked improvement in his lower extremities edema. His
weight at discharge was 88 kg which is baseline per the patient.
He was restarted on his amiodarone 200 mg daily and an
echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated 4+ MR and TR , and an
EF of 15 to 20%. This was similar to an echocardiogram from
September of 2000. The patient will follow-up with Dr. Marc R Bessick on July and Dr. Eloy Williamston on November for
consideration of electrical cardioversion. He will also continue
on oral Lasix , Zaroxolyn and Coumadin as well as his previously

LABORATORY DATA: Preoperative laboratory studies on 6/8/03:
Sodium 142 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 106 , carbon
dioxide 29 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 152. Magnesium 2.0.
White blood cells 4.6 , hematocrit 33.1 , platelets 181 , PT 13.9 , PTT
34.0 , INR 1.1.
An ECG on 4/7/03 showed normal sinus rhythm at 64 beats per minute
with inverted T&apos;s in leads II , III , and AVF. Chest x-ray on
11/8/03 is normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent the following procedures
while a patient here at Dalu Health 1. EGD 12/10/03 , by Dr. Fjeld . 2. Coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with saphenous vein graft to PDA ,
saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal artery , and LIMA to
LAD , by Dr. Gerould . 3. Colonoscopy 11/10/03 .  4. Right colectomy ,
sigmoid colectomy , open cholecystectomy , transverse mucous fistula ,
and sigmoid mucous fistula on 3/20/03 that was by Dr. Stenman .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Neurological: The patient has had no
neurological events during his
hospitalization. He continues on Paxil 40 mg p.o. q. day for
depression , and he has no pain.
Cardiovascular: The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman who
presents with recurrent unstable angina. His prior episode had
been in 1977 at which time he was found to have modest triple
vessel coronary disease. He had been medically managed
successfully , but presented with recurrent unstable angina. An
ejection fraction was 42% with inferior hypokinesis to akinesis.
Preoperatively , he was found to have severe triple vessel coronary
artery disease. The patient was taken for coronary artery bypass
grafting times three as described above on 10/6/03 .  This was
performed by Dr. Tatom without complications. The patient
improved well postoperatively. He was at the point of being ready
for discharge to rehabilitation when a bed was available. Because
he had been found to be guaiac positive preoperatively , it was
decided to perform a colonoscopy before his discharge. The rest of
his GI history will be discussed below in the GI section.
The other significant event regarding the patient&apos;s cardiac system
occurred on his way to the Operating Room on 3/20/03 , with an acute
abdomen. While transferring the patient to the Operating Room
table , he had a cardiac arrest lasting one and a half minutes. He
was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Following the operation a an
EKG was needed emergently. The patient ruled out for an MI. He
did have postoperative atrial fibrillation. He is currently in
normal sinus rhythm , but slips in and out of atrial fibrillation.
His rate is well controlled on Lopressor 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q. day. He has been anticoagulated with
Coumadin , and he is currently therapeutic with his most recent INR
on 10/14/03 of 2.6. His most recent Coumadin doses have been five mg
on 9/26/30 , three mg on 10/10 , zero mg on 9/19/2 ,
and four mg on 10/27 .  The patient&apos;s primary cardiologist is Dr.
Brant , and the patient will follow-up with Dr. Vandebrink .
His most recent INR is 2.4 on 6/17/03 , and his Coumadin will be
dosed at rehabilitation today.
Respiratory: The patient was intubated for his procedures. He was
extubated without difficulty. He currently has no respiratory
issues. His oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. His most recent
chest x-ray was a portable chest x-ray on 5/25/03 , which showed
subsegmental atelectasis and a minimal right pleural effusion , but
no evidence of congestive heart failure or other disease processes.
Gastrointestinal: A preoperative work-up before his coronary
artery bypass graft surgery showed that the patient was guaiac
positive and EGD on 12/10/03 by Dr. Zadorozny showed no lesions as a
likely cause of his GI bleeding , but did reveal some gastritis. It
was decided that it would be safe to proceed with surgery , and have
the patient follow-up with a colonoscopy after his procedure.
Discharge was planned , and before discharge a colonoscopy was
performed on 11/10/03 by Dr. Bealer . A single large pedunculated
smooth polyp at 25 centimeters from the anus was found. After this
procedure the patient did well initially , but then did develop
abdominal distention. At first it was thought that his symptoms
were due to Ogilivie&apos;s syndrome or pseudo-obstruction , however ,
because of his distention it was not felt safe to perform a barium
enema. A KUB showed air throughout the colon and small bowel. He
had absolutely no pain or tenderness. The General Surgery Service
was consulted and an NG tube was placed , and he was given enemas
p.r. He did well with no complaints of pain or tenderness ,
however , a KUB on 9/8/03 showed that his cecum was distended 12
centimeters and the white count was over 20. CT scan showed a
cecum to be 14 centimeters and there was a suggestion of narrowing
of the sigmoid colon. It was decided to take him to the Operating
Room. A routine chest x-ray showed free air in the diaphragm which
was concerning and surgery was undertaken. Please see the
operative note of Dr. Jou for details regarding this procedure.
A right colectomy , sigmoid colectomy , cholecystectomy ,
transverse mucous fistula , and sigmoid mucous fistula were
performed. The patient improved well postoperatively. We were
able to advance his diet and discontinue his two JP drains. At
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet. His wound is
healing well and his staples have been removed. Intraoperatively
the patient was found to have obstruction of the sigmoid colon and
a pathological specimen revealed adenocarcinoma moderately
differentiated , four centimeters in maximum dimension. The tumor
invaded through the rest of the pericolonic fat. Margins were
clear and ten lymph nodes were negative for disease. The stage of
the tumor is T4BN0MX. The patient will follow-up with Dr. Walken
regarding further management of this cancer.
GU: Two attempts have been made to discontinue the patient&apos;s Foley
catheter most recently on 10/14/03 .  He had a high postvoid residual ,
the Foley catheter was left in. The patient is on Flomax. He will
be discharged with a Foley in place and discontinuation of the
Foley should be tried again in seven days. His most recent set of
electrolytes on 6/17/03 include a potassium of 4.3 , magnesium 1.8.
He is making good urine output.
Hematology: The patient has had no hematologic issues during his
hospitalization. His anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation is
covered above. His most recent laboratory values on 6/17/03 , are
white blood cells 6.8 , hematocrit 30.4 , platelets 247 , PT 25.7 , PTT
49.8 , INR of 2.4.
Infectious disease: The patient was treated with perioperative
ampicillin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. He is currently on no
antibiotics and has no infectious disease issues. His white count
is 6.8 and he is afebrile.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
FOLLOW-UP: Dr. Pruna call for appointment in one to two weeks.
Dr. Alfaro call for an appointment in one to two
weeks. Dr. Laubscher call clinic for appointment in four weeks. Dr.
Fanti call for appointment after discharge from rehabilitation.

A/P: 77F w ho CAD p/w chest pain of sudden onset: Original ddx includes
acs/usa/PE/hypertensive urgency or emergency/msk/chf. Given the excellenet
response to heparin and a negative cardiac catheterization , and the
continuoation of pain despite control of hypertension , the cardiac team
felt that the most likely diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism. However , had
neg lenis and PE CT , so unlikely PE. She was discharged home with follow up
with Dr. Sollitto and with her usual PCP. Will need monitoring of lytes and
Cr given possibility of contrast induced nephropathy in setting of
underlying elev Cr.
**CV: ( i ): Chest pain was initially concerning for ischemic pain;
however , cardiac catheterization was unchanged from prior cath. She
will continue asa/plavix/BB/statin; she ruled out for MI w serial
enzymes and ekgs. Given an intermediate to high probability story
and an intermediate V-Q scan , she was continued on heparin and PE protocol
CT of chest was obtained , which was neg for PE but showed a pulmonary
nodule; she will need repeat CT for nodule f/u in 6-12 months. Excellent
oxygentation , stable walking and nearly pain free at time of discharge.
( r ): no active issues , telemetry monitoring was nl.
( p ): HTN , w ss , uptitrated labetalol for BP.
**PULM: PE intermediate pretest prob - elev d dimer but no ekg changes , no
o2 req , no known ca , no obvious dvt risks. lenis negative , PE CT neg , so PE
considered unlikely , will not anticoagulate. Pulm nodule on CT , will need
6-12 month f/u scan. Of importance however , has
pulm hypertension that is new on R heart cath and given no other
explanation for sudden pressure changes ( impressively higher since last
cath ) , may have primary pulm HTN. Given ground glass in lungs and pulm
nodule , should have outpt pulm eval for pulm parenchymal disease in near
future.

presents to us with right leg swelling , pain and tenderness times
2-3 days. The patient was last discharged from A De Medical Center for congestive heart failure exacerbation and chronic
abdominal distention on November , 2000. She was in her usual state
of poor health until three days prior to admission when she noted
an increase in lower extremity edema bilaterally. Two days prior
to admission she noted fever , increased abdominal distention and
abdominal pain. She noted rash in the right lower extremity the
day prior to presentation which had rapidly progressed over one
day , extending from heel to knee. She had not been walking for
four days due to swelling in bilateral legs. She denies chest pain ,

ALLERGIES: Include Aldomet , nifedipine , darvocet which makes her
drowsy , Percocet which makes her vomit.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her sister in Morp Dr The son is
involved in her care. She does not have a history
of smoking or drinking. Her husband died a year ago of
complications from cardiac bypass.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 102.1 , blood
pressure 148/68 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 ,
sating 92% on two liters. General examination: This is an obese
woman lying at a 30 degree angle on the bed , pleasant and not in
acute distress. Head and neck examination was benign. Lungs have
rales up one-third of the lungs bilaterally , no wheezes or rhonchi.
Heart regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 with S3 and II/VI systolic
murmur , best heard over the base. Jugular venous pulsation at 11
cm. Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , mildly distended ,
no mass and normal bowel sounds. Extremities showed diffuse
erythema from right heel extending to 5 cm below the knee , mild
tenderness , edema greater in the right leg than the left leg. 3+
pitting edema bilaterally. She also has a 5 cm x 5 cm skin graft
over the right heel with some skin breakdown around the graft site ,
slightly weepy , no pus. Neurologic examination: The patient is
alert and oriented times three. Cranial nerves are intact. The
patient does not have any sensation in bilateral legs. Normal
strength.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for hematocrit of 30.7 , white blood
count 10 , 340 , with a differential of 76 polys , 14
bands , 5 lymphocytes. Chem-7 was significant for creatinine of
1.8. Her liver function tests were within normal range. Her CK
first set was 120 with an MB of 2.6 and troponin of 1.39 , coags
normal D-dimer of greater than 1 , 010. Her urinalysis was negative.
Electrocardiogram showed 1 mm ST depression in the lateral leads ,
unchanged from baseline. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral
interstitial prominence , could be consistent with pulmonary edema ,
no focal opacities.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
PROBLEM #1 , CELLULITIS: On admission , the patient was started on
cefazolin and Flagyl for broad coverage of cellulitis given she has
a history of diabetes mellitus. In addition , levofloxacin was
also started on hospital day #2 to cover gram negative organisms.
Blood cultures on admission are negative. Because of the skin
graft on the patient&apos;s right heel , plastic surgery was consulted to
assess the integrity of the skin graft. They concluded that the
skin graft is intact and the source of the cellulitis was not in
the heel. On hospital day #3 , Flagyl was discontinued because the
patient could not tolerate oral sores and the GI upset. Therefore ,
we elected to change the antibiotic regimen to Clindamycin and
levofloxacin. cefazolin and Flagyl were discontinued. On hospital
day #6 the patient developed diarrhea. Given her history of C.
difficile in the past and the lack of improvement in her
cellulitis , Infectious Disease were consulted. We started
cefotaxime and Vancomycin on hospital day #7. The patient
continued to have low grade temperature spikes with daily blood
cultures which have all been negative. Wound culture of the bullae
on the right lower extremity was also taken which has also been
negative. Vancomycin was discontinued due to low suspicions of
resistant organisms. The patient also had LENIs which were
negative for DVT as well as a right foot film which showed no signs
of osteomyelitis. Unfortunately , the cellulitis does not look
significantly improved. We postulate that this is due to a
combination of noncompliance with strict elevation , peripheral
edema from congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease
and diabetes. The patient continued to spike low grade
temperatures. We carried out pan culture which have all been
negative so far including urine , blood. At the time of this
dictation the patient has been on cefotaxime for seven days.
Infectious Disease recommends an MRI to rule out osteo and deeper
infection since the cellulitis is very slowly improving.
PROBLEM #2 , CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE AND CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:
On admission we started to diurese the patient as she was volume
overloaded by examination. In addition , we started her on her
outpatient blood pressure medications to control her hypertension.
However , on hospital day #2 , the patient&apos;s blood pressure dipped
into the high 90s to 100 with a rise in creatinine. We withheld
all blood pressure medication as well as diuresis. Her creatinine
continued to climb from 2.2 to 3.3. The urinalysis showed numerous
red blood cells and no eosinophils. Of note , her urine culture
grew out lactobacillus which was not treated. Renal was consulted ,
and it was thought that the patient&apos;s acute renal failure was due
to prerenal causes from a drop in blood pressure as well as mild
ATN. The patient&apos;s creatinine responded to gentle fluid boluses
and resolved on its own by hospital day #7. During the period of
acute renal failure , the patient also had marked hyponatremia which
also resolved as the renal function improved. The patient&apos;s
creatinine improved to 1.1 on hospital day #10. At this time , she
underwent a CT with contrast to delineate a possible liver mass.
Her subsequent creatinine climbed to 1.8. We had also started her
on her outpatient dose of enalapril and Lasix. We elected to
discontinue the enalapril and Lasix due to her increased
creatinine. We will observe and add back an ace inhibitor as
tolerated.
PROBLEM #3 , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST NON Q-WAVE
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The patient was admitted on a rule out
protocol. On her third set of enzymes she showed a CK of 142 , CK MB
of 2.2 but a troponin of 6.64. The patient was asymptomatic with
no chest pains and no electrocardiogram changes. Cardiology was
consulted and it was felt that the patient had a small non Q-wave
myocardial infarction with a troponin leak. A repeat echo on this
admission showed preserved EF at 55% with no observable wall motion
abnormalities. As the patient has refused catheterization in the
past , it was decided that she be managed medically. She was
started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d. as well as aspirin. The
patient has remained symptom free.
PROBLEM #4 , HYPERTENSION: The patient was initially slightly
hypotensive at a systolic blood pressure of 90s to 100 on hospital
day #1. Her enalapril and outpatient dose of Atenolol were held.
She was started back on Metoprolol after the non Q-wave myocardial
infarction. Currently , her blood pressure is maintained between
130-150 systolic. We attempted to add back enalapril at this time
to preserve her kidney function given her diabetes. However , her
creatinine increased mildly , thus we have elected to hold enalapril
again.
PROBLEM #5 , GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient has a history of chronic
constipation on home regimen of Dulcolax , senna , Colace and
lactulose. A KUB was obtained on admission which showed air in the
colon but no obstruction. It was thought that her chronic
distention is from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility.
The patient developed diarrhea during her hospital course for which
her laxatives were held. Her stool has been C. difficile negative.
She has tolerated very little food due to abdominal distention.
She has continued to advance her diet currently to some small
snacks during the day. Her laxatives were re-instituted. Because
the patient continued to spike a low grade temperature and she had
some abnormal liver function tests , we pursued a renal ultrasound
to rule out her renal abscess which was negative , as well as a
right upper quadrant ultrasound. The right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed a possible liver mass for which we ordered a
followup CT of the abdomen. The CT of the abdomen showed normal
variant of the shape of the liver , caused by a bowel loop that was
anterior to the liver. This is unchanged compared to a study that
she had in 1996.
PROBLEM #6 , ANEMIA: On admission the patient was slightly anemic
with a hematocrit of 30. During her past hospitalizations , the
patient always had a hematocrit around 30. On this admission her
stools were trace guaiac positive. She received two units of packed
red blood cell transfusion with an appropriate response to a
hematocrit of 36. GI was consulted. However , since the patient was
stable with no further decrease in the hematocrit , it was decided
that the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia in
terms of colonoscopy.
PROBLEM #7 , VASCULAR: The patient has a history of peripheral
vascular disease on admission. The Vascular Surgery service was
consulted to help manage refractory cellulitis. ABIs were obtained
of the right leg which showed 0.5 to 0.6 on the right lower
extremity and normal on the left lower extremity which has been
previously bypassed. Pulse volume recording revealed mildly
decreased signal in both the right and left leg. The conclusion
was that the patient had right femoral popliteal disease with
normal resting pressures on the left. However , as the patient is
not very mobile , she does not complain of any claudication
symptoms. It was decided that no surgery is indicated for her at
this time. We used heparin subcutaneous injections as her DVT
prophylaxis during her hospitalization.
PROBLEM #8 , CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has congestive
heart failure from diastolic dysfunction. On examination , she has
1+ edema throughout her body including her upper limbs in the chest
area. However , attempts at diuresis were aborted due to acute
renal failure. She continued to diurese on her own without any
pharmacologic interventions , as her creatinine improved. At this
time her Lasix is held because of a small bump in creatinine from
likely the contrast in CT as well as in the enalapril. Overall , she
is total body volume up , however , much improved from admission.
PROBLEM #9 , TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient&apos;s blood sugars
were poorly controlled during the hospitalization with finger
sticks in the high 100s to low 200s. This is partially due to the
patient&apos;s reluctance to take her full dose of NPH Insulin because
she is inconsistent with eating. She also has a sliding scale to
cover her. We will encourage her to continue with her full dose of
Insulin as she tolerates food better.
PROBLEM #10 , PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND LOW BACK PAIN: The
patient&apos;s Neurontin dose was reduced to 100 mg t.i.d. from her
outpatient dose of 300 mg t.i.d. due to renal insufficiency. She
also received Diazepam currently at 2.5 mg b.i.d. , reduced from her
outpatient dose of 5.5 mg b.i.d. because of renal insufficiency.
She also requires morphine sulfate on a p.r.n. basis. Her pain
control is satisfactory at the time of this dictation.

ATTENDING: MULLALY , DOMINIQUE THEO MD
This is an interim dictation from 7/3/06 through 04 while
the patient was on the General Medicine Service.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease likely due to her
diabetes mellitus. The patient&apos;s postoperative course was
significant for contrast induced oliguric acute renal failure. A
renal consult was obtained on 2/6/06 and the patient was seen
by Dr. Studdard to evaluate her acute on chronic renal failure.
Dr. Cowlin that her acute renal failure may be due to chronic
kidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due to
interstitial nephritis in the setting of a drug allergy. The
patient was also seen by Dr. Shope , Erik Garret Manuel F.
from the Nephrology Department while she was an inpatient. After
consideration of possibilities causing her acute renal failure ,
it was thought that her acute renal failure was most likely due
to cholesterol emboli syndrome given her eosinophilia , stepwise
progression of renal impairment and her chronic course. The
patient will need to be followed by a nephrologist as an
outpatient. In addition ,
the patient has known renal artery stenosis that may have
contributed to her acute renal failure and she did have a
possible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps a component of her
renal failure was also due to acute interstitial nephritis. On
1/27/06 , the patient developed gross hematuria. At this time ,
the urinalysis showed red blood cells but no evidence for
ATN. This gross hematuria was in the setting of a
worsened coagulopathy. She had a renal ultrasound at that time
that was negative for renal obstruction. Gradually with
resolution of her coagulopathy , the patient&apos;s urine output
increased and her creatinine improved with supportive measures
alone. The patient did have gradual improvement in her urine
output and her creatinine decreased to 2.8 prior to discharge.
The patient is currently off diuretics at this time. Daily
weights should be checked and if her weight increases by more
than 3 pounds Dr. Bockoven should be notified. The patient was also
started on calcitriol given elevation of parathyroid hormone.
Cardiovascular: Rate and rhythm: The patient has a history of
atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. The
patient was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.6 h. for rate
control , however , this dose was decreased to 12.5 mg p.o. twice a
day , given some bradycardia on her telemetry. The patient was
also started on Flecainide 75 mg p.o. q.12 h. She will continue
on these two medications upon discharge.
Congestive heart failure: The patient had evidence for
congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension during this
hospitalization. The patient did become volume overloaded on
physical examination with an oxygen requirement , elevation of her
JVP and shortness of breath. She was diuresed with Lasix during
her postoperative course. The patient was transferred to the
medical Service on 2/10/06 for management of her renal failure
and volume overload. The patient did undergo a trial of renally
dosed dopamine to see if this medication improved her cardiac
output and renal function. The patient showed no improvement on
this medication and it was discontinued after a short trial. The
patient&apos;s diuresis was discontinued prior to discharge as the
patient did have acute worsening of her renal function , which may
have been related to over aggressive diuresis. The patient was
instead started on spironolactone for management of her
congestive heart failure. As stated above , she should have daily
weights checked.
Ischemia: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease.
She was maintained on aspirin , statin and a beta-blocker during
the admission.
Hematology: The patient was started on iron supplementation for
her anemia in the setting of chronic kidney disease. The
patient&apos;s Coumadin was held briefly in the setting of a
coagulopathy that she developed on 1/27/06 .  The patient was
evaluated by the Hematology Service and was seen by Dr. Codilla and
Dr. Vallas from the Hematology Service for workup of her
coagulopathy. The patient had elevation of her INR to 5.8 and a
slight reduction in her hematocrit to 25 , as well as elevation of
her PTT to 97. Workup included factor 7 level , mixing study ,
anticardiolipin antibody , lupus anticoagulant , Von Willebrand&apos;s
panel , hepatitis B and C testing as well as complement levels.
The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells as well
as 2 units of FFP on 1/27/06 as well as vitamin K with much
improvement in her coagulopathy and increase in her hematocrit to
about 29. The patient should not receive any
heparin flushes. The patient showed no evidence for DIC or
hemolysis. Her coagulopathy was most likely thought to be due to
residual Coumadin with factor deficiency in the setting of her
decreased renal clearance. At this time , the results of the
inhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as an
outpatient. The patient was restarted on Coumadin prior to
discharge. Her INR goal is 2 to 3 and her Coumadin dosing should
be monitored by Dr. Hynum . Her current Coumadin dose is 1 mg
p.o. once every evening and her most recent INR 1.2. The patient
will follow up with Hematology as an outpatient.
Infectious Disease: The patient had a wound culture that grew
pseudomonas for which she was briefly treated with a course of
ceftazidime. The patient completed a course of ceftazidime and
remained afebrile off antibiotics with no signs of active
infection. A wound care consult was obtained for the patient&apos;s
decubitus ulcer. She should have DuoDERM dressing applied every
three days to her ulcer.
Pulmonary: The patient continues to have an oxygen requirement
despite diuresis. She did not show clinical signs of pneumonia.
Her oxygen requirement is thought to be due to atelectasis ,
deconditioning , as well as her known congestive heart failure and
likely pulmonary hypertension. She requires supplemental oxygen
at 2 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations in the
mid 90s. This should be continued at her rehabilitation.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and was
followed by the Diabetes Nursing Service during her stay. She
was on Avandia during the admission in addition to Lantus and
NovoLog before meals. Upon discharge , the patient will be on
Avandia 4 mg p.o. every noon as well as NovoLog 4 units
subcutaneous before every meals in addition to a NovoLog sliding
scale. The patient was also started on thyroid supplementation
and will be on Synthroid as an outpatient.
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had hyponatremia
thought to be in the setting of volume overload and total body
water excess. This improved somewhat with diuresis. In
addition , the patient developed dysphagia with liquids during her
hospitalization. She was evaluated by the Speech and Swallow
Service and had evidence of aspiration on bedside swallow
examination as well as video swallow examination. The patient
was also evaluated by the ENT Service and was seen by Dr.
Cassetty on 11/26/06 .  On laryngoscopy , she was found to have a
left vocal cord paralysis. She underwent MRI imaging of her neck
and chest. She did not have any evidence of mediastinal mass and
no abnormalities of the recurrent laryngeal nerve were seen.
Gradually , the patient has had some mild improvement in her
hoarseness and dysphagia. She benefits from turning her head to
the left with each swallow to minimize the risk of aspiration.
The patient was also followed by the Nutrition Service throughout
her hospital stay.
Vascular: The patient is status post left femoral distal bypass
on 8/21/06 .  The patient continued to be followed by the
Vascular Surgery Service during her hospitalization. She should
have three t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings applied to her left lower
extremity up to her thigh daily. She will follow up in Vascular
Clinic with Dr. Skreen in two weeks upon discharge.
Allergy: The patient had a DIURIL induced drug rash. She showed
no signs of mucous membrane involvement and no signs of
Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI as well as her
Coumadin.
Disposition: The patient was followed by the Physical Therapy
Service while an inpatient and will benefit from inpatient
rehabilitation.

Discharge Date: 3/27/2002
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sciatica.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Forty-six-year-old fell out of bed
yesterday reaching for something. She
fell on her coccyx. She had no loss of consciousness , no head
trauma. She was unable to get up secondary to pain and body
habitus. EMS was called and returned patient to bed , however , she
refused to come into the hospital in spite of her pain. The
following morning she was still with consider lower back and
buttock pain radiating to her right leg. She took her normal
oxycodone and Vicodin doses without relief , and EMS brought the
patient to the hospital. The patient states that pain is like
previous episodes of sciatica , radicular pain , but exacerbated by
her fall. In the emergency department , patient was afebrile , vital
signs stable. She received Ativan , Motrin , Dilaudid with little
effect. Plain films were negative for fracture. She was unable to
ambulate , and therefore admitted.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , myocardial infarction non-Q-wave
September , 2001 , a MICU admission during that time , in September , 2001 ,
for urosepsis , diabetic ketoacidosis and this non-Q-wave MI. Also ,
sciatica with previous history of a herniated disc L5-S1 , question
obstructive sleep apnea with mild pulmonary hypertension by
previous echo.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy complicated by wound
infection.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor , Zestril , aspirin , Toprol , morphine , insulin
and Vicodin.
STUDIES: September , 2001 , MIBI showed an old , moderately sized MI
in mid LAD distribution with moderate residual
peri-infarct ischemia. An September , 2001 , echo showed left
ventricular ejection fraction 50% , hypokinesis in the inferior
septum , mildly enlarged RV , pulmonary artery pressures of 39 plus
RA , suggestive of mild pulmonary hypertension and mild MR and TR.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , labs were significant for a glucose
of 121 , creatinine 1.4 , baseline was one ,
potassium of 5.2 , CK of 355 , a UA with plus two leukocyte esterase ,
85 whites , plus two bacteria.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Patient had temperature of 99 , heart rate 67 ,
respirations of 17 , blood pressure 130/50 , and
saturation 97% on room air. She was in no distress. She was
obese. She had no head trauma. Her neck was supple , normal S1 ,
S2. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen
was markedly obese , positive bowel sounds , nontender. She had a
skin abrasion on her left elbow. She had no spinal tenderness , no
pelvic tenderness. She was unable to raise her right leg secondary
to pain. She did have pain with straight leg left on the right.
She had normal sensation in upper and lower extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted and was scheduled to undergo
an MRI for evaluation of acutely herniated disc
at an outside facility at Y Wau Topelum , secondary to not being able to
fit within the coils at our own facility. However , she was unable
to receive this MRI secondary to inability to have assistance with
transfer of her when she reached the facility. Initially , her pain
was managed with both immediate-release and sustained-release
morphine and Valium for spasm. She also received around-the-clock
high-dose NSAIDs and was evaluated by physical therapy and
nutrition. Her UTI was treated with Bactrim. On hospital day
three , her creatinine jumped to 2.9 from 1.4. She was also
hyperkalemic to 5.9. Her NSAIDs were stopped and Neurontin was
DCed secondary to somnolence. However , she continued to have
worsening renal failure , hypertension and somnolence , and blood gas
showed primary respiratory acidosis , hypercarbia and she was
ultimately transferred to the MICU for intubation for airway
protection secondary to aspiration. By April , her creatinine had
returned to baseline. She was extubated without complications.
Her renal function was presumed to be secondary high-dose NSAIDs ,
and her intubation was deemed to be secondary to a primary
respiratory acidosis from opioid intoxication exacerbated by renal
failure. Issues are as follows by systems:
Pulmonary: Overnight pulse oximetry was performed , which will be
analyzed to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. Patient will most
likely need a form of sleep study at rehabilitation or as an
outpatient to address this obstructive sleep apnea issue. Data
from this admission do not support a diagnosis of obesity
hypoventilation syndrome , because there was no daytime hypercapnia
by both ABGs and Chem-7 panel.
Renal: Acute renal insufficiency resolved with hydration ,
withdrawal of NSAIDs. We will hold her ACE inhibitor secondary to
recent renal failure , and she will need to have this evaluated in
two weeks or so.
Infectious disease: The patient with low-grade fevers on empiric
Levofloxacin and Flagyl day seven of 14 for aspiration pneumonia
suffered during hypocarbic respiratory arrest. The patient was
also placed on two days of vancomycin , after one of the blood
cultures in the ICU grew coagulase negative Staph. All cultures
since then have been negative. Patient also had two episodes of
liquid stool on Flagyl , day six. She was already receiving therapy
for C. difficile. Because she has been in the hospital more than
three days , an O&amp;P is very low yield. Stool cultures and a repeat
chest x-ray will be done if clinical worsens tomorrow.
Neurologic: Patient with known small right lateral recess disc
herniation impinging on right nerve root at L5-S1. She has
previous received steroid injections for this and has refused
surgery secondary to very bad experience with the total abdominal
hysterectomy complicated by wound infection. She has had an acute
exacerbation of this pain with her fall. We were unable to obtain
an MRI at outside facility because of her body habitus and need for
assistance with movement. She would benefit from aggressive PT and
pain control with eventual surgery if these more conservative
measures fail.
Pain: The patient was oversedated on pain medications and was
actually intubated for the need to balance desire to alleviate pain
with need for patient to have adequate respiratory drive.
Endocrine: Continue NPH and CZI and ADA diet. Will begin Meridia.
Patient also seen by nutrition and was given number for weight loss
program.
CV: Non-Q-wave MI in September , 2001. Patient with preserved EF , no
valve disease. Will continue current cardiac regimen. Will need
to restart ACE inhibitor in two to three weeks , now that renal
failure resolved.
Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous Heparin , Protime pump inhibitor , and
Dulcolax and Lactulose p.r.n. for constipation while on narcotics.
Social: I have written a letter regarding the patient&apos;s need for
first-floor apartment secondary to inability to use stairs. It is
in her chart.
Additional comments: Please monitor patient carefully for
oversedation on current medications. Patient will need sleep study
to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.

Discharge Date: 6/12/2005
ATTENDING: UHAS , FRANKLYN M.D.
SERVICE:
General Medicine Ent Ster Villepeakechatdar
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Hematemesis.
PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED DURING THE HOSPITALIZATION:
Hematemesis , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; uncontrolled ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , acute renal failure due
to NSAID abuse , hypothyroidism , paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia with rapid ventricular response , gastroesophageal
disease , hiatal hernia , and Barrett&apos;s esophagitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 75-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent , as well as a history of CHF and
supraventricular tachycardia in addition to a history of
gastroesophageal reflux disease , hiatal hernia and esophageal
stricture status post three dilations in the remote past. She
was recently discharged from the Tohall Villeviewtrom Moralb Medical Center on
10/8/05 after admission for UTI and acute renal failure in the
setting of NSAID abuse because of low back pain. She was
discharged to the nursing home on that day and experienced mild
nausea and emesis that evening. Her symptoms progressed over the
night and continued throughout the next day , and she presented
with complaints of coffee-ground emesis without melena ,
dizziness , orthostasis , or palpitations. She has no abdominal
pain , diarrhea , or constipation. She did have a history of sick
contact , her previous roommate , during the hospitalization had
gastroenteritis. Therefore , on 9/29/05 , she was transferred
from the nursing home to the Baview Hospital And Medical Center for
evaluation of the hematemesis.
PERTINENT REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She denied any symptoms of orthostasis. She denied any visual
complaints , dizziness , or imbalance. She had no incontinence ,
dysuria , frequency , or urgency. She had no chest pain and no
shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
NPH subcutaneously 35 units q.a.m. , NPH subcutaneously 10 units
q.p.m. , NovoLog sliding scale , Reglan 5 mg by mouth twice a day ,
Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice a day for 14 days and then once
daily , Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day , Tylenol 1000
mg by mouth three times a day , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg inhaled
as needed , Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Lipitor 10 mg by mouth
daily , PhosLo 667 mg by mouth before meals , Synthroid 200 mcg by
mouth daily , miconazole nitrate 2% cream twice a day application ,
Actonel 35 mg by mouth once a week , on Sunday , Detrol LA 4 mg by
mouth daily , nifedipine XL , and Neurontin 300 mg by mouth daily.
ALLERGIES:
Include albuterol , which causes supraventricular tachycardia ,
penicillin causes rash , ibuprofen , which causes acute renal
failure , and sulfa drugs , which cause an unknown reaction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , the physical exam was notable for temperature 96.2 ,
heart rate 87 , blood pressure 146/90 , respiratory rate 20 , and O2
sat on room air is 93%. Her general physical examination showed
no icterus and no conjunctivae pallor. Pulmonary exam was
benign. Cardiovascular exam showed regular rate and rhythm , S1 ,
S2 , occasional pauses , but good peripheral pulses. Abdominal
exam showed an obese abdomen , normoactive bowel sounds , soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. The exam of the extremities showed
pitting edema to the knee , otherwise was nontender and she has
good muscle strength throughout. The neurological exam was
nonfocal. The vomitus was examined and it was shown to be
gastroccult negative.
LABORATORY DATA:
Pertinent laboratory findings showed sodium of 140 , chloride of
102 , bicarbonate of 19 , creatinine of 2.6 , down from max of over
6 , anion gap 19 , glucose on chemistry 351 , normal liver test ,
hematocrit of 36.8 within her normal range , and normal coags.
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES PERFORMED NOT IN OR:
She had an upper GI series on 8/30/05 , a video swallow on
1/19/05 , and upper endoscopy on 11/6/05 .
HOSPITAL COURSE:
In summary , in terms of the hematemesis from the GI standpoint ,
there was no blood shown in the emesis during the
hospitalization. Her symptoms were treated with Reglan ,
initially IV than p.o. The differential diagnosis on admission
was gastroenteritis due to sick contacts , gastritis secondary to
pervious history of NSAID use , ulcer , recurrent esophageal
stricture , other enteritis or DKA given elevated glucose levels
and anion gap on admission. Other things considered were
atypical cardiac ischemia. In order to evaluate the cause of the
hematemesis , she underwent the barium swallow on 8/30/05 .
Unfortunately , this test was canceled prematurely due to evidence
of aspiration on the initial swallow. She was kept n.p.o. from
10/21/05 to 07 until video swallow could be performed ,
which showed minimal aspiration with swallowing , but was
improved with chin tuck maneuver. An initial diet of mechanical
soft with liquids was recommended with advancement as necessary.
GI was consulted , Dr. Costine attending , and upper endoscopy
was performed on 11/6/05 , which showed nonerosive esophagitis
and a hiatal hernia , both known by history , otherwise , there was
no ulcerations and no stricture. The emesis subsided during the
hospitalization. She was continued on Nexium while in-house as
well as Reglan p.r.n. and tolerated regular house feeds prior to
discharge with no emesis. As an aside , she developed diarrhea
while in-house. Given history of pervious antibiotic use for
UTI , C. diff cultures were sent , both are pending at this time.
The suspicion is low. She is being treated with Imodium p.r.n.
In terms of her history of acute renal failure , the creatinine
had continued to decrease through her hospitalization , but after
aggressive diuresis , she had slight increase in her creatinine ,
but this responded well to reducing the rate of Lasix and mild
hydration. From a cardiovascular standpoint , her hospital stay
was complicated by two distinct episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia with rapid ventricular response , one on 11/27/05 and
one on 9/9/05 .  The event on 11/27/05 occurred at 5:00 p.m.
with heart rates in 200 range. She was treated with Lopressor 5
mg followed by diltiazem 20 mg x2 , which then caused reduction in
the heart rate to the 90s. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. was then
added to her regimen. On 9/9/05 , at 2:00 a.m. , she had heart
rate to the 160s , again was treated with diltiazem 20 mg IV x1
and her heart rate decreased to the 90s. At that time , her
diltiazem dose was increased to 90 mg q.i.d. From an infectious
disease standpoint , there were no obvious infections diagnosed
during this stay , but the results of stool cultures are pending.
Her pulmonary status remained stable with good O2 saturation on
room air throughout the hospitalization. From an endocrine
standpoint , her diabetes was moderately controlled during her
hospitalization. She was switched from her standing NPH to
regular insulin sliding scale while n.p.o. because of low blood
sugars. After initiating p.o. intake , her sugars were initially
uncontrolled and aggressively managed with Regular Insulin
sliding scale in addition to an NPH standing regimen. Upon
discharge , Ms. Azen was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , range
68-93 , normotensive with the blood pressure of 120/50 with good
O2 saturation on room air of 93%. Her cardiac and pulmonary
exams were benign. Abdomen exam was also benign , but symptoms of
loose bowel movements were still notable without abdominal pain.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , headache , or
temperature , diltiazem 90 mg p.o. four times a day , Lasix 40 mg
by mouth daily , NPH 10 units subcutaneously nightly , NPH 40 units
subcutaneously q.a.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled four
times a day , Synthroid 200 mcg p.o. daily , Imodium 2 mg p.o.
q.6h. , Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Reglan 10 mg by mouth four
times a day as needed for nausea , Lipitor 10 mg by mouth daily ,
Protonix 40 mg by mouth daily , KCl slow release 20 mEq by mouth
twice a day , miconazole nitrate 2% powder topical TP b.i.d. , and
NovoLog sliding scale subcutaneously before meals and at bedtime.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: CHEST PAIN , SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old woman with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , HTN , IPF and some CAD who presents with the first episode
of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient first
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest pressure and severe
shortness of breath five days prior to admission which resolved in
one hour but continued to have some substernal chest pain and
dyspnea on exertion with even mild exertion , i.e , crossing the
room. This occurred over the next several days. The patient
described the substernal chest pressure as being like hit in the
chest and this lasted about fifteen minutes. The patient did have
some nausea and vomiting associated with her symptoms and was most
comfortable sitting up. The patient did continue to have increased
shortness of breath at rest and worsened dyspnea on exertion with
around two episodes per day of severe chest pressure/dyspnea/pain
that required her to remain still over the next five days. She
also noted diaphoresis with all those episodes. She denied any
fever , chills , URI symptoms , cough , change in bowel movements. The
patient did complain of some bilateral foot edema 1-2 weeks prior
to admission. The patient has had stable two-pillow orthopnea and
notes no weight gain or loss , but notes decreased exercise
tolerance over the past month. The patient presented to her
primary care physician today secondary to continued shortness of
breath and was sent to the emergency department where
electrocardiogram revealed some ST depressions anterolaterally with
a troponin leak with a troponin level of 0.19 and was thus admitted
to the cardiology Memp Mont service.

HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65-year-old female with a history of
coronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes ,
IPF who presented with five days of chest pain/SOB beginning with
sudden onset five days prior to admission and had EKG changes
consistent with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction anterolaterally.
Of note her troponin was 0.19. The differential diagnosis included
unstable angina and PE with worsening IPF superimposed on heart
disease. From a cardiovascular standpoint the patient has known
coronary artery disease with EKG changes which is likely status
post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a question of continued
unstable angina. The patient was initially put on aspirin ,
Lopressor 37.5 t.i.d. , heparin , oxygen and hooked up to a cardiac
monitor and EKG q.d. and was ruled out for enzymes. The patient
underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed LAD ostial 90% ,
proximal 80% , diag ostial 90% , left circ 90% , 80% lesions , marginal
1 , TUB 90% , RCA 50%. The patient underwent PTCA and stent x 2 with
good results. The patient remained chest pain free and had no
chest pain on exertion , i.e. , with ambulation. The echo showed
preserved left ventricular function with a good ejection fraction.
The ejection fraction was found to be 55%. There was no discrete
evidence of wall motion abnormality although the inferior and
posterior segments were not well visualized. There was left
ventricular hypertrophy. There was stromal mild right ventricular
hypertrophy and overall right heart function appeared to be
preserved. There was trivial to 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with
right heart pressures within normal limits. There was thickened
aortic leaflets with trivial central insufficiency and no evidence
of any outflow tract obstruction. There was similar mild mitral
regurgitation with the elliptic ring , the left atrial size was
slightly increased and there was no evidence of any effusion. From
a pulmonary standpoint the patient had LENIs which were negative
for a deep venous thrombosis. PFCs revealed a restrictive
physiology and poor diffusion consistent with IPF. The FEV1 was
69% predicted , TLC was 63% predicted , with a DLCO of 56% predicted.
The patient did have a retrocardiac infiltrate on chest x-ray and
the patient was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. for fourteen
days. From a GI perspective the patient had a history of colonic
polyps but tolerated the aspirin and was put on Nexium prophylaxis.
The patient was hypokalemic on 3/19 with a curious whitening on
EKG and peak T waves. The patient was treated with insulin , given
calcium and treated with Kayexalate x 3 and the hypokalemia quickly
resolved. The origin of the hypokalemia was unclear. The patient
did have an elevated potassium with a low bicarb which was
consistent with a type 4 RTA and also had hypoglycemia which was
then treated with prednisone overnight for IV contrast dye allergy.
The patient was also on Captopril which was discontinued secondary
to her renal issues.

Discharge Date: 1/21/2005
ATTENDING: REOPELL , ROLF M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
This is the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is
sinus arrest with apnea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy ( EF of 55% on this admission , although
prior admission indicating an EF of 35% ) , diabetes , obstructive
sleep apnea , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , atrial flutter
status post ablation. On 5/24/05 , he presented with shortness
of breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode. His recent
history is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one week
prior to admission due to increased frustration with
incontinence. Since then , he has had increasing shortness of
breath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertion
to the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet. In the Centsshealt Careman Inerist Medical Center Emergency Department , he was found to be
saturating 91% on room air and 99% on a nonrebreather. An ABG
showed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55; he was tried on BiPAP
without improvement in either PCO2 or PO2. While being
interviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a
30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis;
his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although he
retained no memory of this occurrence. He received Lasix 80 mg
x1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED. He was admitted to the
CCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequently
transferred to the hospital floor when he was stable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
2/13 echo with an EF of 35% and global left ventricular
hypokinesis; 7/18 echo with an EF of 55% , without hypokinesis.
2. Atrial flutter , status post ablation ( 2003 ).
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Hyperostosis frontalis.
5. Complex renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma , resected via
laparoscopy in 8/2 .
6. Morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 2 ).
MEDICATIONS:
1. Allopurinol.
2. Iron.
3. Lisinopril.
4. Toprol-XL.
5. Coumadin ( discontinued on 11/28/05 ).
6. Albuterol inhaler p.r.n.
7. Aspirin.
8. Flomax.
9. Hytrin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives alone at Rys Ville Santster He is a retired Burg Bovalle Ge
employee. He is an ex-smoker , quit in the 1960s. He is a heavy
drinker in his 20s , but now he rarely drinks alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Gastric cancer in his father.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature of 96 , pulse of 53 , blood pressure of 125/65 , and
saturating 94% on 2 liters by nasal cannula. In general , alert
and oriented , in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils are equally
round and reactive to light , sclerae are anicteric , moist mucous
membranes. Cardiovascular exam: Regular rate and rhythm , normal
S1 and S2 , although JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus.
Lung exam: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no wheezes or
crackles. Abdomen: Obese , soft and nontender , normal abdominal
bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
Notable for creatinine of 2.3 ( at baseline ) , BNP of 500. His
admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia to the
40s , no ST changes.
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
Assessment and Plan: A 71-year-old female with a history of
obesity hypoventilation syndrome , restrictive lung disease ,
diabetes , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF ,
who was admitted for congestive heart failure , sinus arrest ,
ultimately treated with diuresis and a pacemaker placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: No active issues during this
hospitalization. Pump: The patient had a history nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , ( an echo during this
hospitalization revealed an EF of 55% without hypokinesis ,
although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35% with global left
ventricular hypokinesis ). On admission , the patient had signs
and symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not taken
his Lasix for about a week. He was admitted initially to the
CCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressive
diuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission ( including
diuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU ). Following transfer to
the floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrated
down gradually to 40 mg daily , ( cautioned with administration
giving a rise in creatinine ). The patient was also maintained on
captopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. ( held at one
point due to the rise in the creatinine ). The patient was also
titrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient
was followed by the Electrophysiology Service. In the CCU , he
was noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting of
apnea. Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to have
sinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. His
last such episode was on 8/16/05 .  In addition , the patient has
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. On
4/30/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalic
veins , which he tolerated well.
2. Pulmonary: The patient , as noted above , had several episodes
of apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest.
Following diuresis , the patient&apos;s apnea episodes improved. He
was recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient.
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughly
around baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during his
hospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 4/30/05 .  His FENa on
admission was 6-8%; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peak
serum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was
1.86%. His urine eosinophils were negative. His UA showed
evidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals; urine culture
showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. It was
thought that the rise in the patient&apos;s creatinine was likely due
to a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI.
The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemaker
placement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial flora
and SNHU microbes.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a history of diabetes and was
maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale.
5. ID: The patient was expected to having an UTI as noted
above. Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed on
cefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex. The patient should
stay on Keflex for four days.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing.
2. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.
3. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. daily.
6. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
7. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.
8. Regular Insulin sliding scale subcutaneous q.a.c.

EKG remarkable for atrial fibrillation with a rate of 82 , Q-waves
in V1 and V2 without ST changes , low voltage. His T-wave was
upright in V2 and V3 which is changed from his prior EKG in
11/26 .  Chest x-ray notable for pericardial effusion which
shows increase in size and question of fluid at the bilateral
bases.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Mr. Inskeep is a 74-year-old man with severe venous stasis , CHF ,
atrial fibrillation requiring Coumadin , COPD , severe left lower
extremity cellulitis status post surgical debridement who
presents with shortness of breath and recurrent left lower
extremity cellulitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had some pseudonormalization in
V2 , V3. He was ruled out for MI. He was continued on his
aspirin and Zocor. His CK was noted to be increasing , but he was
clinically unchanged , and there was low suspicion for necrotizing
fasciitis or myositis. He was not felt to be cardiac in origin.
The patient has right heart failure. He was overloaded on exam.
His JVP was difficult to assess given his history of tricuspid
regurgitation. He did have enlarged heart on his chest x-ray and
an echo on 1/3/06 showed a precordial fat-pad without effusion.
His EF was unchanged. His PA pressure was 35+ RA. His IVC was
nonpulsatile suggesting increased RA pressures. He responded to
Lasix 80 mg IV. He was not diuresed on this admission. He was
continued on his home dose of Lasix at 80 mg p.o. twice daily.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has no need for rate
control at this time. Coumadin was held for GI bleeding that the
patient developed on 6/10/06 .  He had an episode of hematemesis
in the setting of an INR of 3 which was thought to be a
Mallory-Weiss tear from coughing. His hematocrit stabilized at
27. His fibrinogen D-dimer were normal. He was made n.p.o. ,
received four units of FFP and 2 units of packed red cells. An
NG tube was placed which has been since removed. The GI Service
recommended an IV proton pump inhibitor. On 11/9/06 , his diet
was advanced. He was tolerating that well and his hematocrits
were stable at this point.
3. Respiratory: The patient had wheeziness on exam when he was
admitted. He received DuoNebs q.6h. and on exam , his wheeziness
resolved.
4. ID: The patient has recurrent cellulitis secondary to venous
stasis. Cultures from the debridement in 11/26 were negative.
Blood cultures drawn p.r.n. 6/7/06 were positive for
acinetobacter diphtheroids. Wound cultures of the left leg
showed 2+ acinetobacter , beta streptococcus group G
corynebacterium. From the right leg , he grew 2+ MRSA ,
corynebacterium and beta strep. The organisms were sensitive to
levofloxacin , his staph aureus MRSA. Blood culture 6/10/06 is
no growth to date at the time of this dictation. Stool on
6/10/06 was positive for C. diff and urine culture 1/3/06
showed Gram-negative rods. Surgical Service recommended
antibiotic treatment. The patient was started on vancomycin
( started 6/7/06 ) , levofloxacin ( started 6/7/06 ) , aztreonam
was added on 1/3/06 for Acinetobacter in his blood. He
was given gentamicin x1 on 6/10/06 in the setting of
hypotension. He will continue vancomycin and levofloxacin for
four weeks and will stop on 6/13/06 .  He will continue Flagyl
for six weeks ( started 8/27/06 to stop on 10/11/07 for his C.
diff ). The wound culture from his bilateral lower extremities is
polymicrobial. If the erythema spread , he becomes febrile , or his
legs become more tender , please have a low threshold for
noncontrast CT and surgical consultation. Lower extremity
Dopplers were negative for DVT but there is incomplete
visualization at all of his left leg veins.
5. Renal: The patient had acute on chronic renal failure ,
( baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1 ) , hyponatremia , hyperkalemia on
admission. There was some question of adrenal insufficiency but
he had a normal random cortisol. His fractional excretion of
urea was 26% and he has since been volume resuscitated. His
creatinine responded accordingly.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient has been on Coumadin that was held
in the setting of GI bleed. We have held his Lovenox as well.
He is on an oral proton pump inhibitor.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is DNR/DNI. Pressors are okay. Healthcare proxy is
Hal Feucht who is his sister 624-913-9792.
CONSULTS:
GI: Dr. Nagai . ID: Dr. Furr . Surgery: Dr. Myles Messel .
TO DO:
1. Continue IV antibiotics.
2. Follow up all cultures.
3. Resume Coumadin.
4. Continue prophylactic Lovenox.
5. Have the patient follow up with his primary care doctor in
one to two weeks after discharge from rehabilitation.
6. Have him follow up with the GI Service in one to two weeks
after rehabilitation.
DIET:
The patient should measure his weight daily. He should be fluid
restricted to 2 liters daily. He should on a low-cholesterol ,
low-fat , 2 grams sodium diet.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Rosenburg is a 58-year-old
gentleman with significant medical history of past acute
myocardial infarction in 1994 who presented with complaints of
substernal chest pressure for 2 days on 6/19/2005 .  The patient
stated that the pain was substernal in nature with radiation to
the left side. It was 3-4/10 in intensity. The pain resolved
spontaneously. The patient after sometime has a similar brief
episode of substernal chest pressure that made him come to the
hospital where he was found to have a troponin level of 0.29 with
flat CPK and MB. He was admitted to Oncrest Hospital during
his previous heart attack where he had a PTCA done of his left
anterior descending coronary artery. He underwent cardiac
catheterization on 6/19/2005 , which revealed a left main coronary

Discharge Date: 8/3/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA/CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HYPERTENSION.
2 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
3 ) TOBACCO USE.
4 ) DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old woman
with longstanding hypertension ,
coronary artery disease ( status post two vessel coronary artery
bypass graft in 1992 ) , hypercholesterolemia , positive tobacco use ,
positive family history for coronary artery disease , adult onset
diabetes mellitus , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , peptic
ulcer disease ( with history of gastrointestinal bleed ) , and stable
angina who presented with rest angina in a crescendo pattern not
relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient had no chest
pain history until 1992 when she presented with chest pain and had
a markedly positive exercise tolerance test. She had recurrent
typical chest pain and fatigue at 3 minutes and 45 seconds on
standard Bruce protocol with a maximal heart rate of 129 , maximal
blood pressure 120/80 , and 1 mm ST depressions. Patient was
treated medically but returned with chest pain at rest. Cardiac
catheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80%
mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but was
complicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenous
vein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the left
anterior descending. Patient was on an intraaortic balloon pump
when she developed a cold right lower extremity and had an emergent
right femorofemoral bypass. The patient did well until 2/11 ( with
rare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina which
began approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graft
and were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when she
developed worsening right lower extremity claudication requiring
angioplasty. In 4/17 , recurrent right lower extremity
claudication prompted a femoropopliteal bypass. The patient was
now currently contemplating repeat femoropopliteal bypass. On the
day of admission , the patient had an approximately four hour
episode of chest pain while visiting with her daughter. The
patient did not have sublingual nitroglycerin with her at the time.
Upon returning home , the patient obtained relief with one
sublingual nitroglycerin ( patient had described the pain at 9/10
with left chest to axilla pain and no other radiation ). The
patient was able to sleep. The patient awoke in the morning and
shortly thereafter , had chest pain which was not relieved with one
sublingual nitroglycerin. Therefore , the patient came to the
Emergency Department. The patient had repeat episodes of chest
pain while in the Emergency Department and no EKG changes were
noted. Two sublingual nitroglycerins resolved each episode.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Longstanding hypertension. 2 ) Peptic
ulcer disease/upper gastrointestinal bleed
in the 1970s. The patient had an upper GI series/colonoscopy which
were negative per the patient. The patient had an ongoing stable
pattern of gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease that was
minimized by avoiding fatty foods. 3 ) Adult onset diabetes
mellitus. 4 ) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no
hospitalizations or intubations and currently not on any therapy.
5 ) Hypercholesterolemia. 6 ) Vascular disease as above. 7 )
Status post herniated disc.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg/25 mg/50 mg , Pepcid 20
b.i.d. , Procardia XL 60 q.d. , enteric coated
aspirin 500 mg q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. , Elavil 50 mg
q.h.s. , and K-Dur 20 mEq q.d.
ALLERGIES: 1 ) Amoxicillin which caused hives and a rash. 2 )
Fish which caused nausea , vomiting , and pruritus.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was a retired operating room
technician. 2 ) Patient had significant tobacco
use of three packs per day times 35 years decreased to one pack per
day in the last two years. 3 ) Alcohol was none since 1992 with
one beer per night prior to that.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother who died of a cerebrovascular accident ,
otherwise non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This revealed an obese middle-aged woman who
was feisty but in no acute distress. Her
temperature was 98.2 , heart rate 84 , blood pressure 122/74 , and
respiratory rate 16. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact , pupils
equally round and reactive to light ( but left slower to react ) and
oropharynx benign. NECK: No lymphadenopathy , thyromegaly without
nodular feeling , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugular venous
pressure approximately 7 cm. LUNGS: Coarse dry crackles at the
bilateral bases with decreased breath sounds throughout. CARDIAC:
Point of maximal intensity was not appreciated , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , S2 was split , and no S3 , S4 , or murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended , obese with no
hepatosplenomegaly , and no femoral artery bruits with 1+ palpable
pulses bilaterally. EXTREMITIES: Trace pretibial edema
bilaterally with 1+ right dorsalis pedis pulse and trace left
dorsalis pedis pulse. RECTAL: Occult blood negative ( per
Emergency Department physician ). NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focal
except for 4/5 right lower extremity proximal muscle strength , 1+
deep tendon reflexes throughout , and toes downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 49 and first CK of 19. Chest x-ray
showed no active disease. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm of 90 ,
axis 70 degrees , normal intervals , no ST or T wave changes , no left
ventricular hypertrophy , and no change as compared with 4/17 .
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was first ruled out for a myocardial
infarction and the patient did , in fact , rule
out. The patient did have some recurrent chest pain episodes
in-house , again with no EKG changes , relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. Her anti-ischemic regimen was intensified and the
patient underwent a dobutamine MIBI which revealed inferior
ischemia with a minimal work-load. Cardiac catheterization
revealed that her saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery
had stenosed which was successfully PTCA to 20% residual stenosis.
Slow competitive flow was seen in the LIMA but the LIMA to the left
anterior descending was patent. The patient did well
post-procedure.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home with close follow-up by
her primary physician.

ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , aortic valve and
mitral valve dysfunction.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is 59-year-old female who is
status post mitral valve repair , aortic valve repair , history of
endocarditis , history of rheumatic heart disease , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and congestive heart failure who presents with
increasing shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal
pain. She has been under significant stress at home since last
summer and notes slowly declining health since that time. She
has had increasing shortness of breath as well as dyspnea on
exertion since September 2004 and has gotten worse in the past one
month , and even significantly worse in the past week. The
patient notes increasing lower extremity edema on the right side
greater than the left. She states that this is her baseline with
the right side being more than the left. She has no increase in
her abdominal girth , the patient has two-to three-pillow
orthopnea ( from one-pillow orthopnea , one month ago ) , she does
have some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , she has no increased
nocturia. The patient notes that the shortness of breath is &quot;not
angina; I do not have that.&quot; She does not have any
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , or radiation of pain. The patient
says that she does not check her weigh at home , but &quot;knows&quot; she
is in failure when she is short of breath. She also notes
nausea , vomiting , and some abdominal pain stating that it started
about a week and a half ago. She had gone to see the ED on the
Sunday prior to admission where the patient reportedly had a
benign exam , low-grade temperature , given recent Levaquin for an
upper respiratory tract infection , she was then started on Flagyl
for a possible C. difficile infection. The patient&apos;s diarrhea
stopped , but she had still remained some abdominal pain and
increased cough , which was nonproductive. She went to her PCP on
the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath and was
sent to the ED for diuresis. In the ED , she was given 60 mg of
IV Lasix with good output per report. She did have some decrease
in her shortness of breath shortly thereafter. She also
complained of 10/10 abdominal pain and was given some Dilaudid.
On the floor during the interview , she did have some projectile
vomiting. She was able to pass gas. She reported no fevers ,
chills , or night sweats. She reported no bright red blood per
rectum. She reported no change in her bowel , bladder , or urinary
habits.

LABORATORY EXAM ON ADMISSION: Sodium 126 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 93 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.4 with a
baseline of 1.2 and 1.3 , glucose 160. CBC is notable for a white
blood cell count of 9.9 , hematocrit 27.9 , platelet count 274 , 000.

alkaline phosphatase is 52 , total bilirubin 0.1 , albumin 4.2 , and
total protein 7.4.
STUDIES: Her EKG showed no change. It was in junctional rhythm
at 65 beats per minute. She had frequent PVCs. There was a
normal access. There were some nonspecific T-wave inversions.
CHEST X-RAY: Showed mild vascular congestion. There was no
evidence of any effusion.
IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a rheumatic heart
disease , status post St. Jude&apos;s MVR and AVR , congestive heart
failure who presents with mild volume overload and abdominal pain
with nausea and vomiting.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: When the patient was admitted , she was ruled out
for an MI. She did have a slight increase of her troponins ,
which were attributed to mild demand ischemia. In addition , she
had some slight anemia , which could also be contributed to the
demand as well in addition to the clear volume overload. She did
fine from the standpoint , had no ST changes on any of her EKGs.
The patient laid her head workup for future AVR and MVR with the
Surgical Service , with Dr. Bio . Her workup was extensive and
included a cardiac catheterization , which showed no significant
coronary artery disease. The hemodynamics were notable for the
following: RA of 12 , PA of 92/23/44 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 22 with V waves to 42. The mitral valve was grossly
normal with appropriate leaflet motion. The AV was also grossly.
The overall conclusion was elevated right-sided heart pressures.
She had no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of the
coronary arteries.
b. Pump: Please see cath report as above. The patient was
admitted and diuresed with IV Lasix , so she came down to a
euvolemic state. Her diuresis was continued with 80 mg IV Lasix
on a b.i.d. basis. She was diuresed until there was a subsequent
bump in her creatinine to 1.8 , 1.9. After that point , diuresis
was slowly modified. She was then placed back on a regimen of
120 mg of p.o. Lasix q.o.d. That is the dosing of Lasix on which
she is discharged.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation that has been rate controlled with a beta-blocker.
On admission , her digoxin was stopped. She was evaluated by the
EP Service. They recommended epicardial lead placement at
surgery due to her tachybrady syndrome. The patient was
discharged on diltiazem 30 mg q.i.d. She will have her
medications modified status post her valvular repair in the very
near future.
d. Presurgical workup: In addition to echo , right and left
heart cath , the patient had a TEE performed. TEE showed normal
left atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus.
St. Jude&apos;s valve was well seated in the aortic position. There
was no significant aortic regurg that was noted. A St. Jude&apos;s
valve was well seated in the mitral position as well. There was
trace mild regurgitation noted. There was slight asynchronous
motion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted. The
tricuspid valve was normal in appearance. There was mild
regurgitation present. Visualized portion of the thoracic aorta
revealed minimal atheromatous plaque.
2. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from her pulmonary
standpoint. She continued to sat well on room air. She did not
required any nebulizers during her stay.
3. GI: The patient was initially admitted with some abdominal
pain and also nausea and vomiting. She had a KUB performed for a
question of potential bowel obstruction. A single frontal view
of the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the final
radiology report. There was gas seen within the loops of small
bowel as well as the colon. There is no bowel dilatation seen.
The overall impression was no evidence of any high-grade bowel
obstruction. It is likely that some of her pain was secondary to
hepatic congestion. The nausea and vomiting eventually resolved
and perhaps this is some type of viral illness or
gastroenteritis. She did have some episode of diarrhea prior to
admission along with some abdominal cramping. The patient was
continued on her PPI for GERD prophylaxis. At one point , she
required increasing her dosage of Nexium secondary to GERD-like
symptoms. It seemed that increasing the amount of Nexium she
received , precipitated some diarrhea. She was returned to a
normal dosing of Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. while in-house. She was
discharged on omeprazole 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which she will
continue to take as an outpatient. In addition , she was given
prescription for Colace and also Senokot today. She should
continue using.
4. Heme: Her hematocrit remained relatively stable during her
stay with averaging of 26 to 27 as far as her hematocrit. We
were not concerned with keeping her hematocrit 30 or above at all
times given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left and
also right heart catheterization. She did have a slight dip in
her hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed red
blood cells. Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 30 or 31.
She required no subsequent transfusions thereafter. With regard
to anticoagulation , she was placed on the heparin drip at 950
units per hour to maintain a PTT between 60 and 80 secondary to
her mechanical valves that are in place. On discharge , the
patient was transitioned to Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. with a renal
dosing. She will continue to take this Lovenox as an outpatient
and stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed.
She has home VNA in place.
5. Renal: Her BUN and creatinine was relatively stable on
admission. It did elevate to as high as 3.3 , 3.4 on her
admission secondary to her ongoing diuresis. When diuresis was
held for several days given her markedly increased urine output
and as she became more hydrated and euvolemic , her creatinine
returned to its baseline of 1.2 , 1.3. She has no active issues
now.
6. Endocrine: We appreciated the Diabetes Service for following
her very closely while in-house. Several modifications were made
to her regimen while here to get good control of her blood
glucose. She was maintained on a stable regimen of NPH 60 units
in the morning , NPH 30 units in the evening. She also was placed
on a sliding scale. She also received NovoLog of 15 units in the
morning with breakfast and also 15 at dinner. She was not
receiving any of the NovoLog while at lunch. She will continue
to take this regimen in home. All of her prescriptions were
provided by Carl Mcclenahan , who is following with the Diabetes
Service. They will become again involved with her care as she
plans for surgery in the very near future.
7. Infectious disease: The patient was stable from an ID
standpoint during her entire admission. On September , 2005 , the
patient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cell
count upwards towards the 20 , 000. This was one day prior to a
planned surgery on April , 2005 with Dr. Villata to repair her
aortic valve and also her mitral valve. The surgery was delayed
as a result of this , so an infectious workup could ensue. She
had a urine sent that showed , the suggestion of a urinary tract
infection. Levaquin was given for treatment of her UTI.
Surveillance cultures were drawn daily. Given the fact that she
had a right groin hematoma that performed after the heart
catheterization we questioned whether or not this could be some
type of infectious source. She had the hematoma aspirated , it
was negative for any organisms. She had no other identified
places as far as source of infection. It was believed that she
could potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past.
One of her cultures actually grew out a species of Abiotrophia.
There is only one culture positive , that was taken on February .
She has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time of
this dictation. We appreciate the Infectious Disease Team
following. Their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unless
subsequent cultures began to grow out. Their recommendations
were to continue to follow all cultures and to perform a TEE. A
repeat TEE was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions or
change in bowel function. There were clearly no vegetation seen
on either any transthoracic echos or TEEs. ID made
recommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics , which would
include two weeks of ceftriaxone 1 g IV b.i.d. under the
assumption that this would be completing a course of her therapy
after SBE. They would also recommend sending all valve tissue
for Gram stain and culture as well as pathology. If the Gram
stain and culture were positive , they would suggest extending the
course of the above-mentioned antibiotic therapy.
8. Neurologic: The patient was given Darvon and also codeine as
needed for her pain. She complained of right groin pain
secondary to the hematoma. Her pain is much improved that she is
able to ambulate easily around the Tl Brown Vo on discharge. The
hematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well.
9. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient is
tolerating p.o. well. Her electrolytes were repleted as needed
daily.
10. Psychologic: The patient was seen by social work. It is
clear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also in
going home and returning to her social environment. She
necessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severe
anxiety.
11. Disposition: The patient is stable from a medical
standpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of active
infection. Her white blood cell count is now normal. She is now
awaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have a surgery
scheduled with Dr. Berreth office in the next one to two weeks.

Discharge Date: 6/5/1993
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. DIABETES.
3. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.
4. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Giannone is a 60 year old woman with
adult onset diabetes , hypertension , and
severe peripheral vascular disease status post cerebrovascular
accident in 1986 , who was recently admitted to Rahjo Voychusetts Medical Center between 7/8/23 with what was presumed to be an
exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and new
onset congestive heart failure. PFT&apos;s during that admission showed
FVC of 1.92 , 59% , FEV1 of 1.42 estimated at 55% and FEV1/FVC ratio
94%. An echocardiogram performed during that admission showed
normal left and right ventricular function and size. Since her
discharge , Ms. Gieck has become progressively weak and has noted
gradually increasing shortness of breath on exertion. She denies
fevers and chills , reports a dry cough but no nausea or vomiting.
The cough was nonproductive. She has had poor oral intake , however ,
no change in her bowel habits and no symptoms consistent with an
upper respiratory tract infection. She denies any episodes of chest
pain , however , notes that she requires three pillows to sleep on ,
new onset orthopnea and new onset pedal edema. She presented to the
Si to the emergency department after having
increased shortness of breath the night preceding the 6 of July and was
noted on arrival to the emergency room to have a blood pressure of
200/100 with an oxygen saturation on 100% face mask of 85%.
Portable chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure
and she has been on Lasix , Morphine Sulfate , in addition to
nebulizer treatment. She initially responded well to this
treatment , diuresing 1.4 liters in urine output and her O2
saturation rose to 96% on six liters. At that point , she was
transferred to the floor to the general medical service. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cerebrovascular accident in 1986 ,
diabetes mellitus since 1985 , she has been insulin dependent;
hypertension; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with a long history of smoking. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: Xanax .25 mg q hs p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg po q.o.d. ,
insulin NPH 32 units and 6 units Regular q a.m. , enteric coated
aspirin one tablet q day , Elavil 25 mg q hs , Proventil two puffs q
6 p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for both parents who died of myocardial infarctions , mother
at age 65 and father at age 75 , both parents also had hypertension
and her mother had diabetes. She has several children , all of whom
are in good health. She lives with daughter. She has a sixty pack
year history of smoking but no longer smokes and denies any alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Obese , white female in mild respiratory
distress. Blood pressure 120/60 , heart rate
120 , respiratory rate 16 , temperature 98 with oxygen saturation 94%
on three liters. HEENT exam was notable for normocephalic ,
atraumatic head. Extraocular movements were intact and pupils were
equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Oropharynx
was clear and sclera were also clear and anicteric. Neck exam was
supple. Jugular venous pressure was 10 cm and the carotids were
without bruits. Neck was without adenopathy. Lungs; rales
one-half way up from the bases bilaterally. Cardiac exam showed
that she was tachycardic but with a regular rhythm and S1 and S2
were heard clearly with an S4 , there were no murmurs or rubs noted.
Abdomen; notable for positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly and no other masses felt.
Extremities; 2+ pitting edema bilaterally with 1+ DP and PT pulses
bilaterally without femoral bruits. Rectal exam showed no masses
and was guaiac negative. Neuro exam; alert and oriented x3.
Cranial nerves were bilaterally intact and motor strength was 5 out
of 5 , and sensation was grossly intact as well as her coordination.
Reflexes were symmetric and toes were bilaterally down-going.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: On admission , sodium was 142 , potassium 4.6 ,
chloride 106 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 13 ,
creatinine 0.7 , glucose 220. LFT&apos;s were within normal limits.
Albumin was 3.1 , calcium 9.0 , cholesterol 208 , triglycerides 220.
CBC showed a white count of 16 with hematocrit of 34.3 and
platelets 352 , MCV 91. The differential on her white count
demonstrated 82 polys , 12 lymphocytes , 5 monocytes , 1 eosinophil.
Her first CK was 33 with no MB fraction and an arterial blood gas
/showed pH of 7.41 , 31 , 77 , 23 , and 96%. Chest x-ray was consistent
with congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions and
increased pulmonary vascular redistribution. EKG showed sinus
tachycardia at 120 with normal intervals and axis , with some
flattening in the STT waves in the lateral lead. Urinalysis was
negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was initially admitted to the floor where
she received another dose of IV Lasix and 30 mg
po Nifedipine. Twenty minutes later , patient was noted to be
hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70. She was given a
small IV bolus of 100 cc normal saline with no response to her
systolic blood pressure. She was noted to be nauseated and vomited
x1 with midscapular back pain but no chest pain. She was markedly
diaphoretic , but did not complain of palpitations. Her blood sugar
was 181 and EKG at that time showed further T-wave flattening in
inferior leads. She was started on Dopamine 20 micrograms per
kilograms with initially no response. At that time , she was
transferred to cardiac unit for further management. In the CCU ,
she was weaned from IV Dobutamine and her blood pressures rapidly
came up to systolic blood pressure of 130. Her requirement for
oxygen was weaned from 100% face mask to 3 liters via nasal
cannula , with her O2 saturations remaining 94-95%. She was started
on a beta blocker and her rule out protocol for myocardial
infarction showed flat CK&apos;s , CK&apos;s numbering 33 , 58 , and 147 , with
no MB fractions and no further EKG changes , and no further episodes
of nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. On the third hospital day ,
she was transferred to the cardiology Lan Tempeo service. Soon after
transfer , a routine 12 lead EKG revealed deepening and inversion of
T-waves in the lateral leads , as well as the inferior leads. Her
heart rate at that time was 110 , blood pressure 130/90. She did not
complain of chest pain , shortness of breath , or diaphoresis.
Patient was given one tablet of sublingual Nitroglycerin with no
change in her heart rate and her blood pressure went to 180/60 and
she complained of a headache. She was given 5 mg IV push Lopressor
q 5 minutes x3 with response of her heart rate to 90. EKG post
intervention was without change and she was maintained on 3 liters
oxygen via nasal cannula , without change in her O2 saturation. At
that time , the patient was started on Heparin 5 , 000 units IV bolus
and maintained at 1200 units per hour , and a rule out protocol was
again started. Her CK&apos;s were flat and there were no further EKG
changes. The decision to proceed with cardiac catheterization was
presented to the patient and on the 4th hospital day , the patient
initially refused cardiac catheterization. However , after further
consideration , she agreed to cardiac catheterization on the 7th
hospital day , 6/4/93 .  Because of her history of acute renal
failure with creatinine rising from baseline of 1 to 1.7 on
previous admission with the initiation of Captopril , she had
concurrently an abdominal aortogram to rule out renal artery
stenosis. Her right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 15 with a diffusely diseased left
coronary system , right coronary with serial stenoses of 50%
proximal and 30% distal , and anterior apical hypokinesis with
preserved LV systolic function. An echocardiogram revealed
anteroseptal akinesis at the apex without any mention of thrombus ,
moderately dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction estimated
at 30%. It was felt at this time that the patient had suffered
myocardial infarction at the time between her two Sadam Medical Center admissions. Her catheterization results suggested that
she would be best managed medically and her hospital course then
was notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix and one time dose of
Zaroxolyn , and rate control initially with Diltiazem with moderate
success and then by the 7th hospital day the addition of Lopressor.
Patient diuresed well with loss of 2-3 kilograms and with decrease
in her oxygen requirement was able to be weaned to room air with
oxygen saturations 92-93%. By the time of her discharge , her O2
saturation was 95% on room air and she was able to ambulate without
assistance or complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
ID: On admission , patient&apos;s white blood cell count was noted to be
16 and it was persistently high throughout the first four or
five days of her hospital course. She remained afebrile until the
6th hospital day , when she was noted to have one temperature of
101. Blood culture , urine culture , sputum , and chest x-ray did not
reveal any evidence of infection and patient&apos;s white count was
noted to fall to 9.8. No IV antibiotics were given.
DIABETES; Patient was maintained on her normal dose of insulin
and except for the day when she went to catheterization ,
and covered with CZI sliding scale. Her blood sugars initially ran
in the 200 to 300 range but by the end of admission she was more
well controlled between 100 and 200 , and did not require addition
of CZI sliding scale. Of note , patient had described previous
incidences of feeling diaphoretic and hungry in which she would eat
presumably secondary to hypoglycemia. After starting her beta
blocker , she continued to have these sensations of hypoglycemia and
if so , it was though to be safe to continue with the beta blocker
treatment.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE; Patient has a history of femoral
stenosis and had been suggested that
she have a femoral angioplasty several years previously. Patient
refused that procedure at the time and has had no further
complications. During this admission a renal arteriogram was
performed , which showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis with a
mild non-flow in the stenosis in the right renal artery. Renal
cortex was smooth by arteriography.
DISPOSITION: There were no complications. Patient was able to
ambulate and was stable on discharge. Her congestive
heart failure was largely resolved , and she was discharged to home
with follow-up to be with Dr. Carson Sequin in CARDSPAR MEDICAL CENTER Clinic.
MEDICATIONS: Xanax 0.25 mg po q hs p.r.n.; Digoxin 0.25 mg po q
day; Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.; enteric coated
aspirin one tablet po q day; Lasix 60 mg po q day; insulin 32 units
NPH in the morning along with six units Regular insulin in the
morning; Elavil 25 mg po q hs. She is to continue with her
diabetic diet with 2100 calories and to have low salt , low
cholesterol diet.

Discharge Date: 7/20/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: HYPERLIPIDEMIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Legions is a 54 year old professor
at A No Sa , status
post coronary artery bypass graft ( 5 vessel bypass ) 8 years ago who
presents with recurrent substernal chest pain times one day. The
patient was transferred from Phlukester Hospital after developing the
acute onset of substernal chest pain while driving his automobile.
The patient was under no extraordinary circumstances ( e.g.
emotional stress , exertional stress ) at the time he developed chest
pain. Since the time of his five vessel CABG in 1987 , the patient
had experienced no intercurrent angina.
The patient&apos;s coronary risk factors include a positive family
history and a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. However the
patient does not have hypertension , diabetes and he is not a
tobacco smoker.
As mentioned , the patient&apos;s chest pain was substernal and radiated
to the upper epigastrium. He experienced an element of burning
with exertion. Prior to this episode of recurrent chest pain , the
patient had had multiple exercise tolerance tests which were read
as normal. He graded the chest pain at 8/10.
The patient presented to G urgent care where his pain was not
relieved with four sublingual nitroglycerin. An EKG demonstrated
lateral ST wave depressions. The patient was transferred to
Skaggssin Hospital where IV TNG , morphine and Nifedipine were given.
The patient&apos;s pain decreased to a level of 4/10. Despite these
maneuvers , the patient&apos;s pain continued through the night and in
the morning. In the morning , he received additional morphine and
IV Heparin was begun. Subsequently the patient became pain-free.
The patient was transferred to Ck Health Of for
further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hyperlipidemia. Bilateral anterior and
lateral thigh achiness with exertion
times six months ( workup in progress ).
MEDICATIONS: On presentation to Menjack Hospital Medical Center ,
Lovastatin 40 mg q q.m. , 20 mg q p.m. and
enteric-coated aspirin one tablet q day.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM A,XO COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IV nitroglycerin , IV heparin , Nifedipine SL , morphine as
well as aspirin and Lovastatin.
The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s father developed angina secondary
to coronary artery disease at age 54 and died
at age 75 from an MI.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with
his wife. He works as a professor at
Rieglemoinesro A Shing and restores buildings in his free time.
HABITS: The patient denies tobacco use. He is an
occasional alcohol drinker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , Mr. Latimer is
a pleasant middle-aged man , mildly
anxious but in no acute distress. Vital signs on transfer:
temperature 98.6 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 110/78 , respiratory
rate 22 with oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters of oxygen.
HEENT: unremarkable. Neck: no jugular venous distention ( JVP
less than 6 cm ) , carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits or
delayed upstroke. Lungs: clear with good breath sounds
bilaterally. Coronary: regular rate and rhythm with good heart
sounds and a clear Sl and S2. There were no rubs , murmurs or
gallops appreciated. There was no S3 or S4. The point of maximum
impulse was not displaced. The patient&apos;s spine was not tender and
there was no evidence of costovertebral angle tenderness. Abdomen
had good bowel sounds and was soft and nontender to palpation. No
masses were palpated. Groin demonstrated decreased femoral pulses
bilaterally with a faint left femoral bruit. Rectal: normal
rectal tone with an anodular prostate. Stool was soft , brown and
guaiac negative. Extremities demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. The patient&apos;s pulses at the dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis were 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Electrolytes on presentation were within normal limits. His LFTs
were notable for a slight increase in his LDH to 252. The
patient&apos;s first CK on presentation was 2300 with a quantitative MB
of 10.2 ng/ml. Cholesterol was 79. Albumin 2.8. Protime 12.4 ,
INR 1.1. PTT 40.7 , consistent with heparin therapy. CBC was
notable for a normal white count , hematocrit and platelet count.
Urine had a specific gravity of 1.021 , pH 5 , negative dipstick
evaluation.
Chest x-ray demonstrated clear lung parenchyma and no bony
abnormalities. EKG on admission to Raldmance Mountbay
showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 73 with normal intervals
and an axis of 0. The patient had Q waves in leads 3 and F and
biphasic T waves in leads V4 through V6. There was minimal change
in these abnormalities with resolution of the patient&apos;s pain. Of
note , EKGs taken at Townileahli Medical Center during the patient&apos;s initial
admission were notable for T wave depressions in leads V4 through
V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit on IV heparin and
nitroglycerine as well as continuation of his aspirin and
Lovastatin. The patient&apos;s pain was treated with morphine sulfate.
His CKs were followed serially every 8 hours and achieved a peak CK
of 2790 on 6/16/95 at 12 a.m. with an MB fraction of 188.8 ng/ml.
Thereafter the patient&apos;s CKs rapidly declined. On 3/30/94 , the
patient&apos;s CK was 317 with an MB fraction of 3.5 ng/ml.
After 24 hours pain-free in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , the
patient was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down floor. His IV
nitroglycerin and IV heparin were discontinued and the patient
remained pain-free. Echocardiogram performed on 6/16/95
demonstrated inferior and posterior hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of approximately 46%.
On 3/9/95 , the patient underwent exercise tolerance testing with a
submax modified Bruce protocol. The patient exercised 9 minutes
and was able to complete the study without dyspnea on exertion or
chest pain. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 108 and a
maximum blood pressure of 160/80. EKG was notable for unifocal
PVCs and up to 2 mm ST depression in leads V2 through V4 which
persisted up to 15 minutes into recovery. The patient was given
one sublingual nitroglycerin and these EKG changes resolved.
The exercise tolerance test was interpreted as strongly positive
for ischemic coronary artery disease.
On 1/9/95 , the patient underwent a submax MIBI to assess coronary
perfusion of the heart. Similarly , the exercise component of this
examination demonstrated EKG changes consistent with ischemic
coronary flow. Nuclear imaging demonstrated a fixed apical lateral
defect in the patient&apos;s heart consistent with a healed or healing
transmural infarct. There was no evidence of ischemic reperfusion
defects.
The results of these tests were discussed with the patient and his
wife in conjunction with the treating medical team of Dr. Settecase .
The patient was offered the opportunity for coronary
catheterization to evaluate his anatomy , but he declined at the
present time. It was decided that the patient would be maximally
medically managed and discharged to home with close followup under
Dr. Cockburn and Dr. Stenkamp . The patient&apos;s cardiac medications were
appropriately adjusted while an inpatient to achieve maximum
cardiac benefit.
On presentation , the patient also complained of progressive
anterior and lateral thigh pain. This pain was brought on by
exertion and had increasingly limited his ability to walk over the
last six months whereas he had been able to walk four to five miles
a day in recent months. He had been able to walk only
approximately one-quarter mile before developing pain in his
anterior thighs as well whereas he had been able to climb several
flights of stairs a few months ago. He now was able to walk only
half a flight to a flight of stairs at a time before having to
rest. Six months ago , the patient had achieved a 25 pound weight
loss but , by his report , because of his inability to exercise
effectively , he had regained 15 pounds. The patient did not
experience this same anterior thigh pain while riding a bicycle or
swimming. As an inpatient , Mr. Woollen underwent a non-invasive
vascular study of the femoral and popliteal arteries. These
demonstrated no significant arterial occlusions as assessed by
pressure manometry. The possibility of myositis or neuromuscular
compromise was entertained and these are to be followed up as an
outpatient.
The patient also complained of symptoms consistent with an upper
respiratory viral infection which he had been experiencing over the
past two weeks. While an inpatient , he had a number of febrile
episodes , achieving a maximum temperature of 101.4. The patient
was treated symptomatically with Tylenol and started on Biaxin 500
mg po bid. He received a five day course of oral Biaxin with
resolution of his fever and decrease in his symptomatology.
The patient never complained of shortness of breath , palpitations ,
diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting or recurrent chest pain as an
inpatient. However physical examination demonstrated rales 4 to 5
cm above the bases bilaterally. The extremities remained free of
edema and the patient&apos;s jugular venous pressure never exceeded 6
cm. A chest x-ray on 5/7/95 demonstrated evidence of early
congestive heart failure. The patient was treated with daily doses
of IV Lasix with resolution of his rales. By the time of
discharge , there was no evidence of continued heart failure and the
patient&apos;s Lasix was discontinued.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po q day
2. Cholestyramine one packet po q hs
3. Lovastatin 20 mg po q hs
4. Lopressor 50 mg po tid
5. Sublingual nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets to be taken prn
with chest pain
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to home with
followup in MERH under Drs. Dwayne Ariel Bremme .
The patient was instructed to call CMH Urgent Care if his chest
pain recurs and does not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.

ATTENDING: MOLLEKER , LOWELL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Confusion , mental status change , and hypercarbic respiratory
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with history of asthma/COPD ,
morbid obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , but does not tolerate
BiPAP who presented to the emergency room with worsening
somnolence. Apparently over the past week the patient has become
progressively more confused and lethargic. At baseline , she is
alert and oriented and walks intermittently with walker ,
although , at most time she is bedbound because of her obesity and
an injured knee at the end of October .  Over the previous week
apparently , the patient had difficulty with her home oxygen
machine and she felt like she &quot;was not getting any air&quot;.
Apparently , her son had called the company that supplies the
oxygen. They had come in and said that he should figure out how
to fix it according to him , as she had not been getting oxygen
for the week prior to admission. She had not had any increase in
cough or sputum production. No fever or chills. No chest pain.
No nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. She also had not any change in
her baseline lower extremity swelling/deformity and no increased
erythema or pain in her lower extremities. She has not had any
recent long trips , although she had been somewhat bed bound after
this knee injury. On the day of admission , the patient had
increasing shortness of breath , fatigue , and somnolence and
apparently hallucinations. The Emergency Medical Service was
called and she was unarousable at home and they found her oxygen
sats to be 40%. By the time she in to the ER she was lethargic
and moaning incoherently. Her vitals at that time were
temperature of 97.6 Fahrenheit , blood pressure of 178/46 mmHg ,
heart rate of 106 and regular , breathing 36 times a minute and
satting 90% on 100% nonrebreather. Her fingerstick at that time
was 220. Her trachea was intubated and she was given Fentanyl ,
Valium , albuterol , and Atrovent nebs and Solu-Medrol in the
emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , severe left ventricular
hypertrophy , asthma/COPD without known pulmonary function testing
in the past , morbid obesity weighing approximately 460 pounds ,
obstructive sleep apnea - she could not tolerate CPAP in the
past , osteoarthritis , and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as a
distant history of pulmonary embolus. After having a total
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in
4/3 , she was anticoagulated for several months , but not since
then.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day , furosemide 40 mg by mouth
each day , glyburide 5 mg by mouth each day , albuterol inhalers ,
Motrin 600 mg by mouth each day , and metoprolol 25 mg by mouth 3
times a day , and she is also on 3L nasal cannula home oxygen 24
hours a day.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is a former bus driver. She lives at home with her son ,
Troisi who is 30 years old , has a visiting nurse. No tobacco or
alcohol or illicit drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Her temperature was 97.6 degree Fahrenheit , her heart rate was
106 and regular , her blood pressure was 130/50 , respiratory rate
of 24 , and oxygen saturation 98%. At that point , she was
intubated. She opened her eyes to sternal rub but not to voice.
Her pupils were equal and 2 mm bilaterally. Her neck was supple.
Pulmonary: Sounds were coarse anterior and laterally.
Cardiovascular: She had distant , distant heart sounds ,
tachycardic. Her jugular venous pressure was unable to be
assessed given her neck size and her distal , radial , and dorsalis
pedis pulses were all palpable 1+. Abdomen is obese. Bowel
sounds were present , soft , nontender , and nondistended. She had
a midline scar. Extremities were cool with chronic venostasis
changes perhaps lymphedema changes bilaterally. Left lower
extremity was 23 inches and right lower extremity was 18 inches
at the calf. Neurologic: As stated , she opens her eyes to
sternal rub at that time.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
She had a sodium of 144 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 95 , bicarbonate
of 40 , BUN of 16 , creatinine of 0.7 , and glucose of 236. Calcium
of 8.9 , magnesium of 1.9 , phosphorous of 4.7 , ALT of 23 , AST of
18 , total bilirubin of 2.1 , alkaline phosphatase of 78 , and
albumin of 3.9. Urinalysis was significant for 3+ protein , 2+
blood , positive leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , and
bacteria as well as trichomonas. Her D-dimer was 1330. Her
white count was 13 , 000 with 90% neutrophils , 2% bands , and 5%
lymphocytes. Her hematocrit was 42.4% and platelet count was
164 , 000. Her MCV was 93 and she had an anti-PF4 antibody , also
known as a HIT antibody , which was negative. Her INR was 1.2 and
her PTT was 26.3. Her urine and serum tox screens did not reveal
any toxins. Her chest radiograph was a poor quality film given
the girth. The film was rotated. The ET tube was 3.5 cm from
the corner , otherwise , extraordinarily limited , but no gross
consolidation or effusions were noted. A pulmonary embolus CT
scan or V/Q scan were considered to rule out a pulmonary embolus;
however , the patient&apos;s abdominal girth prevented either of these
studies from being done. Lower extremity noninvasive studies
were performed , which did not show any clot although this was
also limited by her chronic lower extremity changes. Urine
culture and blood cultures were sent on 10/28/06 .  The urine
culture grew mixed flora and the blood cultures have been
negative to date.
ASSESSMENT AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
This is a 54-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease on home oxygen as well as obstructive sleep apnea ,
hypertension , and left ventricular hypertrophy and obesity with
mental status changes and respiratory changes consistent with an
exacerbation of recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease and
hypoxemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary: Her trachea was extubated within several hours of
coming to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. At first , she was
doing quite well on BiPAP at 25 and 5; however , she became a bit
more somnolent and the decision was made to intubate her trachea
once again within several hours. An ABG at that time was done ,
which revealed an arterial blood gas at that time with an FiO2 of
60% revealed a pH of 7.19 , a CO2 of 119 , and an oxygen of 106
with saturation of 97%. As we were preparing to intubate the
trachea , the patient became more alert and requested to speak to
her son beforehand and saying she did not want to have the tube
down her throat. Her son came in and she continued making more
sense and asking us not to intubate her trachea. The decision
was made to observe her with the BiPAP , which was done. Within
several hours her carbon dioxide had decreased to 103 and then by
3 hours after that it actually decreased to 80. Her arterial
blood gas at that time showed pH of 7.32 with a PCO2 of 80 , a PO2
of 71 on 2L of actual nasal cannula and then O2 saturation of
95%. She remained on BiPAP intermittently at various setting.
Her final settings were pressure support of 20 and a PEEP of 5.
Her CO2 ranged from the mid 60s to 99 without a very clear
correlation between her mental status and her CO2s. The thought
was that her baseline CO2 was probably somewhere in the 70s given
that her pH was normal with PCO2 around in the low 80s. It was
thought that she is a chronic carbon dioxide retainer. Her
bicarbonates on admission here previously had been in the mid to
high 30s and low 40s just as they were during this admission and
that she just had an acute hypercarbic event. Throughout her
stay she has had episodes where she become slightly less
responsive always will awake with appropriate physical stimuli
and will give appropriate responses. She was treated for her
pulmonary disease initially with corticosteroids , which were
discontinued given that we did not feel that she had large a
inflammatory component to this , Levofloxacin 500 mg a day ,
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and she was started on an
inhaled corticosteroid.
2. Vascular: The possibility of a pulmonary embolus was
considered especially given her history of pulmonary embolus in
the past. Unfortunately , diagnostic imaging was inadequate given
her girth and lower extremity issues. There is discussion of
putting her on chronic anticoagulation for the possibility of
pulmonary embolus; however , we felt she had a low to moderate
probability of pulmonary embolus and that the risks of long-term
anticoagulation outweigh the benefits given that she probably did
not have a pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis. This was
discussed with the patient and she agreed with that decision.
This can be readdressed in the future. The decision was also
centered around the fact that her previous pulmonary embolus was
in the setting of pelvic surgery and likely did not reflex any
increased likelihood of thrombosis. However , she should be
continued on subcutaneous enoxaparin or other prophylaxis for
deep venous thrombosis while she is bedbound.
3. Cardiac: The patient has a history of hypertension and left
ventricular hypertrophy. She should be continued on
enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day , lisinopril 40 mg a day , and
she will discharged on atenolol 25 mg per day.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was
managed in the hospital on a low dose of insulin NPH and Aspart
sliding scale. On discharge , she will be resumed on her home
dose of sulfonylurea. It may be considered that she will be good
candidate for metformin given her weight and likely poor control
of her diabetes.
5. Obstructive sleep apnea with known elevated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure at approximately 90+ right atrium and
echocardiogram during her last admission at Mertaymonpeters Medical Center .  The patient should be counseled and encouraged to use
her BiPAP or CPAP machine at home all the time at night given her
likely severe obstructive sleep apnea and known vascular effects
of that.
MEDICATION ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day.
2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth each day.
3. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg by mouth each day.
4. Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous each day.
5. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers every 4 hours and p.r.n.
wheezing or shortness of breath , this may be changed to inhalers
when the patient can tolerate and she should be educated on that.
6. Flovent.
7. Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth each day for 5 more days.
8. Flagyl 500 mg by mouth twice a day for 11 more days for
treatment of trichomonas.
9. Glyburide 5 mg by mouth once daily.
10. Regular insulin sliding scale as determined by the doctor at
rehabilitation with meals.
11. BiPAP 20 for pressure support and 5 of PEEP every night all ,
night and during the day as required. It would be recommended
that she was on BiPAP continuously for at least 48 hours after
discharge as tolerated by the patient except to speak with her
family.

Discharge Date: 7/9/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old woman
with coronary artery disease and
cardiomyopathy admitted with clinical shortness of breath. The
patient has a long history of coronary artery disease with most
recent echocardiogram in 8/06 showing dilated left ventricle ,
ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , inferior posterior thinning and
akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal septum to apex.
There was remaining wall of hypokinesis. There was also trace
aortic insufficiency and hypertrophied right ventricle. The most
recent catheterization was 11/4/99 showing a left main with 30%
distal stenosis , occluded left anterior descending , right coronary
artery with 40% proximal and mid 70% stenoses. The grafts were
without significant disease. The left heart catheterization showed
left ventricle pressures of 220/80. Left ventriculography revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% to 55% with trace mitral regurgitation.
( Please refer to past medical history for further details of the
patient&apos;s cardiac history ). The patient now reports malaise for
one week with increasing dyspnea on exertion. She also reports
fever to 101 two days ago with cough productive of white sputum.
She reports that she went to Urgent Care and received Bactrim. She
also had received Bactrim 48 hours ago. She also complains of
increased orthopnea , baseline two-pillow orthopnea and now
five-pillow orthopnea and nighttime cough. She denies dietary
indiscretion or medical noncompliance and reports that her
peripheral edema is stable. She denies dysuria or frequency and
also believes that her weight has increased although notes on chart
indicate that her baseline is 220 to 228 pounds.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiac risk
factors were age and hypertension. Diabetes
mellitus , nonproliferative anemia , one non-Q wave myocardial
infarction in 1981 , coronary artery bypass grafting in 1995 at
Barreman A Health with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending graft , saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery graft , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
graft. Several admissions for congestive heart failure including
one in 1996 which included an echocardiogram with ejection fraction
of 40%. Decreased from earlier 59% with inferior posterior
hypokinesis. Congestive heart failure admission in 2/11 with an
echocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 30% to 35% ,
decreased from previous echocardiogram. Non-Q wave myocardial
infarction in 8/06 at I Imin Medical Center with troponin of
6. Baseline left bundle branch block. Insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus. Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
Hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , status post appendectomy ,
status post right mastoidectomy ( secondary to recurrent otitis ).
History of recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Amaurosis fugax
in left eye. The patient was treated with Coumadin after 2/14
admission. Head CT showed no sign of infarct. Echocardiogram was
negative for PFO. Ejection fraction at the time was 60%.
Loculated pleural effusion in 4/9 with apparent decortication and
lysis. Nephrolithiasis but none times greater than two years.
Bell&apos;s palsy resolved.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives. Ceclor causes a rash.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , EC-ASA 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Cozaar 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zestril 20

Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 50 q.a.m. , 8 q.p.m. subcutaneously ,
Slow-K eight once a day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Retired housewife , married , rare alcohol use , no
tobacco use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother with myocardial infarction at
age 40 and a father with myocardial infarction at
age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.1 , pulse 59 ,
blood pressure 180/82 , respirations 22 , and
96% on room air. Weight 226 pounds. General: Large woman lying
in bed in no acute distress. HEENT: Jugulovenous pressure greater
than 12 cm , oropharynx clear , no thyromegaly. Chest: Bibasilar
crackles and diffuse wheezes and rhonchi , no E to A changes.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. There was a II/VI
systolic murmur loudest at bases , question S4 , S1 and S2. Abdomen:
Soft , protuberant , nontender , benign. Extremities: Bilateral
edema to knees , minimally pitting. Neurologic: Cranial nerves and
strength intact.
LABORATORY/X-RAY STUDIES: Notable for BUN of 55 ( baseline high 20s
in 8/06 ) , creatinine of 1.7 , baseline
of 1.0 to 1.2. Hematocrit of 35.5 with MCV of 80.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with presumptive
diagnosis of recent tracheal bronchitis
complicated by overlying congestive heart failure. She was treated
with doxycycline and never spiked a fever in-house. Her cough was
essentially nonproductive and thus sputum was not sent. She was
diuresed progressively and responded well symptomatically to this
diuresis. Her pulmonary examination improved. The patient&apos;s
examination was complicated by some asymptomatic bradycardia into
the 40s , particularly at night while lying down. On admission , her
Digoxin level was low at 0.5. An attempt to increase her beta
blocker appeared to exacerbate this bradycardia and thus she was
discharged on the same dose that she was admitted with , i.e. ,
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. Notably , even when these medications
were held , her pulse was often in the high 40s or low 50s without
symptoms and remained less than 60 even while walking some of the
time. Her thyroid stimulating hormone was measured and was normal
at 3.13. The patient&apos;s elevated BUN and creatinine were thought
secondary to her congestive heart failure and in fact , her
creatinine decreased with diuresis. Recent iron studies in 2/30
were suggestive of anemia of chronic disease and her hematocrit of
35 on review was towards the low end of normal range during the
past year.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. Discharge medications were EC-ASA 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
q.d. , doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days , NPH insulin 8
units q.a.m. , start 50 units q.a.m. and 8 units q.p.m. , Zestril 20
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. ,
Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , Demadex 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She
will follow up with Dr. Estrade in one week in his clinic.
V.N.A. will check the patient&apos;s weight , pulse and blood pressure at
home. They will also check the patient&apos;s potassium and creatinine
and call in abnormal results to Dr. Tribley .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
47 y/o female c h/o HTN , depression , substance abuse , presented to ED
on 2/2/01 c complaints of rapid heart beat , palpitations , and chest
heaviness/pain radiating to left arm. Symptoms progressed to left-sided
weakness/ heaviness and sensory loss. In ED , pt. found to be in afib c
RVR , rate controlled c Diltiazem IV. CT/CTA showed question of a clot
in M2 vessel , therefore Heparinized and transferred to Or Van Sa for acute
stroke care. TTE showed LVH , mild LAE , no thrombus. EKG&apos;s c afib , LVH ,
ST/T wave changes c/w strain pattern. CPK&apos;s , troponin flat. MRI
showed very small white matter changes in right hemisphere not felt to
be clinically significant ( no evidence for acute stroke ). Neurologic
defecitcharacterized by left hemiparesis and hemianopsia in ED ,
over time evolved into left eye blurriness/decreased vision , left
facial numbness ( no droop ) , right arm and leg numbness and weakness.
Above exam felt to be inconsistent with single lesion , opinion of psych
and neurology was that the above symptoms represented psychogenic
augmentation of an initial real neuro defecit from TIA/small embolic
stroke which recanalized. Transferred to floor on 9/21/01 in afib c
rate in 90&apos;s on Digoxin and Lopressor. Started on Coumadin that night ,
Heparin continued at therapeutic range until initiation of Lovenox on
hosp. day # 6. Spontaneously converted to NSR on Lopressor 100 mg PO
tid on 3/18/01 , Lopressor decreased to 50 po tid secondary to sinus
bradycardia , then converted to Atenolol 25 mg PO qd for once
daily dosing. Neurologic deficit spontaneously resolved overnight on
3/18/01 .  On exam , only subtle weakness detected on left arm and finger
extention , numbness completely resolved. Patient will be discharged to
home in stable condition with instructions to follow up with PCP in 1-2
weeks and with Dr. Lapine in 4-6 weeks. Coumadin titration will be
carried out by INMC Fort A Sas office. VNA sercices will carry out
Lovenox administration/education. Plan is for 4-6 weeks of therapeutic
anticoagulation on Coumadin , then reassess need if still in NSR.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should call Dr. Sphon office tomorrow morning for an appt. this
week. You will have VNA come to your home this evening for Lovenox shot
administration/education. You should take Coumadin as well for the next
month as directed by your doctor. You will need to have blood drawn
through the PH Sey Ni Mont office for INR levels starting tomorrow.
Call your doctor or return to the ED if you have chest pain ,
palpitations , lightheadedness , weakness , or other worrisome symptoms.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 64-year-old with known CAD , atherosclerotic peripheral
vascular disease , and type 2 diabetes presented with back pain. She
describes a sudden onset of 8/10 stabbing back pain 4 days ago without
a clear precipitant. The pain was non raditating and partially releived
with analgesics.She denied any bowel or bladder incontinence or saddle
anesthes ia. She denied any fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , or
diarrhea. She does however complain of some urinary frequency ( on
lasix ) in the last few days with out any dysuria or urgency. Of note
over the past month she has had increasing had shortness of breath
however she denies any orthopnea or PND. The patient has long standing
pedal edema and has increasing abdominal distension over the last month
but has not noticed any change in her weight. The patient has CAD and
her angina equivalent is jaw pain.However in the last 6 months she has
had intermittent left sided chest pain that radiates to her left arm.
In the ED the patient was ruled out for an aortic dissection , MI and
had a negative D-Dimer. However lipase levels have been elevated with
norm al LFTs. She was admitted with a diagnosis of pancreatitis.
Hospital course:
1.GI- S/P cholecystectomy. Her lipase was mildly elevated on
admission to 200 , fell to 60 with NPO and IVF. However , MRA read with
radiology 4/4 shows diffuse atherosclerotic disease including

003049719 | CHO | 79975460 | | 376642 | 1/12/1994 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/12/1994 Report Status: Signed

Discharge Date: 6/25/1994
PRINCIPAL COMPLAINT: SPINAL STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year-old female
who complained of lower back pain and
bilateral leg pain. She noted that in , October of 1993 , she had
the onset of some low back pain , and in October of 1993 , it went
down into her lower extremities. The pain is currently in the
lower back and bilateral buttocks , to the bilateral knees , and all
aspects of her legs below the knee. She reports diminished
sensation of the anterior aspect of her leg on the right side , but
this has only occurred once on the left side. She has no motor
complaints and denies any bowel or bladder dysfunction. Her pain
is specifically made worse with walking. She cannot walk even as
far as a block before she has to stop and sit. She also
demonstrates transition pain when she gets up , in and out of a bed
or chair. She has diabetes , and has been on insulin for eight
years. In the past , for her back , her treatment has consisted of
Motrin , and three epidural steroid injections. Two were done in
October .  The second obtained approximately 80% relief for three
months. The last one was of no help whatsoever. Her x-rays on
review shows that she has degenerative spondylolisthesis at L4-L5.
Her CT scan and MRI scan both demonstrate the presence of a slip at
L4-L5. There is rather marked L4 neural foraminal narrowing
bilaterally , with only some narrowing of the lateral recesses of
the canal. The distribution of her pain sounds most likely to be
of L4 nerve root.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus with retinopathy , atypical anxiety
disorder , aortic stenosis with history of rheumatic fever , and
glaucoma in the left eye , and congenital nystagmus , and amblyopia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left knee arthrotomy; right ankle open
reduction , internal fixation; right carpal
tunnel , and cervical laminectomy.
ALLERGIES: Elavil , Zomax and Naprosyn.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin , NPH , 8 units subcu q. day; Prozac 10 mg
p.o. q. day , and Timolol .5% , one GTT O.S. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is slightly obese , and stands
with a normal alignment. She can reach her
hands down to her ankles. Extension is about 20 degrees , and
causes bilateral posterior SI and leg pain. Reflexes are all 3+ in
the lower extremities. The toes are upgoing and in clonus
bilaterally. This spasticity has been noted in the past by Dr.
Ferandez , JQCH neurologist , who followed her for quite a long time
for this problem. Romberg exam is negative. Pulses are 1+
dorsalis pedis , and trace in the posterior tibial bilaterally.
Detailed sensory/motor exam of the lower extremities reveals no
deficit , but she does have significant spasticity. Indeed , it is
actually difficult to test her EHL and anterior tibial with her
knees extended , as she has marked plantar flexion and tone in that
region with the knees flexed. The patient is able to demonstrate
good EHL and anterior tib function. Straight leg was negative
bilaterally. Hip range of motion is normal and pain free.
Patrick&apos;s test was negative. Femoral stress test was negative. Of
note , the patient had an old medial left knee scar surgery. The
patient was afebrile. Vital signs stable. HEENT was within normal
limits. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Heart was regular rate
and rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur , and no radiation to the
carotid. Abdomen was soft , non-distended , non-tender. No
splenomegaly was noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent posterior decompression
with L4-L5 and pedicle screw fixation with iliac
crest bone graft , as well as a discectomy at L4-L5 , and complete
foraminotomies of L4 root bilaterally. The patient received
approximately 6 liters of lactated Ringer&apos;s , one liter of Hespan ,
500 cc of albumin , 3 units of packed red blood cells , 2 units of
cell saver. Estimated blood loss was 2000 cc. The patient did
well postoperatively , with her physical therapy , and mobilizing
well. Of note , the patient did spike a fever to 102.2; however ,
her workup was only significant for atelectasis on her chest x-ray ,
and trace leukocytes in her urine , with cultures being negative.
Of note , the temperature was associated with dysuria. Thus , the
patient was started on Bactrim , one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days. The
patient did well in physical therapy , and was discharged on
postoperative day five. The patient is discharged to home with
Caa St,hos Hospital .
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with full Xasden Community Hospital .
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Deener at OPBH .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Niferex 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Bactrim DS ,
one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Timoptic .5 , one drop O.S. b.i.d. , NPH 8 units

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms Galabeas is a 71F with DM , CAD , s/p 3vCABG , s/p RCA stent in 10/22 ,
CHF( EF=45% in 10/22 ) , h/o bradycardia now with AICD/Pacer , s/p R-CEA ,
s/p ? TIA , who presents with dizziness , ataxia x 24H.
Pt denies CP , SOB , palpitations. Pt denies melana; BRBPR. NO new meds ,
no N/V/F/C. This is unlike anything she has had in the past.
In the ED , labs were all within normal limits. While on a monitor she
had an episode of bradycardia to the 40s. Dr. Hilmer of
the EP service interogated the device and indicated that it was
working properly with no arrhythmias. Telemetry in the ED also did
not record the bradycardic episode , suggesting that perhaps it was an
artifact. Pt&apos;s toxicology screen was negative. Her vitals in the ED w
ere 98.0 , 55 , 176/60 , 18 , 98%RA. No dysmetria; no dysdiadocokinesia;
negativ e Romberg&apos;s sign.
Hospital Course:
1. CV: pt ruled out for MI; 24H telemetry showed no arrhythmias.
Pt&apos;s BB was held while in house because of worry about
bradyarrhythmia , hypotension. Continued antihypertensive and CAD
treatment with with Cozaar , Lasix , Norvasc , Isosorbide , Digoxin ,
Amiodarone. Pt is also on Coumadin , Plavix , and ASA , which was
continued in house. Pt was discussed w/ pt&apos;s cardiologist , Dr.
Kallio who indicated this was not a new complaint in the patient and
also that she has been non-compliant in the past. PT was on Coreg but
this was held prior to admit for low BP&apos;s. Pt was hypertensive w/ SB
P 150&apos;s while inpt but we will d/c pt off Coreg and defer to Dr.
Doniel for reinstitution of beta blockade
2. NEURO: pt&apos;s neuro exam was normal with no focal signs , and no signs
of cerebellar dysfunction. Nevertheless given her significant vascular
risk factors there was concern for vertebral-basilar insufficiency.
MRI/MRA was not possible given pt&apos;s AICD/pacer. Upon discussion w/
team CT/CTA were deferred given pt&apos;s renal insufficiency and risk of
contrast nephropathy coupled with our feeling that any findings would
not change pt management. This will be discussed with pt&apos;s PCP , Dr.
Benedict Wichern .
3. ENDO: pt was continued on home insulin regimen with coverage with
insulin sliding scale. Pt was found have a TSH of 158 FT4 1.8 , FT3 56.
Upon discussion w/ pt , she revealed that she had previously been
diagnosed and begun on replacement but did not know what it was for and
subsequently stopped it on her own. Pt started on synthroid to be f/u
w/endocrine. This may be the etiology of her symptoms.
4. Prophylaxis: Nexium; pt was already anticoagulated with ASA , plavix
and Coumadin.
5. Disp: Pt to follow-up w/ Dr. Kishaba for managment of CHF/BP , and
with Dr. Blagg for f/u of potential neurovascular etiology of symptoms.
Pt to f/u with endocrinology for managment of hypothyroidism.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. f/u endo for management
2. f/u w/ Dr. Schryer for possible reinstitution of beta blockade and
CHF/BP management
3. f/u Dr. Hackborn for w/u potential vertebral-basilar insufficieny with

FAMILY HISTORY:
Remarkable for diabetes mellitus.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives with three children. Has a history of tobacco one pack
per day for 20 years , occasional alcohol and prior history of
cocaine. Her healthcare proxy is Laverne Baxley , phone number
413-588-1750 or cell phone 340-975-4632 and her code status is a
full code.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Her physical exam on admission notable for a temperature of 96.9 ,
heart rate 109 , blood pressure 136/92 , respiratory rate of 16 ,
sating 95% on room air. Physical exam was notable for difficulty
with following commands. Heart was regular rate and rhythm. No
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Lungs with poor respiratory effort.
No wheezes or crackles appreciated. Abdomen was soft , nontender ,
nondistended , no hepatomegaly. She had no lower extremity edema
and on neuro exam , required frequent refocusing to main
attention; however , was able to count backwards from 10. She did
not initiate any spontaneous speech except when distressed or in
pain.
LABS:
On admission notable for a white count of 0.67 , hematocrit 19.6
and platelets of 11 , 000. Her differential had 53% polys , 30%
bands. BUN of 14 , creatinine of 2.2 , glucose of 288. Her ALT
was 64 , AST 71 , alk phos 107 , total bili 0.7 , and her UA revealed
LE positive , 6-10 white blood cells , 2-5 red blood cells and 4+
bacteria. Urine cultures were sent at that time.
ASSESSMENT:
A 41-year-old female , long standing aplastic anemia transfusion
dependent , history of avascular necrosis , history of multiple
infections , who came in with decreased mental status as well as
leg pain. Subsequently found to have urosepsis as well as a
Klebsiella bacteremia with course complicated by development of a
cholecystitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. ID: Blood cultures grew Klebsiella as well as urine culture
grew Klebsiella , determined to be a urosepsis During her hospital
course. Was hypotensive requiring transport to the MICU as well
as pressors. She was initially treated with ceftazidine that had
been ??_____?? levofloxacin when her cultures came back
sensitive. Also hospital course complicated by development of
cholecystitis. She was started on amp as well as Flagyl to cover
for her cholecystitis in addition to the Levaquin. She was to
complete a 10-day course of amp , levo , Flagyl after her last
positive culture , which would take her up until 9/12 to
discontinue the antibiotics. Prior to discharge additional blood
culture was collected to ensure that she had cleared her
bacteremia prior to replacing the Hickman line. This blood
culture should be followed up before the Hickman line is placed.
2. Neuro. Patient had decreased mental status as well as pain
on admission. Baseline , she does have chronic pain and is high
dose of oxycodone as well as methadone at home. However , on
admission , she had acute full body pain. This pain improved as
her infection was treated and returned to her baseline level.
Her mental status , which according to her daughter , she is
frequently somnolent , was decreased from baseline. However , as
her sepsis resolved , her somnolence improved.
3. Pulmonary. During hospital course had one episode of dry
cough with scant hemoptysis in the setting of low platelets. Her
cough did not persist and her oxygen saturation at the time of
discharge was 95% on room air.
4. Cardiovascularwise from a pump perspective , her EF was 35%
with global hypokinesis , trace AI. Initially she was fluid
overloaded following resuscitation; however , autodiuresed. She
was restarted on hydrochlorothiazide for her hypertension.
Rythmwise , initially she had sinus tachycardia in the setting of
her sepsis. Then on 3/28 , developed atrial flutter with rates
up to 150s. She was given IV Lopressor , when she converted back
to sinus rhythm. She was then continued on p.o. metoprolol for
rate control. She was not anticoagulated due to her low
platelets and bleeding risk.
5. Vascular: It was noted that she did have swollen lower
extremity that was tender , right greater than left , after
transfer out from the MICU. Pulses were intact. She was able to
move her feet. ??_____?? were performed and did not show any
evidence of DVT. Her swelling continued to decrease as she
diuresed.
6. GI: During her MICU stay , she developed right upper quadrant
pain and ultrasound suggestive of cholecystitis. Surgery was
consulted; however , due to her high surgical risk , it was decided
that she would be managed medically. Her bilirubin continued to
trend down. She continued to tolerate p.o. liquids and food and
did not complain of a new right upper quadrant pain. Given her
chronic esophagitis , as well as epigastric discomfort , she was
kept on a PPI. In addition , she may also continue Carafate as
needed. She also has a history of hepatitis C , which she is to
follow with Liver Clinic following discharge.
7. Heme: She has a history of aplastic anemia of unknown
etiology since age 12. She was maintained with a hematocrit goal
of greater than 23. Her platelets fluctuated as low as 3. She
did receive two units of HLA matched platelets , which increased
her platelets to 19. However , in the past she has been known to
tolerate platelets less than 5 and unless a concern for bleeding ,
I would not further transfuse.
8. Renal: Her creatinine was maintained at her baseline of 1.5.
Electrolytes were fallena and repleted as necessary.
9. Endocrine: Diabetes. Her sugar levels were difficult to
control. She was kept on Lantus as well as Novolog for her
insulin regimen.
PROPHYLAXIS:
Pneumaboots given her low platelets as well as a PPI.
TUBES , LINES AND DRAINS:
She does have a 3 port right IJ catheter in place and which she
will be discharged with until her Hickman can be placed. Follow
up has been scheduled for her to have IR place another Hickman.
Prior to placement , she should have her final blood cultures
evaluated.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Include Dulcolax 10-20 mg ??_____?? p.r.n. constipation , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily , Levoxyl
75 mcg p.o. daily , methadone 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , oxycodone 30-60
mg p.o. q 4h as needed for pain , Zoloft 100 mg p.o. daily ,
levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. 48h , to receive final dose on

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APLASTIC ANEMIA , HERE FOR HICKMAN PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Norsingle history dates back to
1976 , when she was diagnosed with
aplastic anemia. She did not have a bone marrow donor match at
that time and was thus treated with steroids without significant
effect. She has been transfusion dependent since 1986 and has
required q.2 weekly packed red blood cell transfusions and p.r.n.
platelet transfusions for epistaxis. She has had multiple
complications of her aplastic anemia , including hemochromatosis ,
bronzed diabetes , history of hepatitis B and hepatitis C positivity
secondary to transfusions , avascular necrosis of both hips , status
post bilateral total hip replacements , chronic shoulder bony damage
( both orthopedic prostheses secondary to chronic steroid use ) ,
history of perirectal abscess with Klebsiella while neutropenic ,
history of multiple Port-A-Cath infections. Her past history is
also significant for status post total abdominal hysterectomy for
high grade SIL in 1997.
Today Ms. Marsek presents for placement of a Hickman catheter
which had fallen out at the beginning of April of this year.

and 9.
FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for diabetes in multiple family
members.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Pettit is a 35-year-old woman with a long
history of transfusion dependent aplastic anemia
with multiple complications secondary to hemochromatosis and
chronic steroid use. She was admitted for replacement of a Hickman
catheter which had fallen out in April of this year. Prior to the
procedure she was transfused with two bags of platelets. She had
one bag of platelets on call to the Interventional Radiology Suite ,
but did not require these platelets. She was also transfused two
units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 23. On July ,
1999 , she had a right internal jugular venous Hickman catheter
placed without difficulty. There were no complications from the
procedure. There is no pneumothorax by fluoroscopy. The tip was
in the proximal right atrium , okay to use. Both lumens aspirated
freely and were flushed with heparin prior to being sent back up on
the floor. On the evening of July , 1999 , Ms. Deboer began an
infusion of Desferal while in house , watching carefully for signs
of anaphylaxis , as she has not received an infusion in over two
months. After she completes her Desferal infusion , she will be
sent home with visiting nurse for Hickman catheter care and
followup with Dr. Keith Hermans in clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home services for Hickman
catheter care and monitoring of CBC.

decompression , and L4-L5 laminectomy with new L4-L5 , L5-S1
herniated nucleus pulposus , and lower back pain with radicular
symptoms. He described his back pain as 80% of his complaint , and
20% is his radicular symptoms. The pain is greater on the right
than on the left. He has had conservative management. He
complains of bowel and bladder changes with decreased rectal tone ,
and control with urine and feces. He denies any lower extremity
weakness or numbness throughout his perineum. He was recently seen
in the I Ieldwall Health Care Emergency Room on 1/11/02 , for low back
pain and sciatica; however , he left AMA. He presents for elective
decompression and instrument infusion of his lumbar spine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease , GI bleed. A
history of seizure disorder and peripheral neuropathy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilaterally total knee arthroplasty;
shoulder surgery; aortic valve replacement ,
times two; cardiac catheterization; hydrocele repair.
MEDICATIONS: Please see nurse&apos;s note.
ALLERGIES: Coumadin , is not a true allergy , however , he has been
unable to achieve therapeutic INR.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a reformed smoker and drinker. He is a
retired salesman.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pertinent neurologic findings. Bilateral
lower extremity edema. Light touch is
intact throughout with slight decrease in bilateral feet consistent
with neuropathy , left greater than right. Decreased sensation.
Motor strength is 5/5 with the quads , hams , GS , TA , EHL. The left
side fatigues sooner than the right. A negative clonus. DTRs are
equal bilaterally quads , hams and Achilles. Capillary refill is
less than two seconds.
MRI from 6/17/02 , reveals left-sided L5-S1 herniated HNP with
foraminal narrowing.

prior study for comparison.
Laboratory values: Potassium 4.7. Hematocrit 38.5. INR 1.0.
Urinalysis negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent lumbar spine decompression
with L4-S1 instrument infusion with augmentation
of the iliac crest bone graft. Postoperative course was
uneventful. The patient remained afebrile , hemodynamically stable.
Autologous blood was necessary. He was required to maintain a
hematocrit above 30. He remained afebrile. Normal perioperative
antibiotics were given , however. His p.o. intake was delayed
secondary to delay in return of GI function. He did have an
episode of dark emesis early in his postoperative course on
postoperative day #1/2. He was slow to mobilize with physical
therapy. This was in part secondary to his pain level and also
intermittent confusion , for which a medicine consult was obtained.
Kayexalate was given for elevation of his potassium; otherwise , his
confusion resolved with decrease of his narcotic medications.
Physical therapy was able to resume. He was able to advance
appropriately. Hospitalization was prolonged secondary to waiting
for a rehab placement. At the time of discharge , his incision was
clear , dry and intact.

Discharge Date: 11/15/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Delgrosso is a 68 year old female
with known heart murmur since the
1950s. She has a been closely followed since approximately 1990
for multi-valve disease. In early February of 1998 she presented
with chest pressure and was seen at Ga Medical Center for
cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary
artery disease but markedly increased filling pressures. Her right
atrial pressure was 14/16/10. Right ventricular pressure was
75/100 , pulmonary artery pressure was 75/35/50 and her pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 32/36/30. Echocardiogram on 3/16/98 ,
revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly decreased
systolic function with an ejection fraction of 45 percent , normal
right ventricular size and function , moderate mitral stenosis and
three plus mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency and
aortic stenosis , three plus tricuspid regurgitation and a dilated
inferior vena cava.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic fever ,
hypothyroidism , borderline diabetes
mellitus , atrial fibrillation , breast cancer for which she had
radiation therapy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a right lumpectomy in the
1990s. She has had an appendectomy in 1993
and a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the past.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin ( causes rash and itch ).
PHYSICAL EXAM: Unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Copes was brought to the operating room on
4/6/98 where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a #19 St. Jude valve , a mitral valve replacement
with a #27 St. Jude valve and a tricuspid valvuloplasty with a
DeVega annuloplasty. The patient intraoperatively was found to
have a tricuspid valve with a dilated annulus but normal leaflets.
Transient right ventricular dysfunction requiring epinephrine and
nitroglycerin. The patient came off of bypass and was paced. The
patient went back into atrial fibrillation. The patient was
brought up to the intensive care unit in stable condition. Ms.
Kelty was extubated on postoperative day number one. She was noted
to have bradycardia postoperatively which required pacing and she
was found to have no significant underlying rhythm. She was seen
by the electrophysiology service who had suggested we continue
following her and hope to find a recurrence of her AV node
function. She was discharged to the step-down unit on
postoperative day number two. She was found to have an intrinsic
rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a left bundle branch block with
a heart rhythm of 55-65. Ms. Old continued in atrial
fibrillation with a rate in the 80s and was able to come off of her
external pacemaker. The patient was started on Dextran to augment
anticoagulation which increased her INR for discharge planning.
She will be discharged to home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Coumadin as directed; Captopril 25 mg
q 8h , Digoxin 01.25 mg q day , Colace 100
mg three times a day: Levoxil 50 mcg once a day , Lasix 80 mg once a
day , potassium chloride 40 mg once a day.

baseline , cardiac enzymes negative , and prior MRI/MRA in 2004 without
acute process. Her BP remained well controlled back on her home regimen
( ? compliance but she states she was taking her meds ). Will have outpt
MRI/MRA done , though low suspicion for disease and unclear if would
intervene if disease present. Given HTN spells , concern for a cause of
secondary hypertension. Labs sent for plasma catecholamines , aldoseterone

Discharge Date: 7/6/2005
ATTENDING: GOSSOM , GASTON BRADLY MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Status post CABG.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 68-year-old male with a
history of hypertension , dyslipidemia , coronary artery disease
status post PTCA to the LAD x3 in 1992 and twice in 1993. He
also has a history of hypothyroidism and hypocalcemia status post
total thyroidectomy for premalignant lesion. The patient
presented to an outside hospital on 10/2/05 with chest pain
radiating down his left arm. His EKG showed STD depressions ,
troponin was 6.2 , creatinine was 1.4. The patient was
transferred to Cas Medical Center where a cardiac
catheterization done on 10/4/05 revealed 80% proximal LAD
lesion , 75% proximal circumflex lesion , 100% mid RCA lesion and
an ejection fraction of 40%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted , made ready for surgery , taken
to the operating room on 2/7/05 at which time he underwent a
CABG x4 with a LIMA to the LAD and a Y sequential graft that
connects the saphenous vein graft to the aorta to the RCA and
then a sequential left radial artery graft that connects
saphenous vein graft to OM2 and then OM3. Intraoperatively , a
calcified distal ascending and aortic arch found. There was a
soft spot to cannulae. The patient was cooled to 22 degrees and
the distal RCA to the saphenous vein graft anastomosis was sewn
under fibrillatory arrest. Proximal to the aorta was done under
circulatory arrest. Proximal radial anastomosis was placed on
the proximal part of the saphenous vein graft to the RCA.
Immediate postoperative course was uncomplicated. He was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #1.
He was neurologically intact , but been pulling at lines and
catheters stating he wanted them out and trying to climb out of
bed , so he was placed on a 1:1 sitter. Nitroglycerin was weaned.
He was started back on Lopressor and captopril for hypertension.
He had an NG tube placed for gastric dilatation. He was
extubated overnight on postoperative day #1.
On postoperative day #2 , he again was hypertensive. Captopril
was added , increased Lopressor and the diltiazem. He self DC&apos;d
his Foley as well as IV on postoperative day #2 , stating he was
going to leave the hospital. On postoperative day #3 , Psych was
consulted. They felt that imaging was warranted , however , his
behavior improved overnight. He was transferred to the Step-Down
Unit on postoperative day #3. He was in sinus rhythm. His NG
tube had been removed. His diet was being advanced as tolerated.
He was auto diuresing. He was back on his hypothyroid meds. On
postoperative day #4 , he was doing well. He was mobilizing ,
diuresing. Physical therapy was consulted. They felt the
patient would meet the criteria for rehabilitation. A rehab bed
became available and patient was accepted on 3/1/05 .
At the time discharge , Mr. Dedrick looked well. His vital signs
were stable and he was in sinus rhythm. His discharge laboratory
values included sodium 142 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , CO2 25 ,
BUN 22 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose was 94. White blood cell count
was 7.7 , hematocrit 25.4 , platelets 243. His INR was 1. His
chest x-ray revealed satisfactory postoperative appearance. His
discharge condition was stable.

Discharge Date: 4/6/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT GROIN ABSCESS.
PROBLEM LIST: ( 1 ) Status post renal transplantation , living
related donor April 1997 , ( 2 ) hypertension , ( 3 )
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , ( 4 ) pulmonary hypertension ,
( 5 ) hyperthyroidism , ( 6 ) hyperparathyroidism , ( 7 )
hypertriglyceridemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42-year-old white
man who presents with complaints of
fever to 103 and chills , a productive cough and groin pain lasting
three days. At age three , the patient was diagnosed with Wilms&apos;
tumor on the left , which was resected and subsequently treated with
wide field radiation. The patient , thereafter developed
radiation-induced tyroid cancer , at which time he underwent
subtotal thyroidectomy. In addition , the patient developed
radiation nephritis in his remaining right kidney and pulmonary
fibrosis. In April of 1997 , the patient underwent living related
donor renal transplantation for chronic renal failure. The patient
was at that point CMV antigen negative , however , the donor kidney
was CMV antigen positive. The patient underwent an uncomplicated
transplantation , however , the postoperative course was complicated
by cytomegalovirus infection , presenting with diarrhea and
requiring hospitalization in February 1997. The patient was treated
with ganciclovir and subsequently maintained on Cytovene. The
patient remained healthy until August 1997 , at which time he was
again admitted for a recrudescence of his cytomegalovirus
infection. In August 1997 , the patient presented with a
three-day history of fever to approximately 105 , anorexia , dry
cough , fatigue , headache , dizziness , sweats , nausea and dyspnea on
exertion. The patient was , at that point , treated with
ganciclovir , however his fevers persisted and he was discharged
after five days of therapy. At that time , the patient&apos;s CMV
antigen test was negative , however , his shell vial cultures , both
returned as positive. The patient was maintained on ganciclovir
therapy in the post hospital course until April , 1997 , at
which time his peripherally inserted catheter was removed.
Subsequently , the patient has been healthy for approximately four
weeks , then on June , 1998 , he noted a groin lump on the
right. From June , 1998 , he noted feeling
worse with fevers and chills , and a productive cough beginning on
September , 1998. The patient&apos;s groin lump , subsequently , became
painful , and he passed several loose bowel movements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Wilms&apos; tumor , ( 2 ) status post left
nephrectomy with wide field radiation
therapy , ( 3 ) NCH renal disease status post living related donor
renal transplant from father in April 1997 , ( 4 ) hypertension , ( 5 )
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , ( 6 ) pulmonary hypertension ,
( 7 ) hyperthyroid , ( 8 ) hyperparathyroid , ( 9 ) hypertriglyceridemia ,
( 10 ) gout , ( 11 ) CMV infection in February 1997 and August 1997 ,
( 12 ) history of perirectal abscess , ( 13 ) history of atrial
fibrillation spontaneously converted in October 1998.
ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Synthroid 150 mcg q.d. , NPH insulin 14
units q.a.m. , regular insulin p.r.n. ,
nadolol 80 mg q.d. , Prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Neoral 100 mg b.i.d. ,
CellCept 1 g b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. p.r.n. ,
Coumadin 4 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home with his wife and has
four children. He denies alcohol or tobacco use.
FAMILY HISTORY: No coronary artery disease. No history of cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , but ill-appearing
man in some respiratory distress , lying in
bed. Temperature is 103 , heart rate 70 , blood pressure 160/80 ,
respirations 26 , oxygen saturation 90% on 4 L oxygen. HEENT
examination was notable for cushingoid facies and flushing was
evident. No lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple , mucous
membranes moist and sclera were anicteric. Chest examination
revealed crackles on the right to half way up. Heart examination
revealed a noisy precordium with a prominent T2 and a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur. Abdominal examination was negative. Extremity
examination revealed some slight swelling of the lower extremities.
Cutaneous examination was notable for evidence of thin subcutaneous
tissues and development of a buffalo hump.
LABORATORY DATA: White count of 11.3 with 46 polys , 36
lymphocytes and 7 bands , hematocrit was 32.4 and
platelets were 143 , 000. Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin
time of 15.8 and an INR of 1.8. Electrolytes were within normal
limits , blood urea nitrogen was 39 , creatinine was 2.5 , glucose was
85 , calcium 10.2. Liver function tests revealed an alkaline
phosphatase of 342 , total protein was 7.9 with an albumin of 3.9.
Cholesterol was 194 , triglycerides were 249. Cyclosporine level
was 303.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Surgery was consulted and the right groin
abscess was drained and a wick was inserted. This wound was
dressed and continued care was preformed by nursing staff. Blood
cultures on admission revealed no growth and on hospital day two
revealed no growth. Wound cultures revealed few coagulase ,
negative staph. Antibiotics were initiated , first vancomycin ,
gentamicin and Flagyl were initiated , however gentamycin was
subsequently discontinued and ceftazidime was initiated. The
patient had one fever spike on hospital day one to 101.9. The
patient subsequently had no fever spikes , however , on hospital day
three Levaquin was initiated and intravenous antibiotics were
continued until hospital day four. At that point , the patient had
been afebrile for 48 hours and the decision was made to switch the
patient to oral antibiotics , including Levaquin and Augmentin. The
patient continued to defervesce , his breathing improved , the pain
in his right groin improved , dressing changes were continued and
the patient remained afebrile for more than 24 hours after
initiating oral antibiotics.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has a history of hypertension and
has been maintained on nadolol , recently requiring a doubling in
his dose from 40 mg q.d. to 80 mg q.d. He was admitted and placed
on 80 mg q.d. of nadolol , however , his blood pressures continued to
run up to 170 systolic and up to 110 diastolic. At that time , the
decision was made to initiate a second antihypertensive medication
and nifedipine XL was chosen. He was maintained for two days at 30
mg on this medication and his blood pressures subsequently
stabilized at 130/80. The patient also carries a diagnosis of
pulmonary hypertension , presumed from the February 1997 , results
of his echocardiogram. These results revealed a pressure gradient
in the pulmonary arterial system , and on this admission a
subsequent echocardiogram was obtained to assess left ventricular
function and his pulmonary vascular status. The results of this
study revealed 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and 1+ mitral
regurgitation , unchanged from prior studies and a pulmonary
arterial pressure of approximately 45 mmHg , also not notably
changed.
3. PULMONARY: On admission , the patient reported a productive
cough , in addition to difficulty breathing. This was evaluated
with a chest radiogram , which revealed possibility of a right sided
pulmonary process , corroborated on examination by evidence of
crackles half way up. The decision was made to rule the patient
out for another flare of his CMV infection. Studies for CMV
antigen and CMV from the buffy coat were sent and the final results
revealed a positive CMV antigen , but a negative buffy coat. The
patient&apos;s pulmonary status improved on oxygen and on intravenous
antibiotics. A induced sputum sample was obtained and studies were
sent for atypical organisms including CPT , fungi , in addition to
bacteria. All these studies were negative. In addition ,
Legionella antigen was also negative. Prior to discharge , the
patient&apos;s pulmonary status had returned to baseline and had
entirely resolved.
4. GASTROINTESTINAL: On admission , the patient reported multiple
loose bowel movements. However , in his hospital course this did
not continue to be an issue. The patient also regained his
appetite during the hospital course.
5. HEMATOLOGIC: The patient was continued on his anticoagulation
for history of atrial fibrillation at 4 mg daily with an INR
remaining in his goal parameters , which were set at 1.6-2.0. The
patient however , has recently spontaneously converted to sinus
rhythm and throughout his hospital course remained in sinus rhythm
with continuous monitoring.
6. RENAL: On admission , the patient&apos;s creatinine level was 2.5
and remained stable throughout his hospital course. His
cyclosporine level was 303 on admission , on hospital day four , a
level of 700 was obtained , however , this determined from a history
that this level had been drawn shortly after the patient had taken
the cyclosporine. During his hospital course , vancomycin levels
were followed. These levels reached a maximum of 19.8 on hospital
day four , at which time intravenous antibiotics were discontinued.
7. ENDOCRINE. The patient carries a history of multiple endocrine
issues including hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism , diabetes
mellitus , hyperthyroidism on thyroid replacement therapy following
subtotal thyroidectomy , and possibility of mineral corticoid
deficiency. The Endocrine Team was consulted. Thyroid studies and
parathyroid studies were sent and revealed a TSH of 0.02 , a T4 of
6.0 , a THPR of 1.47. On discharge , the patient&apos;s parathyroid 1 , 25
vitamin D and 25 vitamin D were still pending. The Endocrine Team
recommended decreasing his Synthroid dose to a level of 125 mcg
daily. In addition , they recommended a bone densitometry study for
evaluation of his bone mass following chronic maintenance on the
steroid therapy and a history of hyperparathyroidism. The team
thought that the patient&apos;s previous question of a mineral corticoid
deficiency was likely due to his prior Cozaar therapy. They did
not fell it was necessary at this point to preform a cortizone
stimulation study or to further assess this possibility of a
mineral corticoid deficiency.

Discharge Date: 10/8/2005
ATTENDING: LORENSON , REED MD
SERVICE:
RBMC .
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Rule out MI.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Angina , tachycardia , and hypertension.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , chest pain , GERD , coronary artery disease ,
osteoarthritis , anxiety , diverticulosis , hypercholesterolemia ,
and chronic dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with history of coronary
artery disease and difficult to control hypertension who
presented with chest pain in the setting of the elevated blood
pressure and tachycardia. Two days prior to admission , the
patient had developed the abrupt onset of palpitation , chest
pain , diaphoresis , anxiety , and shortness of breath. She took
her blood pressure and this was found to be greater than 200 with
the rapid pulse. She called her PCP and was instructed to call
911. She was taken to the Ha Hstibrook Medical Center ED. Of
note , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days.
In the emergency department , the systolic blood pressure was in
the 180s. This was controlled with her home medications and IV
Lopressor. The patient was ruled out for an MI in ED/OBS. She
went for a MIBI on the morning of admission , but this was
canceled because the patient was dizzy. Of note , the patient has
had an identical admission several months earlier for a labile
blood pressure. During that admission , the patient&apos;s hydralazine
and beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressure
control. She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renal
artery stenosis. She did have elevated plasma metanephrines
during that admission. She was discharged at that point on an
improved antihypertensive regimen as described above. She also
reports having had a similar episode two weeks ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , angina , osteoarthritis , GERD , diverticulosis ,
hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post CABG x4 and
multiple stents , chronic dizziness , stable cath 8/4 .
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
No smoking , no ethanol. She lives in West O Uxkan by herself , has a
helper ( visiting aid ). No family nearby. Her family lives in
Pit Forda Sta
FAMILY HISTORY:
Her brother died at 61 years old of CVA. Her mother died at 75
years old with CVA. Her sister had an MI at age 80.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Vital signs: Heart rate 98 , blood pressure 172/70 with a range
of 103-172/40-70. O2 saturation was 97% on room air. Her exam
was significant for tachycardia with a regular rate , normal S1
and S2 , and soft systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
sternal border. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
CBC was within normal limits. Chem-7 was significant for BUN of
22 and creatinine of 103. Calcium was 10.5 , phosphorus was 2.5 ,
and albumin was 4.3. LFTs were normal. Her D-dimer was 1305.
She had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Coags were normal.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 75 beats per minute ,
left axis deviation , LVH , left atrial enlargement. T-wave
flatting in lead III only.
STUDIES:
1. Chest x-ray ( 9/29/05 ): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. PE CT ( 11/9/05 ): No PE.
3. Head CT ( 11/9/05 ): Left-sided meningiomas , unchanged from
2004.
4. MIBI ( 10/27/05 ): Area of reversible ischemia , unchanged from
2002.
CONSULTS:
Cardiology ( FMCO ): Luke Ollie Buckley .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the setting
of not taking her Toprol. She does have a history of labile
blood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. This
symptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , but
this was ruled out last admission. Renal artery stenosis was
also ruled out last admission. Given the description and the
fact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previous
admission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudo
pheochromocytoma. Studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudo
pheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including
24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned as
negative. Her TSH was normal. She was initially put on q.i.d.
Lopressor and hydralazine. The hydralazine was then discontinued
due to hypotension. Her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL , this
was also discontinued for hypotension. Her ultimate regimen was
titrated based on her blood pressures and eventually she was put
on Avapro 75 mg daily , atenolol 25 mg daily , and her home dose of
Imdur 120 mg daily. Her target blood pressures were 140s to 150s
and with this regimen , she was well controlled and asymptomatic
upon discharge.
2. Ischemia: She was initially ruled out for MI. Her MIBI
showed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite two
catheterizations in intervening time. She was seen by LMH
Cardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. She
was discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free.
3. Dizziness/nausea: She had episodes of this during her
hospitalization. It was of unclear etiology and she has had a
previous significant prior workup ( see previous discharge
summary ). She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and was
discharged home without any dizziness or nausea.
4. Calcium: She had borderline high calcium and a PTH was sent
and returned mildly elevated. This will need to be followed up
as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Stable.
TO DO PLAN:
Further workup for question of elevated PTH in the setting of
high calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg daily.
5. Ibuprofen 400 mg q.8h. p.r.n. pain.
6. Lactulose 30 mL p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. constipation.
7. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. daily p.r.n. anxiety.
8. Meclizine 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. dizziness.
9. Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual every five minutes
x3 doses p.r.n. chest pain.
10. Compazine 10mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
3. Restrictive airway disease.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
6. History of peripheral vascular
disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 82-year-old female
with a past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive lung disease ,
peripheral vascular disease status post right carotid
endarterectomy , status post bilateral femoral to popliteal bypass
surgery , sick sinus syndrome status post cardiac pacemaker
placement in 1993 , history of squamous cell carcinoma and abdominal
aortic aneurysm diagnosed two weeks prior to admission , who
presented to the Town University Emergency Department on
10/7 with a two day history of shortness of breath and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and worsening fatigue times two weeks.
The patient was recently admitted and evaluated in Hoaprings where
she spends a significant part of the winter , and was diagnosed with
a viral syndrome and &quot;asthma&quot; flare. The patient was hospitalized
and underwent a Cardiolite stress test which was negative , as per
her Dy Memorial Hospital primary care doctor ,
Dr. Kuffa . The patient also had an echocardiogram done in
Bar Highway , Anri which demonstrated a normal ejection fraction , but evidence
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without obstruction. The patient
was evaluated with a CT scan in Dale , Indiana 70705 which demonstrated an
abdominal aortic aneurysm greater than 5.0 cm. The patient had had
prior surgery on her abdominal aorta , and the patient was to
follow-up with Dr. Vandawalker at the Stangiles Hospital on
4/20 .  The patient had also been found on the CT scan down in
Et to have a pelvic mass for which she had been evaluated by
ultrasound and Gynecology follow-up has been arranged.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
restrictive airway disease , congestive heart
failure. Recent echocardiogram less than two weeks prior to

for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare
versus chronic pulmonary emboli. The patient had lower extremity
noninvasive studies which demonstrated a left popliteal vein
thrombosis. The patient&apos;s V/Q scan was initially set-up through
the Short Stay Unit. Her V/Q scan was subsequently performed and
read out as intermediate probability of the lower end of the
spectrum by the nuclear radiologist , with significant changes
consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient
was started on initially unfractionated heparin and then
transitioned to Lovenox and Coumadin , and started on prednisone for
a presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. While the
patient was in the hospital , her respiratory status was stable with
oxygen saturations in the high 90 percent range on a maximum of 2.0
liters nasal cannula. At discharge , the patient was sent home off
oxygen. The patient was evaluated by Dr. Kieffer for pacemaker
function and the battery was in need of replacement. The patient
was taken to the Procedure Room on 4/20 and underwent pacemaker
battery replacement by Dr. Bieker without complication. While in
the hospital , the patient had a routine CT scan at the request of
Dr. Legeyt , who will follow-up with the patient regarding surgery on
her abdominal aortic aneurysm shortly after discharge. The patient
was discharged in stable condition.

DIET: The patient is currently on a house diet. TPN was d/c&apos;ed on the day of
discharge.
ACTIVITY: He may walk as tolerated.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Incarcerated chronic ventral hernia status
post sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann&apos;s operation.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Galla in two weeks and
Dr. Caracciolo who is the attending in two weeks. He should also follow up with Dr.
Smutzler , cardiology in 2 months , and Dr. Parramore , GI in 2-4 weeks.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old male admitted for an
incarcerated chronic ventral hernia , postoperative day 6 , status
post sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann&apos;s operation.
Hospital course was complicated by postoperative acute
respiratory failure , respiratory acidosis with metabolic
acidosis , pleural effusion , hypokalemia , myocardial infarction ,
thrombocytopenia , and delirium. He has a known history of penile
cancer status post penectomy complicated by perineal
urethrocutaneous fistula , chronic anemia requiring transfusions ,
non-insulin-dependant diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , obesity , and recurrent UTIs. The patient
had a suprapubic catheter placed by Urology. His postoperative
course otherwise was alright. He started having atrial
fibrillation on 7/28/07 , initially remained stable with normal
blood pressures. He was transferred to the floor on 7/28/07 ,
wherein he developed rapid ventricular response to 120. On
6/6/07 , he began hypotensive with systolics of 70. Cardiology
was consulted. He was initially treated with Lopressor and
diltiazem drip. He remained hypotensive despite IV boluses. He
was switched to amiodarone mode and drip , but again he became
hypotensive. Therefore he was transferred to the unit and given
a digoxin load and was transferred for a possible
electrocardioversion. He remained asymptomatic throughout the
day with low blood pressures. In the ICU , he was again started
and maintained on amiodarone IV. He tolerated it without a
problem. He did have an episode of bright red blood from his NG
tube in the ICU and GI was consulted. They felt given that his
hematocrits have stabilized after two units of packed cells , he
did not need to be urgently scoped. He was started on Pepcid IV
and a Nexium drip , and had hematocrit measured q.6 h. , which
remains normal. He was transferred back to the floor on these
medications and was started on TPN after a PICC line was placed
and continued to do well. He was scoped by GI on 3/24/07 , which
showed diffuse gastritis thought to be due to the NG tube , and
two ulcers turned out bleeding. Postprocedure , he was started on
Carafate and was transferred to Nexium p.o. after he was taking a
diet. Again , his PICC line was safe on 4/15/07 and he was
started on TPN on 9/25/07 .  The NG tube was removed on 3/24/07
and his diet has been slowly advanced. He is being discharged on
TPN as his total caloric needs are still not being met by p.o.
nutrition and he is in good condition on discharge.
He was not anti-coagulated for his Atrial Fibrillation due to his risk of GI
bleeding , as decided by GI.

THICKNESS SKIN GRAFTING
PROBLEMS: 1 ) PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
2 ) HYPERTENSION
3 ) TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS
4 ) ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 49 year-old male who
has developed type II diabetes
mellitus approximately ten years ago but has been without regular
medical follow-up. He has also experienced worsening peripheral
vascular disease. In this context , he was admitted to Mounten Memorial approximately one month ago , when on May , he
underwent debridement of diabetic foot ulcers and amputation of the
right fifth toe. On October , he also underwent a right
femoropopliteal bypass graft. He was discharged from Penzale Bill Clinic on February , 1997 to home , followed by VNA for
dressing changes. He did well postoperatively; however , he began
experiencing increasing pain in both legs over the two days prior
to admission. He treated this with Tylenol. He states this
glucose levels have been doing well , although he is not able to
cite any numbers.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Hypertension. 2 ) Peripheral vascular
disease. 3 ) Type II diabetes mellitus. 4 )
Elevated cholesterol.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission included Vasotec 5
milligrams q.d.; Glyburide 5 milligrams q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco: two packs per day times 40 years ,
presently an active smoker. Alcohol: denies
alcohol intake in the last six weeks; history of previous heavy
alcohol use. The patient is divorced. He currently lives with his
girlfriend. He is currently disabled and is not working.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: GENERAL: 35 pound weight loss over the past
three years. ENT: Recent blurring of vision.
NEUROLOGICAL: Numbness and tingling on the left foot dorsal
surface. CARDIOVASCULAR: Hypertension , but no known history of
cardiac events. PSYCHIATRIC: Admits to some depression.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is an ill appearing , uncomfortable
gentleman in mild distress on admission.
VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Blood pressure 130/82. Pulse 84.
Respiratory rate 16. SKIN: Warm and dry. There are no palpable
nodes. HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation throughout. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal
S1/S2. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , with active bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGICAL: The patient is alert and oriented times three.
EXTREMITIES: There is no edema. There is a right groin incision
with slight separation of the surgical wound at its most distal
aspect , approximately one centimeter magnitude. PULSES: Popliteal
pulse is by Doppler only on both sides. The posterior tibial pulse
is non Dopplerable. The dorsalis pedis pulse is detectable with
Doppler , stronger on the left than on the right. On the left foot ,
there were two necrotic areas on the heel approximately 0.5
centimeter in diameter. The first metatarsal joint has a 1.2
centimeter wound which is dry , tender and not erythematous outside
of its margins , boggy at the distal aspect. There is a small
amount of tan exudate present at the distal wound edge. On the
right foot , there is a distal lateral wound 4.6 centimeters in
width , 3.1 centimeters in length , and 1 centimeter deep. There is
pale green fluffing on the plantar edge of the wound. The right
heel has a 4.2 X 2.5 centimeter open area approximately 2-3
millimeters deep in the wound bed; pink with scattered white
material fluffing. There is no surrounding erythema or bogginess.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , glucose was 81 , sodium 137 ,
potassium 4.7 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN
and creatinine of 18 and 0.9 respectively. CK was 145. CBC was as
follows: white blood cell count of 10 , hematocrit 43.1 , platelets
425 , with a normal differential. Urinalysis was notable only for
1+ protein on the dip.
HOSPITAL COURSE: During admission , the patient underwent a left
femoropopliteal bypass graft and split thickness
skin grafting to the right fifth toe amputation site , as well as
debridement of other lower extremity wounds on April .  He
tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively progressed without
complications. He was taken off epidural pain medications and
switched to p.o. medications and resumed a regular diet shortly
after the operation. The debrided wounds on the right foot were
treated with Xeroform dressings covered with Kerlix and an Ace
bandage. These wounds have shown signs of vascularity and healing ,
and the split thickness skin graft has taken in a satisfactory
manner. The patient has begun to increase his activity with the
guidance of the physical therapist , and is now moving on crutches
with touch down weight bearing of the right foot and no weight
bearing on the right side. There were no complications during this
admission. The patient complained of some blurring in the right
eye. This was followed by an Ophthalmology consult , during which
it was determined that there has likely been a gradual decline in
the patient&apos;s vision due to a combination of development of
cataracts as well as peripheral vascular disease. It was felt that
the appropriate management would be to have the patient return to
Ophthalmology Clinic on an outpatient basis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vasotec 5 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Glyburide
5 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Wellbutrin 75
milligrams p.o. q.d.; heparin 5 , 000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.;

IMP: 60 yo woman with history of CAD and chronic pain syndrome , presenting
with 2 day history of chest pain and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV( I ): With history of CAD and symptoms consistent with new
ischemia , pt was admitted for ROMI. Ruled out with 3 sets of negative
cardiac biomarkers. Underwent myocardial perfusion PET-CT which showed
EF 58% with small area of scarring unchanged from previous study in 2004.
Continued home regimen of ASA , Labetalol , Candesartan , Lisinopril ,
Norvasc , and Plavix. Substituted Simvastatin for Lipitor.
2. CV( P ): On admission , pt appeared euvolemic on exam , with significant
hypertension , thought to be secondary to pain. Continued home
hypertensive regimen , as well as Lasix 40mg BID. Pt&apos;s
hypertension did improve with pain control. However , pt&apos;s creatinine
increased from 1.2 to 1.8 and pt appeared dry on 3rd day of admission.
Lasix was held and pt was given gentle IVF , which resolved ARF to Cr 1.3.
Pt has been instructed to hold her Lasix until Monday 5/18/07 , upon which
she will resume at 40mg daily. She will follow-up with her PCP next week to
assess need to adjust Lasix dosing.
3. CV( R ): Monitored on telemetry with no events.
4. GI: No active issues. Continued PPI.
5. PAIN: Continued home pain med regimen of Oxycontin 60mg q8h plus
oxycodone 5-10mg q4-6h prn for breakthrough. Pt continued to have
significant pain which presented in different locations. Most significant
was right breast/right underarm pain. Suspected etiology of this pain is
exacerbation of chronic pain syndrome vs musculoskeletal. Heating pads
offered some relief. Pt&apos;s pain was improved by discharge with no specific
intervention. Pt will follow-up with PCP to assess resolution of pain.
6. PSYCH: Pt has significant anxiety regarding lack of specific
diagnosis for her increased pain. Also expresses considerable amount
of anxiety/depression over life stressors ( son in Sterl Tuc Wau , recent death of
sister ). Suspect that anxiety/depression may be significantly contributing
to increased pain. Psychiatry was consulted who felt that pt was
expressing normal bereavement and that anti-depressant medication was
not indicated at this time. They recommended follow-up in the
Psychiatry outpatient clinic , for which the patient has been provided
a phone number to call. Pt felt significant improvement of anxiety
after talking to Psychiatry consult. Psych recommended Ativan prn for
anxiety , and pt was given prescription for Ativan 0.5 mg PO prn
for anxiety.
7. RENAL: Pt had ARF on day 3 with increased Cr 1.8 up from 1.3.
Likely dehydration as pt appeared clinically dry. Gave IVF and
held Lasix. Renal U/S was normal ruling out obstuctive etiology. With
hydration , pt creatinine normalized to 1.3 on day of discharge. Pt will hold
Lasix until Monday 5/18/07 , then resume at 40mg daily. Pt will follow-up
with PCP regarding adjusting Lasix dosing as needed.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was admitted to the Foundtah Medical Center surgery service after undergoing
LRYGB. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated
operative note for details. Patient was transferred to the floor from
the PACU in stable condition. Patient had adequate pain control and no
issues overnight into POD1. The patient had an UGI on POD1 and 2 that
were
negative for obstruction or leak but did not show contrast past the
pouch. She did vommit POD 1 , but was able to tolerate the contrast on
POD2. Her lack of empting thought secondary to edema at surgical site and
it resolved by POD 3. The patient was then started on stage I gastric
bypass diet and advanced the following day to a Stage II diet that was
tolerated as well. JP draion removed POD 6. The remainder of the
hospital course was relatively unremarkable , and the pateint was
discharged in stable condition , ambulating and voiding independently , and
with adequate pain control. At discharge the incision was C/D/I , with no
evidence of hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given
explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. Jaffray in 1-2 weeks.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You may shower 2 days after surgery , but do not tub bathe , swim , soak , or
scrub incision for 2 weeks. Bandage strips will fall off over time.
Seek medical attention for fevers ( temp&gt;101.5 ) , worsening pain , drainage
or excessive bleeding from incision , chest pain , shortness of breath , or
any other symptoms of concern. Follow up with your surgeon in 1-2 weeks.
Please do not drive or consume alcohol while taking pain medications.
Resume home medications , but please note: zantac syrup is to replace
nexium. Crush all medicines. ***Please note- START

Discharge Date: 10/1/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION , KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY
DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman
with chest pain syndrome and known
coronary artery disease admitted with increasing exertional
dyspnea , thought to be his anginal equivalent. He was admitted for
medical management and possible laser angioplasty of an occluded
left circumflex coronary artery. In January 1995 , the patient was
admitted with an acute chest pain syndrome. Cardiac
catheterization , at that time , demonstrated 100% occlusion of the
left circumflex artery which was heavily calcified and not amenable
to balloon angioplasty. The patient underwent an exercise
tolerance test on May , 1995 where he exercised six minutes and
stopped secondary to fatigue. The patient had no chest discomfort
or ECG changes during the exercise test. He was discharged home on
a medical regimen , including enteric coated aspirin ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 once a day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. , nitro
patch 0.2 mg per hour , and sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. The
patient also continued on Verapamil SR 240 mg b.i.d. for his high
blood pressure. At home , the patient reports that he has not been
exercising as frequently as he used to and his exercise regimen
usually consisted of 15 minutes on a ski machine three times a
week. He continues to get some exertional dyspnea and also has
episodes of chest pain , usually after a meal , while he is lying in
bed. This probably represents a reflux disease. Due to the
increasing frequency of his dyspneic episodes with exertion , the
patient contacted his primary cardiologist , Jared Stockel , and it
was felt that he probably needed to be admitted for better medical
management and to have an attempted laser angioplasty of his
occluded left circumflex artery.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin one tablet p.o.
q.day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
q.day , Verapamil SR 240 b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mEq q.day , Lopressor 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. , and nitro patch 0.2 mg times two patches times two
hours q.day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an elderly gentleman in no
apparent distress. His heart rate was 52
and regular. Blood pressure was 160/94. HEENT examination was
unremarkable. His lungs were clear. Cardiovascular examination
was significant for an S4 , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs. His abdomen
was benign. His extremities had no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: His ECG showed sinus bradycardia at 56 with left
anterior vesicular block and right bundle branch
block , borderline left atrial enlargement. Chest x-ray was clear.
SMA-7 was normal other than a slightly high creatinine at 1.7 and a
low potassium of 3.1. He had a normal CBC and normal PT/PTT.
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 76-year-old gentleman with known
coronary artery disease , known occlusion of the left
circumflex with an exercise tolerance test one year ago without
evidence for ischemia. He presents with chest pain , shortness of
breath syndrome , etiology of which is unclear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Cardiology NY team where
he underwent a exercise tolerance test on April ,
1996 , during which he went 4 minutes and 22 seconds. He stopped
secondary to dyspnea on exertion and leg fatigue with no chest
pain. He had nonspecific changes in his ECG , and his MIBI images
revealed inferolateral ischemia. On July , 1996 , he underwent
cardiac catheterization with laser assisted PTCA of his left
circumflex lesion , which he tolerated well. His post
catheterization course was slightly complicated by increased
bleeding from the groin site , as well as the possible development
of a hematoma versus pseudoaneurysm as a bruit was heard in the
right groin. This was evaluated with a vascular ultrasound which
showed no hematoma and no pseudoaneurysm. He was observed
overnight and was discharged on 8/26/96 in stable condition. His
blood pressure medications were manipulated for better control of
his significant hypertension , as well as for increased outpatient
compliance. During his hospitalization , urine cultures were sent
which grew alpha hemolytic Streptococcus. This was treated with
ampicillin initially and he will be sent home on pen-VK. Also of
note , during this admission , hemoglobin A1C was sent which was
slightly elevated at 7. He started on glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.day.
However , the patient felt that he did not need to take this and
refused it. His medical team felt that it was more important for
him to be compliant with his hypertension and cardiac medications ,
at this juncture , and the issue of restarting glyburide will be
brought up in the outpatient setting by Dr. Boncella . He is
discharged today , August , 1996 with VNA services to monitor
medicine compliance and measure blood pressures , as well as for a
home safety evaluation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.day ,
Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet
sublingually q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20
mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and pen-VK 250 mg
p.o. q.i.d. times five days.

1. Neurologic: This is a patient with chronic pain syndrome ,
plus or minus history of narcotic addiction and recent detox at
Saddpeace and likely abused/overuse of narcotics prior to
this admission at home. The plan was to treat her without using
narcotics. She was maintained on Tylenol , ibuprofen , tramadol ,
clonazepam , and Zyprexa. On 10/27/06 , she fell in her room and
hit her head on the side of the bed/commode. She denied any loss

midline chest. She did have some mild-to-moderate ischemic and
involutional changes and she had evidence of a prior craniotomy
on the left. Slight asymmetry of the sulci versible since 7/25 .
Ventricles unchanged and within normal limits. She was seen by
the neurology service. They suggested continuing to follow her
neurological exam checking a lipid profile and involving physical
therapy in her care. On their neuro exam , they found that she
had a normal affect , slow procity and tone , a tendency to loose
her chain of thought. Cranial nerves II through XII intact. 4/5
weakness in the left quad and right hamstrings muscles otherwise
5/5 throughout. Upgoing toe on the right and muted on the left.

0/3 at 3 minutes , and 2/3 with multiple choice. Her language was
fluent. She knew the order of recent presidents. Their
impression was that she had an abnormal cognitive exam including
short-term memory and concentration deficits. Recent auditory
and visual hallucinations and delusions in the setting of her
elevated digoxin level and recent falls they did recommend
continued hospitalization and then rehabilitation.
AXIS I: Multifactorial acute delirium and depression and opioid
abuse by history.
AXIS II: Deferred.
AXIS III: Past medical history as described above.
AXIS IV: Severe.
AXIS V: 30.
They recommended treating the underlying causes of delirium ,
which did improve during the hospital stay using Zyprexa 5 mg

spondylosis with reversal of normal cervical lordosis. No
evidence of fracture and left C4 , C5 foraminal lesion. C1
through C4 vertebral bodies were intact. No disc herniation ,
central foraminal stenosis at C5-C6 and the C7-T1 was
unremarkable.
Cardiovascular: Pump: She has a history of aortic root
dissection. Her echo in the past was consistent with aortic root
dilatation , stable. She is maintained on Coumadin for her
valves. Her goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5. Since she was
subtherapeutic at admission she was maintained on Lovenox until
her INR became therapeutic. Her goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5. Her
Coumadin doses were adjusted daily during her hospital stay and
will continue to need to be adjusted. She will need to continue
to have her INR checked daily and her dose generally has been
between 3.5 and 3.75 mg per day. This will need to continue to be
adjusted and the goal should be the higher end of 2.5 to 3.5.
Rhythm: She had a pacemaker placed in the past secondary to a
second-degree AV block. She was continued on her nadolol. Her
digoxin level was held since it was supratherapeutic at admission
and then restarted at 0.125 mg per day. Her digoxin level should
be followed at the skilled nursing facility. Ischemia: She has
no history of coronary artery disease. She is on Lipitor at
home. She was maintained on Zocor 20 mg here and she was not on
aspirin per Dr. Mctigue .

breath and diaphoresis. On 9/30/91 , he again had substernal chest
pain with exertion and was relieved by rest , but recurred with more
exertion. There was no radiation to the neck or the arms. At
Cyhutche Arahagnes Adam Hospital , where he presented with the pain , the

T-waves which were relieved by IV heparin and sublingual
Nitroglycerin. His CK&apos;s at that time were 54 , 59 , 46 , 54 , and 36.
The isoenzymes were negative. On 4/26/91 , he was transferred to
the Firstrybroodi Medical Center .  Catheterization revealed 70-80%
stenosis of the proximal LAD which was thrombosed. His LV function
was approximately 76% ejection fraction. On 5/22/91 , he developed
substernal chest pain after the heparin was stopped , which resolved
with restarting the heparin. On 2/2/91 , he had a PTCA which
decreased the lesion from 90% stenosis to 10% without
complications. On 10/23/91 , he was discharged on Lopressor and
Aspirin. Since then , the patient has been pain free and without
shortness of breath. One day prior to admission , while a passenger

regular rhythm and rate , bradycardiac , S1 and S2 , without murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdominal exam was benign. Pulses were 2+ ,
carotids were 2+ on the right and the left , 2+ at the femorals
bilaterally , the posterior tibialis was 2+ , and the dorsalis pedis
was trace to 0 in both feet. All of the toes were warm. The feet
were warm and without discoloration. Rectal exam was deferred.
Extremities: Without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Were unremarkable. The BUN was 13 ,
creatinine 0.9. He had a CK of 39
initially , and the following results were 33 eight hours after the
initial one , and then 24 eight hours after the second CK. His
liver function tests were unremarkable. The PT and PTT were 11.7
and 30.3 respectively. He had a white count of 8.5 thousand , and
he had a hematocrit of 39.4 with an MCV of 87 and 261 , 000
platelets. His chest x-ray showed normal heart size. There was no
effusions or infiltrates. The EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 55 ,
normal intervals , axis of -60 degrees. There were T-wave
inversions in II and T-wave flattening in III , pseudonormalization
in V2-V3 , with upright T-waves in V4 , V5 , and V6 compared to a
10/23/91 tracing. Because of the atypical nature of the chest pain
and because it did not reproduce the chest pain that he had in
September , the patient was not put on IV heparin. He was given an
exercise stress test , full Bruce protocol , the following day which
showed marked lateral 3-4 mm depressions in the lateral leads ,
consistent with ischemia. He had no chest pain or shortness of
breath during the entire exercise stress test which lasted
approximately ten minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue only.
He was brought to cardiac catheterization on the following day ,
7/7/91 .  A stenosis of the LAD lesion was found in the same place
where this stenosis had been two months ago. PTCA of this lesion
was successful although the final report is pending at the time of
this dictation.
DISPOSITION: He is discharged to home on Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and Aspirin 80 mg p.o. q.d. He is advised to
followup with his physician , Dr. Bruce Dorie at LMMC .  He is
discharged home in fair to good condition. He should have no
difficulties in activities because of this hospitalization.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the hospital for likely UGI bleed given
significant anemia , guaic positive maroon stools and elevated BUN. She
was transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consult
was obtained. GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy on
morning of November .  They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosis
site from her previous bypass surgery. No active bleeding and blood
vessels were identified at the area. This represents the likely source
of her bleed. 2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30
but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially.
It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminitered
and there could have a been a dilutional effect. One more unit was given
for a total of five which put her over 30. Her HCT was monitored and
stayed stable at 30 after that for the remainder of her hospitalization.
She was placed on BID PPI. Her asprin and plavix were held on admission
as well as her BP meds.
---
CV: She does have a history of CAD s/p MI and coronary stents. She
had a negative MiBi a month prior to admission. A set of enzymes upon
admission were negative , another troponin was negative on the
13 of June .  Her HTN meds were held upon admission. Her goal HCT is &gt;30
given CAD. She is on digoxin for question of afib which was on
hold during admission. Cardiac telemetry revealed no events. She had one
episode of &quot;chest pain&quot; on the night of the 13 of June which was actually
located in the epigastric region. An EKG was performed at that time
which was unchanged from the admission EKG. She was HD stable without
event on telemetry. She received NTG tabs X3 without any relief and a
follow up troponin was negative for the third time.
---
PAIN: She was continued on current pain regimen.
---
PPX: Teds , Pneumoboots
---
ENDO: She was continued home Levothyroxine
---
GI: She was constipated during admission and had not had a bowel
movement despite very aggressive regimen. Her abd became slightly
distended. The patient then started to refuse bowel meds as she was
getting prepared for discharge and was afraid to have movement on ride
home. She agreed to maintain agressive regimen at home and was instructed
to follow up with PCP or ER if she can not produce results within a day.
---
She was stable for discharge on January and discharged with instructions
to follow up with PCP within two weeks or sooner if lightheadedness ,
bloody or black stools , vomiting , chest pain or other concerns.

----------------------------------
hospital course: 60F with htn , afib presents with acute onset L sided
chest/back/shoulder pain , atypical for cardiac cp.
1. ischemia: It was felt that patient&apos;s chest pain was likely
musculoskeletal. It was worse with movement of her arms and chest and ws
reproducible with palapation. She was ruled out for MI with serial
enzymes and ekgs. We continued her asa , lowered her dose of bblocker
given bradycardia , and started the patient on an ace inhibitor. She
underwent ETT and went into rate related L bundle branch block. Full
report as follows: 1. Peak METS = 5.7 2. Duke Treadmill Score = +4
( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ) 3. HR Recovery = 29
ASSESSMENT:1. Diagnosis: No evidence for ischemia at HR achieved.
Reduced sensitivity because ECG uninterpretable due to rate related LBBB.
2. Prognosis: Elevated prognostic risk based on low functional capacity
and a low Duke score of +4 ( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ). 3.Arrhythmia:
Probable rate related LBBB at peak. 4. Hemodynamics: Normal exercise
hemodynamics.
Cardiology was consulted and they recommended a MIBI and echo to
better evaluate her cardiac function. She then underwent a MIBI which
showed a small inferior septaldefect , which was thought to likely be
artifact. Given the small area , it was felt medical management would be
the best approach. She was discharged on small dose of bblocker , ace
inhibitor asa and statin.
Pump: The patient&apos;s lasix had recently been increased to 60 mg bid. She
was not felt to be volume overloaded and was continued on this dose in
house. Her echo was done on the day of discharge and can be followed up
as an outpatient. Her blood pressures ran on the low side so she will
be discharged on a lower dose of her bblocker.
rhythm: Patient has underlying conduction system disease
with 1 degree av block and developed a left bundle branch block at a HR
of 150 during her ETT. She was continued on coumadin for h/o
afib
musculoskeletal pain: pain improved with standing tylenol and motrin
standing , with oxycodone for breakthrough
endocrine: Her fasting glucoses showed borderline glucose intolerance
with values around 110. These should be followed as an outpatient.
fen: low fat , low salt diet
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please follow up with you primary care provider. You did not have any
signs of significant heart disease. Please call your doctor if your
shortness of breath worsens , you develop new chest pressure , or you feel
lightheaded.
We have started a new medicine for your blood pressure and have lowered
the dose of your other blood pressure medicine.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
f/u final MIBI results
f/u final echo results
f/u electrolytes on ace-inhibitor
consider PFTs to better evaluate reason for progressive shortness of
breath on exertion ( does not appear to be cardiac in cause )

Discharge Date: 11/10/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS IN THE DISTAL
RIGHT POPLITEAL VEIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old former
triage nurse who has suffered from
degenerative joint disease since 1977 when she was hit by a Amasa Di Cison
bus. She was hospitalized at that time and had a left calf deep
venous thrombosis secondary to extended bedrest. Her joint disease
involved primarily the L4 to S1 vertebra ( comprising two joint
spaces , and she reported this to have been exacerbated by an
attempted rape in 1980. At present , the patient suffers
considerable daily pain inhibiting her ability to work. The
patient recently received a facet block in October of 1991 at the
Dukey Darnha Hospital by the Pain Service which only seemed
to increase her pain. She described steadily worsening pain in
recent months and an increased portion of her time is therefore now
spent at bedrest due to her decreased mobility. The patient
described first experiencing left calf pain one and a half weeks
prior to this admission which manifested itself as a crampy pain of
short duration. She apparently saw her private medical doctor at
this time , Dr. Denver Lehnen , who sent her out on nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. On 4/12 , five days prior to admission ,
the patient awoke at night with severe right leg cramping. She , at
that time , went to the Mutes Hospital Emergency
Room where a noninvasive vascular study was positive for non
obstructive peroneal vein thrombosis. She was discharged on
Anaprox. On 4/29 , the patient returned to the DMC Emergency Room
complaining of increased pain and with great anxiety due to her
perceived risk of pulmonary embolus. The patient has had this
condition in the past and was quite concerned about it. Noninvasive
vascular studies at that time showed the lesion to be obstrutive in
the peroneal vein. However , there was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis at that time. She was discharged on Coumadin , 5 mg q
day. On 8/18 , the patient experienced further worsening pain and
came to the Versteo University Medical Center for a second opinion. She
was heparinized in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Medical
Service. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied chest pain ,
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea or constipation , any recent weight loss or any
additional constitution of symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Occasional migraine headaches. L4-5 ruptured disc status post bus
accident in 1977. As stated above , she had a left lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis following that hospitalization. Previous
positive PPD , she had one year of treatment. Mugging in 1980 with
exacerbation of her joint disease. Emergency Room admission in 1988
for questionable cholecystitis. Facet block times two in 1986 and
1991. Periods of incremental menorrhagia. She is followed by Dr.
Ceo at the Warestar Medical Center .  Endometrial biopsy
recently performed was negative. Asthma. Gastritis. Appendectomy.
ALLERGIES: FISH. ERYTHROMYCIN. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. FAMILY
HISTORY: The patient was raised by foster parents. She has some
knowledge of her natural parents. Her mother was retarded and died
of a pulmonary embolism. Her maternal grandmother had an
endochondroma. First cousin with pancreatic cancer. Maternal
grandmother had cancer of the cervix. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is
divorced times 11 years. She lives with her 16-year-old daughter.
She has a positive smoking history. She denied drinking. She
denied intravenous drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a well developed ,
well nourished white woman in no acute
distress. The patient is mildly agitated and overly circumstantial
in her dialogue. Blood pressure 112/78. Pulse 100. Respiratory
rate is 24. Temperature 99.3. Skin was without lesions. HEENT
exam was within normal limits. Neck was supple without adenopathy.
She has a positive right anterior cervical mobile mass which
appeared to be a lipoma. She was without any jugular venous
distention. Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. Breast
exam was refused. Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2 without S3 , S4 or any rubs , murmur or gallop.
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds. Abdomen was soft ,
nondistended without any hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had
normal sphincter tone , no masses , guaiac negative. Extremities
revealed right calf tenderness to palpation , slightly swollen , no
warmth , positive Homan&apos;s sign. No cords were felt. The left calf
was unremarkable with some point tenderness and right inner thigh ,
again no cords felt. There was no CVA tenderness. There was
positive point tenderness in the region of L4-5 , L5-S1.
Neurological exam revealed the patient to be alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. No deficit of
sensory proprioception or position sense.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 140. Potassium
of 4.3. Chloride 105. Bicarb of 30. BUN 25.
Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 89. CBC was notable for a white blood
cell count of 11.9 with 22 lymphocytes , 7 monocytes , 67
neutrophils , 2 eosinophils. Hematocrit was 41.4. Platelet count
150 , 000. PT was 16.6. PTT 29.8. All other values were within
normal limits. Urinalysis was significant for a pH of 8.0 , 1-3
white cells , 0-2 red cells , 1+ bacteria. Chest x-ray was
remarkable for no infiltrates or effusions , positive hiatal hernia.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm at 90 with intervals of 0.18/0.08/0.36 ,
no ST changes , no change since 11/23 .
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 49-year-old female with a
history of prior deep venous thrombosis with
recent decreased mobility who presented with a painful right calf
with a documented right peroneal vein obstruction. Although the
clot is only documented to be below the knee , the question of
progression must be addressed. Initially , in light of strong data
supporting these events , anti-coagulation to prevent progression of
these clots , the decision was made to further anti-coagulate the
patient as she had minimal risks for this procedure. On admission ,
there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by history of physical.
Right calf pain/deep venous thrombosis: On the second hospital
day , the patient had noninvasive Doppler studies of her lower
extremity which were significant for deep venous thrombosis in the
distal right popliteal vein. There were no other abnormalities
seen in either lower extremity. The patient was initially treated
with heparin since her PT was subtherapeutic on admission and
continued on Coumadin. By the second hospital day , the patient was
therapeutically Coumadinized and the dose was adjusted accordingly
with the goal of 17 to 19. As far as her leg pain was concerned ,
the patient was treated with Percocet for this problem. Physical
therapy came and evaluated the patient and helped her with
regaining her mobility. She was fitted with compression stockings.
Arrangements were made for VNA for the patient upon discharge.
2 ) Back pain - This is a longstanding problem for which this
patient has been treated for for many years. She refused any
consultation at this time by the Carmau Comgarf Hospital Pain Service. Instead , we
treated her with Percocet for these symptoms. 3 ) Agitation -
Patient is extremely agitated demonstrating almost hypomanic state
with pressured speech and Flight of ideas. She was initially on
Clonipin on admission on which she was maintained. In addition ,
she was given additional benzodiazepines to help with sleep.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. Patient was
therapeutically anti-coagulated and she was given a
regimen of Coumadin to take to be followed by Dr. Garth Schoenborn .
Disposition is to home with visiting nurse service. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 5 mg q.d. , Clonazepam
0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet one tablet p.o. q.4-6h. , Darvocet l00
mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. , Senokot 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and Cimetidine
300 mg p.o. t.i.d. Patient is to be followed by Dr. Gino D Wiece .

2 ) PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSED 8/21 STATUS POST
RADIATION THERAPY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 69 year old man without
prior cardiac history. He had cardiac
risk factors including possible hypertension and possible history
of hypercholesterolemia. The patient had had a history of atypical
chest pain including cardiac work-up in the past with an echo in
1995 showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal ejection fraction
at this time. In 8/7 , he had an exercise tolerance test at which
time he went eight minutes with a maximal heart rate of 151 ,
maximum blood pressure of 226/90 , and no EKG changes. At 2 p.m. on
the day of admission , he developed substernal chest pain with
crushing tightness radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was
not short of breath. He experienced this pain on and off through
the afternoon although the pain was never completely gone. At 6
p.m. , he became acutely worse and at that time , called the EMT and
was brought to the Agund Hospital Emergency
Department. Within the Emergency Department , the patient was noted
to have ST elevations in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in
the TONSCHAPTECH MEDICAL CENTER trial. Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was
given Lopressor , oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and Heparin. He did
not drop his pressure with the sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included prostate cancer in 8/21 status
post x-ray therapy as well as a possible
transient ischemic attack in 1990.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Zantac p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was married with three children and he
denied any tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission demonstrated a well appearing
black male in no acute distress. His vital
signs were a heart rate of 48 , blood pressure 83/30 in the
Emergency Department , and he was afebrile with oxygen saturation of
99% on two liters. HEENT: Examination showed oropharynx benign
and he had a left facial droop. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without
bruit , and jugular venous pressure was normal. CHEST: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Had a regular bradycardic rhythm
with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive normal bowel sounds and no
organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused , and no clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema with trace distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL: He was
alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves II-XII were grossly
intact except for a left facial droop , and motor and sensory were
grossly intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136 , white count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8 ,
troponin on admission was 0.0 , INR was 1.0 , and PTT was 22.6.
Patient&apos;s first EKG in the Emergency Department showed normal sinus
rhythm at 70 with first degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees , he had
ST elevations of 4 mm in leads III and aVF and 3 mm in II , and ST
depression of 0.5 to 3 mm in V2 through V5 , I , and aVL. Chest
x-ray did not show acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his EKG changes but
had persistent jaw pain remaining at 10/25 .  He was taken to
catheterization which demonstrated a mid right coronary artery
lesion of approximately 95% with a clot but with TIMI 3 flow. No
intervention was done at that time. Patient initially required
vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good blood pressure but
remained essentially stable and pain free. He had a drop in his
hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his catheterization
secondary to blood loss at the right femoral triple-lumen site
placed in the Emergency Ward prior to TPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma , and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the floor where he
maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
postmyocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the catheterization laboratory to have
PTCA with stenting of his lesion and to see if it continued to
persist. The patient was taken on the day prior to discharge back
to the catheterization laboratory where he was successfully
angioplastied and stented. Immediately on returning to the floor ,
the patient did have a rigor postcatheterization but he remained
afebrile and did well over the remainder of his hospital course.
It was felt that the rigor was probably related to allergic
reaction to the dye as he was treated with Benadryl and steroids
without complication.
DISPOSITION: The patient will have visiting nurse services. He
will have blood drawn to check platelets in two days
as he had a fall in his platelet level to 60 after the
administration of the reapro. He will also need follow-up CBC in
two and four weeks because he is on ticlid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , sublingual
nitroglycerin p.r.n. chest pain , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and
ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to complete a two week course.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Marvin Snachez ,
cardiologist with EANH .  He will have echocardiogram
done on his first hospital visit. The patient will also follow-up
with Dr. Lorenzo Campoverde in the clinical trial center as follow-up for
his participation in the OERD HOSPITAL study.

Discharge Date: 5/28/1999
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This patient presented with an acute stroke and
was brought in by her daughter.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sixty-six year old obese African
American woman of previous CVA of
unclear etiology and unclear clinical sequelae. She was driving as
a passenger in a car around 11:00 o&apos;clock in the morning and
experienced a sudden speech arrest which was witnessed by her
daughter-in-law. She has also difficulty moving her right arm and
she had some tearing of her left eye as well as a skewed look on
her face. By 11:40 a.m. , the ambulance had arrived and she was
admitted to the Koote Hospital emergency department
where the protocol for acute stroke was instituted. The patient
had a CTA done which showed questionable luminal narrowing of the
distal left middle cerebral artery. CT scan was normal and the
patient was given intravenous TPA at 1323 p.m. She was given a 9
mg bolus dose over two minutes and 81 mg given over the following
hour. She was transferred to the neuro. intensive care unit of
Ham Tertnough Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY; Diet controlled diabetes , obesity ,
hypertension as per the Rinn Maield Pinessi Hospital internal
medicine associate records. She also has history of ulcerative
colitis and is on treatment. She is status post MI in 1988 and
there is question of an old stroke in the past. There is also
question of asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Currently is aspirin 325 mg and Asacol although she
wasn&apos;t sure of the dose.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Nonsmoker , married with several children. At
baseline , she is wheelchair dependent due to
chronic hip and back pain although she ambulates at home.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealed chronic mild shortness of breath.
FAMILY HISTORY: There was no significant other family history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION; Blood pressure is 138/76 , heart rate was 80
and paced. She was an obese lady lying on
her back. HEAD AND NECK: Revealed no evidence of trauma. There
were no bruits in the neck. CHEST: Clear. There were bilateral
wheezes. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Normal , obese
with no edema. NEURO: The patient is awake and alert , looking
around. She was mute however. She was able to follow one step
commands. She had a question of a right field compromise
difficulty crossing the midline. She had a right upper motor
neuron seventh weakness with decreased power on the right side of
the face. She had flaccid right arm. Her right leg had some power
with flexion at the knee but was generally weak. She had optimum
coordination and absent pinprick and proprioception on the right.
All of this was documented at 12:30 a.m. By 14;30 a.m. , after the
patient was given intravenous TPA , the patient&apos;s language had
returned completely to normal. She had normal speech including
comprehension and naming. Her ability to distinguish left from
right was intact. Her repetition was intact. SHe had full range of
movement of the eyes with full fields of confrontation. She had a
mild right arm drift on the right side but her strength was 4+/5
distally and proximally. There was normal power in the right lower
lobe and the plantars were normal. There was no increase in
reflexes. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit
for the neurological service of Teaspell Diee Hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE: Blood pressure monitoring was instituted per
protocol , nasal oxygen was given and no antiplatelet
therapy was given for 24 hours. Head of bed was raised to 30
degrees. Head CT was repeated the following morning , the results
of which show that there is slight left basal ganglion internal
capsule , acute and subacute infarct in the left middle cerebral
artery distribution which was evolving from the previous study.
THere was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient had
further investigations to look for a cause of this presumed embolic
stroke. She had an echocardiogram done which showed the aortic
root at 3.5 cm , the atrium at 3.2 which is slightly dilated. There
was normal ventricular size and overall preserved systolic
function , trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,
trace mitral regurgitation. Holter monitor was done which showed
persistent atrial flutter. The patient was coumadinized and some
discussion pertaining to cardioversion was entertained by the
electrophysiology service. However , this was not done as an
inpatient. The patient continued to do remarkably well after her
intravenous thrombolysis over the next couple of days. She had
persistent drift on the right arm; however , her speech remained
completely normal. SHe was reviewed by the chronic pain service on
several occasions for chronic back and leg pain. She reached
normal levels of Coumadin within several days and was discharged
without rehabilitation. She will be followed by the cardiac
service and a plan for complete cardioversion was instituted within
one month. The patient went home on Coumadin. She was finally
discharged on 5/11/99 .

Discharge Date: 7/6/1997
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT X TWO , 26 of July .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was admitted to the
Cardiology Service on 24 of October for
work-up of unstable angina. She is a 72-year-old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors , admitted with unstable angina.
Cardiac risk factors include postmenopausal , age , hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , and diabetes. She presented to the hospital with a
one week history of intermittent chest pain at rest. On 10 of April ,
she presented to E Hospital with postprandial
chest pain , no EKG changes , and she was admitted to the CCU to rule
out myocardial infarction. ETT on 4 of November was positive. The
patient was sent home with plan for outpatient MIBI scan and was
instructed to call the primary M.D. if she had recurrent chest
pain. She developed recurrent chest pain within 48 hours of
discharge but did not call her doctor. The pain resolved
spontaneously but recurred with rest or exertion. She was
readmitted to the Libay Ry Healthcare Health on 24 of October with
worsening chest pain. Her saturation was found to be 88% and she
had evidence of congestive heart failure. An EKG revealed ST
elevation in V1 , V2 , and inferior leads. The chest x-ray showed
moderate congestive heart failure. She was treated with IV TNG ,
Heparin , aspirin , Lopressor and the chest pain improved. EKG
changes normalized but persistence of concave ST segment elevation
in inferior leads. The patient was admitted for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease; positive Persantine
thallium scan in 1994; insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; previous tobacco
smoker; glaucoma; cataract; nephrolithiasis; chronic renal
insufficiency with creatinine in the 2.0 range.
ALLERGIES: Lisinopril with cough.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Mevacor 40 milligrams once a day ,
Isordil 20 milligrams t.i.d. , Axid ,
Atenolol 50 milligrams once a day , NPH insulin 44 units in a.m.
with 22 units in p.m. , Cozaar 25 milligrams once a day , Dyazide 25
milligrams once a day , and eye drops.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 70-regular , blood pressure
130/80 , respiratory rate 20 , 100% on face
mask. No jaundice , no anemia , no cyanosis , no clubbing , no pedal
edema. The lungs were clear to auscultation. The heart was
regular with positive S4 , no murmurs. The abdomen was obese , soft ,
benign. No evidence of varicose veins , all peripheral pulses were
palpable. The neurological examination was intact.
LABORATORY DATA: The EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with ST
elevation in the inferior leads. The sodium was
144 , potassium 5.3 , chloride 109 , CO2 17 , BUN 51 , creatinine 2.4 ,
glucose 251 , WBC 13.7 , hematocrit 36.1 , and placement 253.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the ICU and was taken
to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on
28 of November and underwent cardiac catheterization. The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 16. The patient had 99% obtuse
marginal one stenosis , 90% ramus stenosis , 80% mid-LAD artery
stenosis involving the diagonal 1 , which in addition had a 90%
lesion , an 80% distal LAD lesion at the apex. The patient was
taken to the Operating Room on 26 of July and underwent coronary
artery bypass graft x two with LIMA to LAD , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal branch 1. Postoperatively , she was taken to the
ICU where she was extubated in postoperative day 1. However , her
respiratory status progressively worsening with increasing oxygen
requirement and she was reintubated on 11 of July .  Throughout this ,
she was aggressively diuresed and she was slowly weaned off the
ventilator. She had a bout of atrial fibrillation on postoperative
day 5 , which responded to Lopressor. Her hypertension was treated
initially with IV Hydralazine. In view of the extreme slow wean
off the ventilator , a Pulmonary consultation was obtained and on
their advise , diuresis was continued and she was weaned down to
pressor support and was fully extubated on postoperative day 7.
She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day 8 where she
continued to do well except for intermittent bouts of atrial
fibrillation. She has , however , remained in sinus rhythm for the
past 96 hours and she is being discharged in a stable condition on
postoperative day 13 , on 22 of November .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 60 year old female with a history of breast cancer and
chemotherapy induced CMP( EF 20% , followed by CMP clinic; on 2 L O2 at
night ) , COPD , s/p DVT now anticoagulated , HTN , afib , DM , admitted
with presumed CHF flare. Ms. Guerena was recently admitted for
CHF flare and received intravenous diuresis. She reponded well and
was discharged at a dry weight of approximately 185 pounds. Ms.
Kimmell presented on this admission with 2 days of increasing SOB ,
abdominal discomfort , nausea and vomitting. She denied increasing
edema , change in number of pillows. She did endorse PND present but
states that it is unchanged. In ED , the patient was afebile , inital
ly with oxygen saturation in the high 90&apos;s on 2 L. BP 154/84. BNP was
greater than 3000. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Abdominal CT was
obtained due to concern for the patients abdominal pain and showed
an engorged , fatty liver , ascites , pleural effusions ( not seen
on CXR ). A surgical consult was obtained and the surgeons felt the
patients abdominal pain was not surgical in nature but rather secondary
to CHF.
Hospital Course:
1 ) Cardiovascular: a ) Pump- CHF exacerbation. We diuresed the patient
initially with intravenous lasix until her respiratory status
imroved and the patient was able to maintain good oxygen saturation on
room air. At the time of discharge her oxygen saturation on room air
was in the high 90&apos;s and was between 94-96 % with ambulation. We
continued the patient&apos;s home doses of beta blocker , angiotension
receptor blocker and statin. The patient was again encouraged to
adhere to a low-salt diet and weight herself daily. The patient will be
discharged on Torsemide 100 mg po q am and 50 mg po q pm , a regimine t
has worked will for the patient in the past. She will f/uw iht the
Naiimo Hospital CHF Clinic ( Harold Gohring ) on 5/6 at 10:30 am. The
patient will be followed by Rangespo Chica Li VNA who will assist in her CHF
monitoring and assess her for home PT. b ) Rhythm- The
pa tient is know to have frequent PVCs and non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia which was agian noted on this admission on telemetry.
She was asymptomatic with the NSVT and remains hemodynamically stable.
We obtained an electrophysiology consult to evaluate the need for an
AICD or biventricular pacing. The patietns electrolytes and magnesium
were monitored and rempleted and she was maintained on a beta blocker.
On 2/14 the EP service placed a VVI/R ICD device without complications.
It was interogated ont he day of d/c and the patietn was provided with
written instructions from the EP service for d/c. She will follow-up
with the Dr. Cradduck on 10/30 as described. c ) Ischemia:
Patient with a history of CAD.
ED initially concerned for a myocardial infarction. She was ruled o
ut for an MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. Serial EKG&apos;s
were unchanged. We continued the patient on ASA , beta blocker , s
tatin and ARB. 2 )Heme: Ms. Egerton has a history of DVT , therapeutic
on coumadin at the time of admission. We did decreased her
dose while being treated with levofloxacin. In addition her coumadin
was held for her EP procedure. At the time of d/c she will be
resuming her regular dose of coumadin and should follow-up at her
usualy JMC lab to have her INR checked on Thursday 5/6 .  3 )ID: +UA on
admission treated for three days with levofloxacin. ( Last day was
11/19/4 ). Her cx grew citrobacter which was sensitive to levo. Repeat
UA was negative. 4 ) GI: Abdominal discomfort presumably due
to hepatic congestion. Abdominal CT showed no acute surgical process.
Abdominal pain was resolved with diuresis. She does have a
chronic elevated alk phos which may be related to her
sarcoid. 6 )Endocrine: Continued
levoxyl for the patient&apos;s hypothyroid. Pt with IDDM. We decreased
her lantus dose from 50 u sc to 30 u sc on admission as po
intake was initially low. Pt can resume regular
insulin dose after discharge when she resumes her
outpatient eating habits. 7 ) General: PT consulted to assist in
prevention deconditioning while in the hospital. VNA will evaluate need
for home PT services.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Weight yourself daily , call your doctor when your weight increases
2. Follow-up with your Primary Care Physician in 2 weeks
3. Follow-up at the CHF clinic on Thursday 5/6 with Jeffry Vaudrain at
10:30am.
4.New Medication: ( Replaces lasix ) Torsemide 100 mg every morning and
100 mg po everynight.
5. Follow-up with Dr. Newsome ( 396 )540-2094 3/11 at 9:30 am for your ICD.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Keep appointments as outlined above.
2. Have your INR checked on Friday 5/6 .
3. Weight yourself daily. Call your PCP if your weight increases.
4. Follow written EP discharge instructions.
5. Fort VNA will resume services adn follow pt for CHF as well as

Discharge Date: 6/3/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. TYPE II DIABETES X15 YEARS.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
4. LEFT CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
6. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
7. SILENT INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1990.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old female
with multiple medical problems ,
including coronary artery disease , status post stent to the left
circumflex in 1999 , silent MI in 1990 , hypertension , type II
diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , who presented to an outside
hospital with acute onset of shortness of breath that occurred
while the patient was watching T.V. This dyspnea was associated
with chest heaviness , but the patient denies nausea , diaphoresis ,
or radiation. The patient reports similar symptoms when she
presented in 4/5 to an outside hospitalization and was ultimately
stented for a left circumflex lesion. On the day of admit , the
patient was seen at the Odaughters Nyco Centspan Hospital , where she was
apparently in respiratory distress , and treated with oxygen ,
nitroglycerin , aspirin , Lasix , CPAP , and morphine. Chest x-ray , by
report , showed CHF. The patient improved with diuresis and was
admitted on a R/O protocol for flash pulmonary edema. Her
troponin-I and initial two CKs were flat. She was then transferred
here for cardiac cath , as cardiac ischemia was the suspected
culprit for her presentation. The patient states she sleeps with
one pillow. She has no PND or palpitations. She further denies
fevers , chills , constipation , nausea , vomiting , cough , bright red
blood per rectum , melena , or dysuria. The patient denies diet or
medicine indiscretion. The patient has had no further chest pain
or shortness of breath since the day she was admitted to the
outside hospital.

MCV 88 , RDW 13. PT 11.6 , INR 0.9 , PTT 25.1. Urinalysis showed 1+
protein , 3+ blood , 2+ leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 35-40
white cells , 80-85 red cells , 1+ bacteria , 1+ epi , no casts. EKG ,
on admission , showed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 , LVH with probable
strain laterally. No significant changes from an EKG done on
1/25/99 .  Of note , an EKG done at the outside hospital on 2/10
showed inverted Ts in I , L , and V2-V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to this hospital with a
recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. When
this had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed
an occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were ,
therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either
of the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin was
held. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she
underwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study were
as follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid
D1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior
catheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widely
patent. The patient&apos;s RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling
with collaterals from left to right. At the time of the
catheterization , the patient&apos;s renal arteries are also evaluated.
There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis.
However , no other renal disease was noted.
Because the patient&apos;s catheterization was unchanged from a prior
study , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. For
this reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results of
which are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce ,
heart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercised
for 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She had
no new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the test
showed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct
ischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , it
is felt that the patient&apos;s CAD is an unlikely explanation for her
presentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decide
whether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The most
likely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction
given her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested in
enrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor
blockers in treatment of this disorder.
The patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The left
ventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient has
apical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle size
and function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atrium
with mild mitral regurgitation.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary care
physician in two weeks and her primary
cardiologist in four weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
Please note that an addendum to this discharge summary will be
added with the patient&apos;s discharge medications.

HPI: This is an 81 year old female with a history of CVA , CAD , diastolic
heart failure , PAF , congenital non-fused C1 ring who presents with L
sided total body pain , weakness and worsening DOE. Her pain started while
undergoing physical therapy of her L shoulder. She reports balance
problems and difficulty ambulating at home. She has had chronic R
shoulder pain for 5 years , and had neck pain for 2 months. She had a
negative CTA in 6/12 .  She had a neck CT 6/12 which showed DJD. After
second PT visit on Thursday 4/19 she awoke the next morning with severe
pain in L neck and head , her neck pain is worse with extension , and
improved with flexion. She reports pain throughout the L side of
her body but specifically at the location of L LE varicose veins. She
also feels alternating heat and cold on L side of body. She reports
difficulty walking well now because of pain , weakness , fatigue and
dyspnea. She has been taking tylenol for pain and this helps. She also
reports abd pain and nausea , and vomited yellow vomit am of admit. ROS
positive as well for worsening DOE , stable two pillow orthopnea ,

---
Assessment and Plan: This is an 81 year old female with multiple
medical problems who presents with multiple vague complaints. She likely
has more than one medical issue going on simultaneously.
--
CV:
ISCHEMIA: Pt has known CAD. Worsening angina with exertion. No s/s
of ACS currently. EKG shows no ST segment elevations. Checked set of
cardiac enzymes which were negative. She was continued on asa , statin , BB
-
PUMP: The pt has history of diastolic heart failure. ECHO over one year
ago showed EF 55-60%. It also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation. Her
symptoms of DOE , fatigue , LE swelling , abd girth could also be explained
by Cor Pulmonale or worsening heart failure. A CXR was performed
which showed stable cardiomegaly and no signs of overt edema but
clinically with her elevated JVP , increased abd girth and LE edema
were suggestive of fluid overload. BNP was low at 122 but likely she was
somewhat overloaded. An ECHO was performed which showed elevated
pulm artery pressure of 45 , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , mild to
moderately enlarged R ventricle and moderately enlarged Right atrium. EF
of 60%. These findings are suggestive of potential cor pulmonale. Plan is
to diurese pt as outpt and repeat ECHO by PCP as outpt , then
consideration of cardiology referral. Lisinopril is added as allergy
( hyperkalemia ) , perhaps can be given as small dose with close monitoring.
Defer to PCP. The pt was placed on strict I/Os , daily weights. Avoided
fluid restriction given low BP for now.
-
RHYTHM: The pt has fatigue , dizziness , nausea raising the concern for
dig toxicity. She also has known afib. A digoxin level was checked and
came back at 1.4 which might be slightly high for her renal function ,
age and muscle mass. Her digoxin dose was therefore decreased to 0.125mg
daily. She was monitored on telemetry which showed frequent ventricular
pacing and occasional PVCs.
---
ORTHO: The pt had CT of cervical spine in October &apos;07 for neck pain
radiating to the L , as is her current presentation. The CT showed DJD
but no fracture or other concerning finding. No recent trauma. Her pain
is likely from worsening DJD. Plan conservative intervention with
hotpacks , Tylenol. No further imaging indicated. Home PT planned.
---
NEURO: The pt has hx of CVA but current CTA shows no evidence of
acute CVA. Her Neuro exam is fairly unremarkable despite multiple
vague complaints of weakness , numbness , pain. She was continued on
asa. Neuro exam monitored without focal deficits. Treated headache with
Tylenol. If the pt&apos;s overall pain persists , she might benefit from pain
consult as outpt
---
PULM: Pt has no known pulm disease but has been prescribed albuterol
inhaler. If she in fact has pulm HTN , she may have causative pulm
etiology. CXR showed no acute pulm issues. If ECHO suggestive , PFTs as
outpt per PCP.
---
GI: Bowel regimen for constipation. PPI for GERD.
---
ENDO: Pt has IDDM. It is not exactly clear what she takes for insulin at
home because she reports that she only takes NPH once a day despite the
prescription in WBMC .  She is unclear on her doses or timing of insulin.
She was hypoglycemic upon admission. Check Hgb A1C--&gt; 7.4. She was
started on Sliding scale Novolog and AM NPH for the time being. Monitored
FS which were reasonable. PCP to cont management.
---
FEN: Monitored fluid status. Monitored lytes. Avoided K scale while
on digoxin. Low fat , Low chol , NAS , carb controlled diet
---
PPX: Lovenox
CODE: Full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. VNA to help with medication reconcilliation. VNA-please go through all
medication bottles in the house and sort out the current ones , help
patient make pill box with most current medications.
2. Digoxin dose has been lowered this admission from 0.25mg to 0.125mg
daily. Lasix has been increased temporarily to BID for diuresis until
follow up with PCP.
3. VNA to check sodium , potassium and digoxin level June .
4. VNA to check BP while on bid lasix. Hold dose if SBP &lt;95 and call PCP.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Monitor fluid status/electrolytes. Repeat ECHO after diuresis. Consider
Cardiology consult for ?Cor Pulmonale.
Monitor renal function and digoxin level.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 66 yo woman with a hx of CAD , emphysema , HTN , and DMII
who presents with a 2 month hx of progressive dyspnea on exertion who
was found to desat on ambulation today to the mid 80s. The patient had
a prior CABG in 1994 and underwent cath with additionally stenting in
2001. She had a recent MIBI ( 5/26 ) with nl EF and mild reversible
defects in peri-infarct territory. She had been doing well until
recently when she noted the onset of progressive dyspnea on exertion
over the last 2 months. She denies chest pain , cough , orthopnea. She
does report PND and new LE edema.
VS: 96.6 61 140/70 24 94 RA
PEx: Lungs: bilateral basilar crackles. CV: rrr , nl s1 and s2 , +s3 ,
II/VI SEM. Extr: bilateral edema over shins , non-pitting.
Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: The differential diagnosis for this patient&apos;s dyspnea
includes cardiac and pulmonary causes. Based on physical exam it was
not felt that she was in heart failure. However , with hx of CAD , this
was investigated with Echo which showd nl EF and heart function. The
Echo also showed nl RV fxn and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic PE and lung parechymal diseases were investigated with chest CT
which was negative for PE. It also showed moderate to severe
centrilobular emphysema with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. She
had PFTs the day of admission which showed decreased lung volumes all
consistent with a restrictive lung pattern. Given the diagnostic
dilemma , the Pulmonary service was consulted , which did not feel that
doe was due solely to pulm etiologies. Thus , desat is unexplained. Pt
will be sent home on o2 to be used during exertion only.
2. CV: The patient has a hx of hypertension and is being followed by
her Cardiologist Dr. Stouch . Per Dr. Hehr recommendation , her norvasc
was discontinued as was her atenolol. Desats could be
due to transient diastolic dysfunction w/ exertion. She has been
started on labetalol 400 bid at the time of discharge. Titrate up as BP
tolerates
3. PULM: will be d/c&apos;d on albuterol inh.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest Pain
History of Present Illness
Ms. Webre is a 75F who began HD one month ago , and presented 10 days
PTA with an NSTEMI ( Troponin 2.9 ) ( 70% LAD lesion which is s/p DES ). She
presents again with epigastric and sub-sternal burning sensation which
is similar , but more intense , to her anginal pain 10 days ago. Episodes
started 2 days prior to admission , occurring when lying down to go to
bed and last 1 hour ( spontaneously resolved , about a 2-3/10 ). Second
identical episode 1 day PTA. Neither associated with radiating pain ,
exertion , or DOE. Then had an episode while walking to PCPs office ,
associated with dyspnea and relieved with rest. Sent to ED , where
another episode occurred and was relieved with nitro. Received BB and
ASA in ED. Pt denies missing any plavix since DES placement , although
she does state plavix has caused her to have diarrhea. She denies any
radiating chest pain , F/C , weight change. + cough since starting
lisinopril , orthopnea ( unchanged from baseline ).

fraction is 45-50%. There is septal an inferior hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE
The patient was admitted to cardiac telemetry for atypical chest pain in
the setting of an NSTEMI and stent placement one week prior to this
admission. The pt reports having taken her plavix regularly , and having
not missed a single dose. She had no EKG changes , but did have burning
substernal chest pain at rest while lying down. Her cardiac enzymes
were flat ( troponin 0.21-0.23 in the setting of renal failure/HD ). This
pain was relieved by nitro SL. She was taken to cardiac catheterization
for further evaluation of her recent stent. No critical obstructions were
seen and the stent was widely patent. Her pain was relieved with PPI , and
she is discharged with a diagnosis of GERD. This pain is not felt to be
cardiac in origin.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
See Dr. Kastner as scheduled.
Take your medications as prescribed. Take Plavix regularly and DO NOT
MISS A DOSE.
If you have the burning chest pain again , you may take mylanta or
pepto-bismol ( or equivalent product ). Take your aciphex daily.

Discharge Date: 1/3/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 39 year old Wark Na Bo
female with a history of discoid lupus
and pericarditis , who presents with severe substernal chest pain
after having prednisone and Plaquenil discontinued. She first
developed discoid lupus in 1983. She subsequently over the years
developed arthralgias of various joints , was treated with aspirin ,
Motrin and steroids. In 1985 , she developed pleuritic substernal
chest pain. She was diagnosed at Westten Hospital with pericarditis
and underwent pericardiocentesis. In 1988 , she was seen at the
Arthritis Clinic by Dr. Goerlitz , who noted a discoid lupus on
examination , a mild anemia , sedimentation rate 85 , CH-50 178 , VNA
positive at 1:160 , positive anti-double-stranded DNA and 3+
positive Smith/anti-Smith antibody. She was treated with Plaquenil
200 bid , plus aspirin and Naprosyn. In 5 of October , she was diagnosed
with a lupus flare and was put on prednisone 30 q am. She did well
and in 24 of October the steroids were tapered off and discontinued.
However , she presented with substernal chest pain at that time and
had her prednisone restarted. She was put on another prednisone
taper. In 23 of March , she had a negative brain magnetic resonance
imaging. In 21 of April , she had an echocardiogram which showed
pericardial thickening without evidence of constriction consistent
with prior pericarditis. Over the following several months , she
had occasional flares because of medical noncompliance. She was
put on Plaquenil 200 bid , which was increased to tid , and Motrin
800 bid. In 2 of January , she again came to the emergency room with
substernal chest pain and a mild pulsus paradoxus , no jugular
venous distention. An electrocardiogram was without change. Chest
x-ray showed slight increase in the heart size. She was placed on
prednisone 30 q day , Tylenol with codeine and did well. On
16 of October , she was seen in the clinic and had substernal chest pain
consistent with pericardial pain , dyspnea on exertion , increased
arthralgias secondary to discontinuing her steroids. At that time ,
she had her Plaquenil and prednisone restarted. Over the last 3
weeks prior to admission she noticed that the prednisone and
Plaquenil increased stomachaches and she stopped the medication.
Over the last 7 days prior to admission , she has had increasing
dyspnea on exertion and substernal chest pain , which is sharp ,
increases with cough or deep breaths. She denied any orthopnea or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations or syncope. She has no
nausea , vomiting , fevers , chills or melena. She does have
increasing joint pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed seizure
disorder with Dilantin , hypothyroidism treated with L-thyroxine ,
iron deficiency anemia without prior work-up , thoracic spine
compression fractures , gastritis questionably secondary to
Naprosyn. She has no known ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION
were Plaquenil 200 bid , Motrin 80 tid , prednisone 10 q am , Dilantin
400 q am , L-thyroxine 0.2 q day , folate 1 mg po q day , iron sulfate
225 tid , Diprosone Ointment bid. She does not smoke or drink.
FAMILY HISTORY is negative for collagen vascular diseases. She is
the mother of 5 children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was an obese Hispanic female in mild
distress. Temperature was 99 , pulse 60 ,
blood pressure 130/70 , respirations 18 , pulsus paradoxus of 10.
Skin showed numerous discoid lesions of the scalp , face and right
forearm and lower extremities with patchy alopecia. Head , eyes ,
ears , nose and throat examination was unremarkable. Neck was
supple , no adenopathy noted. Chest was clear. Cardiac examination
showed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , with a I/VI systolic
ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border , otherwise no rubs
or gallops. Back showed no costovertebral angle or spinal
tenderness. Abdominal examination was benign , liver is 10 cm , and
the spleen tip is not palpable. Rectal examination was guaiac
negative , soft brown stools. She does have external hemorrhoids.
Extremities were negative without cords or Homan&apos;s sign. Neurologic
examination was grossly intact , with normal cranial nerve function ,
motor , sensory , coordination and deep tendon reflexes , except for
question of slight slowing of the relaxation phase of the reflexes
in the upper and lower extremities. Musculoskeletal examination
showed diffuse bilateral asymmetric synovial thickening with
slightly decreased range of motion most notably in the right elbow ,
right metacarpophalangeal joint , left carpal , bilateral knees and
ankles.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrolytes were all within normal
limits. Her CK was 76. Dilantin level
5.6. White count was 4.7 , hematocrit 30 , platelets 352 , 000 , mean
corpuscular volume 83 , ESR 88 , oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
Urinalysis showed specific gravity 1.026 , 2+ protein , 10 to 15
white cells , 8 to 10 red blood cells and a few granular casts.
Chest x-ray showed increased heart size , otherwise negative , no
change from 2 of January .  She does have multiple thoracic compression
fractures and osteopenia. The electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate
of approximately 70 , positive 45 degree axis , normal intervals ,
T-wave inversion in III and V2 through V3 without changes in the PR
or ST segments compared with 2 of January , and no decrease in the
voltages.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 was substernal chest pain. This
seemed to be a pericardial pain secondary to
discontinuation of her prednisone and Plaquenil as it happened
numerous times in the past. She was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She had an echocardiogram which showed a small amount
of pericardial fluid without evidence of right ventricular
indentation or compromise. She was placed back on her Plaquenil
200 bid , and prednisone 30 q day and did well in that regard.
Problem #2 was decreased hematocrit. This was felt to be probably
secondary to hydration as the hematocrit on hospital day #2 went
from 31 to 27 with several liters of intravenous fluid. Stool
guaiacs were negative throughout the hospitalization. The
hematocrit remained stable between 27 and 30 without transfusions
or further intervention. She did have a Coombs test sent which was
mildly positive , although her hematocrit was stable. She was
discharged on folate and iron. Problem #3 is hematuria and pyuria
at the time of admission. Urine culture and urine gram stain were
both negative for infection and this was followed up with a 24-hour
urine collection for protein to assess for potential lupus
involvement of the kidney , and this will need to be followed up on.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for FOLLOW-UP in
Rheumatology Clinic with Dr. Grondin . MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE included Plaquenil 200 bid , prednisone 20 q day ,
Dilantin 400 q day , L-thyroxine 0.2 q am , Motrin 800 tid , Carafate ,
iron and folate.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 36-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes ,
chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis as well as chronic
skin ulcers who was at hemodialysis on the day of admission when
she developed fevers to 101 , chills , and rigors. The patient
also developed diffuse abdominal pain on the afternoon of
admission and was referred for evaluation. The patient on
questioning reports that she was in her usual state of health
until 2 days prior to admission when she began to have abdominal
cramping with one episode of diarrhea as well as chills. While
she was at hemodialysis on the day of admission , the patient
became febrile with concern for infection and was referred for
evaluation at the Emergency Department.

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs: Temperature
103.3 , heart rate 92 , blood pressure 200/95 , respiratory rate of
20 , and 96% on room air. General: The patient is a black woman
with multiple skin ulcers notably over her trunk. Pupils were
equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular muscles were intact. She does have horizontal
nystagmus , sclerae are anicteric , JVP was flat. Chest: Faint
right basilar crackles. Cardiovascular: S1 , S2 normal , II/VI
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Carotids 2+
without bruit. Abdomen: Decreased bowel sounds , obese , slightly

with 4 bands. Hematocrit 30.3 , platelets 525. Normal liver
function test , lipase 29 normal. Urine hCG negative. INR 1.6.
Urinalysis was slightly positive.
STUDIES: Chest x-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette
concerning for pericardial effusion and bibasilar subsegmental
atelectasis. Left foot x-ray showed evidence of osteomyelitis of
the left calcaneus. Abdominal CT showed diffuse retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy , pulmonary nodules in the left lower lobe as well
as a low attenuation foci associated with a small bowel of
unclear significance. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats
per minute , normal axis with isolated T-wave inversion in V1.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
1. Status post wound debridement left heel 4/10/06 by Dr.
Ira Pollart , vascular surgery.
2. Status post hemodialysis tunneled catheter placement left
chest 1/27/06 by interventional radiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious disease: Line sepsis. The patient was treated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics and initially treated with
vancomycin , ceftazidime , and clindamycin as well as gentamicin.
She underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram that was negative
for valvular vegetation and she showed no stigmata of
endocarditis. She had blood cultures from 8/17/2006 that were
positive for vancomycin resistant enterococcus and her antibiotic
regimen was changed to linezolid and clindamycin to cover for
anaerobes in her left heel. The patient&apos;s tunneled hemodialysis
catheter was removed on hospital day #2 in the setting of line
sepsis. The patient remained afebrile and will complete a 21-day
course of linezolid for VRE line sepsis. Repeat blood cultures show no growth
to date. The patient
was also admitted with chronic left heel osteomyelitis. The patient had
plain films that showed evidence of osteomyelitis. The Vascular
Surgery Service was consulted and the patient underwent
debridement of her left heel on 4/10/06 by Dr. Angeloni and Dr.
Kalan . The patient will most likely need a left below-the-knee amputation
in the future most. The patient&apos;s wound culture grew out
Morganella morganii. However , in discussion with the Medical
team , the patient was not treated with antibiotic coverage for
this positive wound culture. A vacuum dressing was temporarily
placed to her wound and currently the wound is being treated with
t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings. The patient did have a chest x-ray
that could have been compatible with an early left lower lobe
pneumonia , and had some low grade fevers during this admission. The patient
will also be discharged on a 10 day course of renally dosed Levaquin to cover
for possible community acquired pneumonia. The patient also had abdominal
pain and fevers on admission and had an abdominal CT scan without evidence of
abdominal abscess or other intraabdominal acute process.
2. Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease , on
hemodialysis. She had her hemodialysis catheter removal. She
had negative blood cultures from 5/16/06 and the Interventional
Radiology Service placed another left chest tunneled hemodialysis
catheter on 1/27/06 .  The patient was started on Nephrocaps ,
PhosLo as well as Plavix during this admission.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had an admission chest x-ray
with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. She underwent a
transthoracic echocardiogram that revealed an EF of 55% and
trivial pericardial effusion. She showed no signs of cardiac
tamponade. The patient was continued on low-dose beta-blockade
and her lisinopril was restarted during the admission. She did
have periods of hypertension during the admission , thought to be
in the setting of volume overload. This did improve with
up-titration of her beta-blocker and hemodialysis. She will be
discharged on lisinopril as well as Toprol-XL. She was monitored
on telemetry throughout the admission.
4. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient tolerated a
renal fluid restricted diet. She did have hyperkalemia of 6.3
during the admission , which was treated appropriately. The
patient&apos;s hyperkalemia did improve with hemodialysis. The
patient did have difficult peripheral IV access during the
admission. However , she did refuse a central line.
5. Neurology: The patient has a seizure disorder and was
continued on Keppra.
6. Endocrine: The patient upon admission had elevation of her
blood sugars to more than 500. The patient was placed on an
insulin drip , which was titrated off on hospital day #2.
Subsequently , on hospital day #2 , the patient did have periods of
hypoglycemia for which she received amps of D50. The patient&apos;s
insulin regimen was adjusted during the admission. Initially ,
she was started on NPH 25 once in the evening and NPH 12 units
once every morning. In addition , regular insulin 6 units before
each meal was added. However , the patient again had periods of
hypoglycemia overnight on 1/27/06 and her insulin regimen was
changed to NPH 12 units subcu b.i.d. with a NovoLog sliding
scale. However , she continued to have periods of hypoglycemia. SHe will be
discharged on NPH 8 units sc qam and qac and qhs coverage with a humalog
sliding scale. She will
be discharged on this regimen and should followup at Bois Tham General Hospital .
7. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots.
8. Hematology: The patient&apos;s hematocrit was at baseline and
stable. The patient did have retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
seen on abdominal CT scan. This will need to be worked up as an
outpatient. This may represent inflammatory changes in the
setting of line sepsis and osteomyelitis however , malignancy will
need to be excluded.
9. Pulmonary: The patient had pulmonary nodules seen on
abdominal CT scan and will need an outpatient follow-up chest CT
to further evaluate these lesions.
10. GI: The patient had a low-attenuation area seen within the
small bowel on CT scan. In discussion with Radiology , we felt
that further imaging as an outpatient could be considered in the
form of either CT enterography or small-bowel follow-through.
They did not feel that this area represented an area of acute
pathology.
11. Wound care: The patient requires t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing
changes for her left heel. She will need to follow up with
Vascular Surgery in one week at either Ow Community Hospitals , depending on the patient&apos;s preference. She
should also have dry sterile dressings placed once daily to her
multiple open dermal ulcers that are chronic.
DISPOSITION: Full code. The patient will have homeVNA services.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: The patient will need to follow up with
either Vascular Surgery at Tho Medical Center or with Vascular
Surgery , Dr. Sehr at 317-001-4753 at Rohall Health in one week. The patient will need to follow up with
Dr. Cedrick Packingham , 829-459-7212 at Eewood Alum Lopela Community Hospital
Nephrology Department after she is discharged from
rehabilitation. The patient should also follow up with Dr.
??__?? at Boxsan Hospital in two to four weeks. Upon discharge
from rehab , the patient will undergo hemodialysis at Oview Cooau Medical Center , 430-609-4274 in Ale E Fre La Ankrance on
Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
69 yo female with NIDDM , HTN , obese , former smoker admit two weeks ago
after discharge for positive stress test. In October , during
dobutamine part of MIBI pt had severe SOB with desat to 60s , ruled in
for NQWMI , refused cardiac cath or further evaluation. Pt now
readmitted with several days of nausea-like epigastric sensation
following meals , esp fatty/caffeine meals , decreased PO intake , then
on day PTA with profound nausea , diaphoresis and SOB while ambulating.
EXTREMELY difficult by history to differentiate cardiac vs GI etiology.
On examination only tachycardic , no signs failure. Plan was to treat
as cardiac disease , and evaluate for GI cause. Pt&apos;s lopressor was dose
adjusted for tachycarida , continued on ASA , ACE , nitrates. Pt not
anticoagulated. Cardiology consult felt new symptoms were GI and did
not recommend in-house cardiac catherization. Pt was started on
increased dose of prilosec for presumed gastritis with no evidence of
GIB by hct and heme negative stools. Presumed cause was home asa and
prednisone use. Pt will consider outpatient cardiac catherization and
intervention. She is scheduled to see Dr. Kallam in 2 weeks and Dr.
Drissel promptly after that.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your physician with any chest pain that is new , different
in quality , or if accompanied by shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting.
Please record the timing and nature of your symptoms if you continue to
have them. Also please record what makes them come and what makes them
go away.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man who
was morbidly obese and presented with
dyspnea , pedal edema , and chest discomfort. At baseline , the
patient was unable to walk from room to room at home without
becoming dyspneic. He used a BiPAP with pressure support of 15 and
PEEP of 10 on room air at night. Over the past two weeks , however ,
the patient had noted gradually worsening dyspnea with minimal
exertion now such as just turning over or sometimes even at rest.
Concomitantly , patient had noted , initially , left calf and ankle
swelling approximately one week ago that improved after several
days then right calf and ankle swelling and tenderness which still
persisted. He also noted upper respiratory symptoms with
intermittent dry cough , sinus pain , and congestion over the past
week. He denied fever or chills. He had experienced intermittent
chest spasm which he distinguished from cardiac pain. This pain
felt like spasms generally experienced in his arms. The patient
had experienced no constipation but had intermittent diarrhea which
was then thought to be secondary to colchicine therapy. The
patient presented to the Emergency Department for further work-up.

hypertension , cardiomegaly , gout , asthma ,
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately
1.6 , depression , thrombophlebitis , and alcohol abuse.

4.2 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 24 ,
creatinine 1.8 , glucose 91 , AST 14 , alkaline phosphatase 52 ,
albumin 4.1 , calcium 8.5 , CK 311 , MB 1.5 , troponin I 0.3 , white
blood cell count 8.6 with polys 695 , lymphocytes 21 , monocytes 8 ,
and eosinophils 1 , hematocrit 40.9 , platelets 200 , PT 13.4 , and PTT
25.0. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 74 with intervals
0.22/0.14/0.45 , axis minus 38 degrees , left atrial enlargement ,
intraventricular conduction defect , T wave inversion in II , III ,
and V6 , and no change since 3/11 .  Chest x-ray showed low lung
volumes and VQ scan showed high probability for pulmonary embolism
in let lower lobe , left upper lobe , and right upper lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 57 year old morbidly obese man with
extensive past medical history now admitted with
progressive dyspnea over the past two weeks and studies showing
pulmonary embolism. The patient was started on intravenous
Heparin. The dose of Heparin was increased until his PTT was in
the range of 60 to 80 seconds. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin
was initiated at 15 mg each night. After three nights of therapy ,
the patient&apos;s INR was 1.4 so his dose was increased to 20 mg per
night. After two nights of this therapy , his INR started to rise
to 2.3 and his dose was decreased to 15 mg. His INR the next
morning was 2.6. Intravenous Heparin therapy was discontinued.
The patient also had right ankle pain and erythema that was
consistent with a flare of gout. His dose of colchicine was
increased from 0.6 mg b.i.d. to t.i.d. Allopurinol was also
started for uric acid levels of 7.9. The patient had symptoms of
sinusitis likely from his use of BiPAP at home. He was started on
trimethoprim/sulfamoxole double-strength twice a day. Physical
therapy was initiated. The patient was able to transfer himself
from bed to chair and was able to ambulate approximately sixty feet
with minimal dyspnea. An extra-wide heavy duty rolling walker was
obtained to help the patient maintain his balance.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with VNA services.
A nurse will draw his blood tests for INR testing. A
home safety evaluation will also be performed.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Warfarin 15 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Albuterol two
puffs inhaled t.i.d. with spacer ,

HOSPITAL COURSE: SOB secondary to CHF exacerbation and fluid overload. No
evidence of infectious pulmonary process contributing to present
symptoms. CXR and CT changes are c/w scarring/changes from recent
multifocal PNA 9/8 , with additional ground glass c/w pulmonary edema.
No clinical or radiologic e/o primary lung etiology for DOE. Pulmonary
team assessed patient and reviewed non contrast chest CT from this
admssion - they confirmed that current sx are likely 2/2 pulomonary
edema. Patient was diuresed with Lasix just over 3L net negative with
improvement in his oxygen saturations ( rest and ambulation ). At time of
d/c JVP 10cm. Pt will diurese further at home on Lasix 80 BID ( he had
not been taking his lasix for 2d prior to d/c. HTN was
another issue on admission but is most likely due to patient taking wrong
dose of Coreg ( taking QOD instead of BID ). On a BID Coreg regiments , BP
much better controlled. Etiology of his CMP still remains unclear despite
extensive outpt W/U. Additionally , discrepancy between Echo and
Cardiac MRI is puzzling. No concern for ischemia on this admission ,
clean cath in 2002. Started on ASA and continued on Lipitor. Renal function
remained stable but impaired. He is being evaluated for dialysis as an
outpatient but no vasc access placed yet. Phoslo , nephrocaps continued
here. Finally , pt continued on coumadin for h/o recent DVT ( 9/8 ) and INR
remained in therapeutic range. Low suspicion for PE on this admission. He
was discharged in stable condition with outpatient follow up instructions..
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Be sure to take your Coreg as instructed.
2. Call your doctor if your shortness of breath gets worse or if you have
chest pain , fevers or dizziness.
3. Take your coumadin as regulated by the anticoagulation
clinic.
4. Check your weight daily and take your lasix as prescribed.
5. Call you primary care doctor and cardiologist Monday morning 9/7 .
Please see one of them this upcoming week.

DATE OF DISCHARGE:
To be determined.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 62-year-old male with morbid obesity , hypertension , chronic
renal insufficiency , prior MI presents with increased lower
extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion over the last several
months. Some of this has been attributed to volume overload and
the patient has had an increased creatinine from approximately in
early February of this year to 5.5 in September .  The patient had
previously refused dialysis , but agreed a few weeks ago to begin
the process of dialysis and was scheduled for a fistula
evaluation next week. However , in the past few days , his dyspnea
on exertion has accelerated. Whereas , he used to be able to walk
40 to 50 feet without shortness of breath , he is now only able to
walk 10 feet. Therefore , he is presenting to the emergency
department. In the emergency department , he got his home CPAP ,
was noted on chest x-ray ( of poor quality ) to have a question of
a left lower lobe consolidation and therefore received one dose
of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. His BNP was elevated to 1663
( from 655 one year ago ) and his creatinine rose to 5.9 from 5.5
in September and 4.1 in February .  Therefore the patient was felt to
have also an element of volume overload and he was admitted to
the renal service for consideration of dialysis and volume
removal.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes type II.
3. Morbid obesity.
4. Sleep apnea.
5. Chronic hydronephrosis.
6. FSGS ( focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ).
7. Status post chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
8. BPH.
9. Prior MI ( was not able to cath due to body habitus ).
10. Hypercholesterolemia.
11. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 4.1 ).

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Pulse 92 , blood pressure 160/70 , respirations 18 , 95% on room
air. The patient is wearing his CPAP. He is falling asleep
during the interview. He is in no apparent distress. Heart is
regular rate and rhythm. Heart sounds are distant , but S1 , S2
are heard. There is no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. JVP cannot be
determined. The patient has crackles at the right base. Abdomen
is markedly obese with significant lateral edema particularly on
the left side where his pannus tends to fall. There is
significant scrotal edema. The scrotum appears to be about 7
inches in diameter. The patient has bilateral 3+ pitting leg
edema. He has 2+ DP pulses bilaterally. He has closed ulcers on
his abdomen which he states that have been there for several
years and that he tends to pick at them daily to make them bleed.
LABORATORY EXAM:
Sodium 145 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 107 , bicarb 21 , BUN 68 ,
creatinine 5.9 , glucose 53 , lipase 11 , total bili 1.0 , alk phos
153 , BNP 1663 , calcium 7.8 , phosphate 7.3 , magnesium 1.8 ,
troponin less than assay , white blood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit
33.3 , platelets 144 , 000 , INR 1.3 , BNP was 1663.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacification , but the patient
was not able to stand for a lateral chest x-ray.
EKG showed first-degree AV block with poor R wave progression and
a question of Q waves in 3 and AVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: The patient was felt to be in volume overload. His
chronic renal insufficiency was progressing likely for several
reasons including his chronic hydronephrosis. his focal segmental
glomerular sclerosis , diabetes , and hypertension. He was
initially given large amounts of Lasix but he failed to diurese
significantly and his creatinine rose to approximately 7.0.
Therefore , a tunneled catheter was placed by vascular surgery and
the patient began urinalysis with the purpose of taking out of
volume. Approximately 20 liters of volume were taken off over
several days of dialysis. The patient will continue hemodialysis
three times a week as an outpatient. In addition , he had venous
ultrasound mapping for likely placement of a permanent AV
fistula.
2. Pulmonary: The patient continued to wear his CPAP for his
severe obstructive sleep apnea. His breathing improved somewhat
during his hospitalization but it was not possible to tell how
well he would do if he would attempt to walk again as he was
sedentary and in bed for his entire hospitalization except for
occasionally sitting up on the side of the bed and moving to a
bed chair once or twice.
3. Infectious Disease: There was not clear evidence of pneumonia
critically or on review of the chest x-ray and therefore the
patient was not specifically treated for pneumonia. However ,
upon placement of a Foley catheter , there was a significant
amount of white blood cells in the urine and while the urine
culture appeared not to be negative , the patient was treated with
a 10-day course of levofloxacin ( renally adjusted ) for urinary
tract infection. Foley catheter was initially placed by urology.
Due to difficulties in the anatomy , it may get hard to place.
Once Foley catheter was removed , the patient was able to urinate
on his own.
4. Cardiovascular:
A. Rhythm: The patient was maintained on sotalol and a
beta-blocker for his prior history of ventricular tachycardia.
He did not have any episodes while inhouse on this
hospitalization. The patient&apos;s electrophysiologist Dr. Marc C Gouin suggested that given that the patient is on hemodialysis ,
the sotalol should be reduced to 40 mg three times a week to be
given approximately two hours after dialysis. The plan was to
monitor the QT interval and discontinue sotalol as a QT interval
or if the QTC were greater than 500 msecs. A QTC was monitored
during this hospitalization and never exceeded 500 msecs.
Therefore , the sotalol should be continued at this dose on
dialysis days.
B. Ischemia: He is much ruled out for MI. He was maintained on
aspirin , statin , and a beta-blocker.
C. Pump: The patient was volume overloaded on admission and
improved after significant volume reduction by hemodialysis. A
review of the patient&apos;s prior cardiac echoes showed that in
9/30 he had an ejection fraction of approximately 70%. In
2/19 , his ejection fraction fell to about 45 to 50%. On
repeat echocardiogram during this admission , a repeat
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of about 30 to 35%
with a mildly dilated left ventricle , moderately reduced left
ventricular function. Akinesis in the entire apex of the basal
septum segment and the basal posterior segment of the heart and
hypokinesis in the anterior wall , the anterior lateral wall , the
inferior wall , and the mid anterior septum segment. There is
mild mitral regurgitation. No tricuspid regurgitation and trace
aortic regurgitation without any significant evidence of aortic
stenosis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. PhosLo 1334 mg p.o. t.i.d. , instructions to give with meals.
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.

TO DO:
The patient will receive hemodialysis three times a week on
Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ezra Ozuna as an outpatient
within three or four weeks.
The QTC intervals should be monitored every week while at rehab
or at a regular doctor&apos;s appointment as an outpatient to ensure
that it is less than 500. If it is greater than 500 , then the
frequency of sotalol administration should be decreased in order
to maintain a QTC of less than 500 msecs.

Discharge Date: 10/10/1992
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 37 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy admitted
with positional chest pain associated with viral prodrome. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy in 10-89. She was worked up at the Ingvid&apos;s Health Services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
work-up unavailable. The patient was discharged on Lasix , digoxin
and an ACE inhibitor. In 15 of April , the patient was admitted to Orecross Medical Center after complaining of positional chest pain ,
shortness of breath and fatigue. She was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed large
ventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. In
23 of June , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test and
endured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. Peak heart
rate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrial
premature beats and no ischemic ST-T changes. Her oxygen uptake
was 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. In 24 of November , the patient
underwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%
and global hypokinesis. On the day of admission , on 11 of January , the
patient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and
malaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest below
the left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lying
on the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on the
right , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also with
ventral palpation. The patient claimed that the pain had never
gone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certain
positions. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for
cardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuser
for 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION included Lasix , Enalapril and digoxin. ALLERGIES were no
known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese black woman in no
apparent distress. Blood pressure was
162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,
no pulsus. Eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,
extraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. Neck was supple ,
jugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+
bilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion
except for a few bibasilar crackles. Heart showed normal S1 and
S2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. Abdomen
was obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was comfortable with deep
palpation diffusely. Extremities showed no edema. Rectal
examination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium was 137 , potassium 2.7 , chloride
92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,
creatinine .9 , glucose 159 , AST 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,
with 23% myocardial bands. White count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,
platelets 166 , 000 , ESR 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partial
thromboplastin time 18. Chest x-ray showed a big heart with mild
congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave
inversions in I , II , F , L , V2 through V6 , consistent with a 1990
electrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chest
pain similar to the chest pain she is having now.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the thought that
her history was consistent with pericarditis , but
was also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatinine
phosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her history
of cocaine abuse. Her hospital course was consistent with
continuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalization
despite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. It was found that
hermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial band
fraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift our
therapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control her
pericarditis. At that time , Indocin was started and the chest pain
resolved. With the resolution of her chest pain , the T-wave
inversions corrected. The patient was transerred to the floor on
Indocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , Bactrim , Enalapril
and Carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.
She was also seen by the ACE team in consultation about her drug
and alcohol problem , and it was decided that she would be
discharged on 21 of January , after arrangement for follow-up with the ACE
team.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE included aspirin , Indocin 50 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Enalapril 10 milligrams by mouth each day ,
Carafate 1 gram by mouth 4 times a day. The patient is to
FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Dewitt A. Sisler .

Discharge Date: 1/4/2005
ATTENDING: LUIGI ILLAS MD
SERVICE: This patient received care at the Vascular Surgery
Service.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Status post open abdominal aortic aneurysm
( AAA ) repair.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old male
with a history of morbid obesity , sleep apnea , CAD status post
CABG x 4 in 2001 , who presented with vague abdominal pain and was
found by CT scan to have a 6-cm infrarenal AAA. The patient was
initially prepared for a repair in outside hospital that upon
review of the aneurysm extended up to include of the origin of at
least to the left renal artery and this was felt to be a
suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm requiring a retroperitoneal
approach. He presents now for surgery.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin leading to a rash.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD status post CABG x 4 in 2001 ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , gout , GERD , morbid obesity ,
status post silent MI in 1980 and 1985 , Meniere&apos;s syndrome in
left ear , sleep apnea leading to BiPAP use.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post CABG x 4 in 2001 , status post
laparoscopic cholecystectomy , 2004 , and status post left knee
arthroscopy.
PREVIOUS STUDIES: PFTs showing an FVC of 3.44 ( 80% predicted ) ,
FEV1 of 2.40 ( 83% predicted ) , and an FEV1/FVC of 70 ( 104%
predicted ). The patient had an negative stress test on 7/23/01
and 6/20/01 and a MIBI , 6/20/01 showing concentric LVH with an
EF of approximately 48% , wall motion abnormalities of the septum
consistent with cardiac surgery , no perfusion abnormalities and
minimal reversible ischemia at the base of the lateral wall with
the volume affected being small.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 71-year-old male with a
history of morbid obesity , sleep apnea , CAD status post CABG x 4 ,
presenting with abdominal pain and found by CT scan to have 6-cm
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was taken to the
operating room on 6/28/05 where he underwent an uncomplicated
open repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm through a
retroperitoneal flank approach. The patient tolerated the
procedure well. He left the operating room with an epidural ,
Foley , and nasogastric tube to low wall suction. He was admitted
overnight to the intensive care unit for a close monitoring of
blood pressure. His blood pressure overnight remained good and
the patient had a negative set of enzymes on postop #0 with a CK
of 146 , MB of 1.7 , and troponin less than assay. The patient was
taken up to the surgical intensive care unit intubated. He
received 7800 units of crystalloid , 6 units of cell saver , and 2
units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively , put out 1200 cc
of urine , 175 cc out of the nasogastric tube , with an EBL of 2400
cc. He was weaned from the ventilator without difficulty on
postop day #1 and was extubated by the evening on postop day #1.
The patient was transferred to the floor. He was out of bed and
to chair on postop day #2 with nursing assistance. Diet was
advanced as tolerated to a low fat , low cholesterol diet. The
patient initially started on his home Celebrex and other
medications. The epidural was capped on postop day #2 , 10/3/05 .
It was removed on 10/5/05 and this is fully discontinued as
well on postop day #3 , 10/5/05 .  The patient&apos;s nasogastric tube
had been removed on the morning of postop day #1 as well.
The patient continued to do well on the floor. He was placed on
aspirin and subcutaneous heparin for anticoagulation. He was
Hep-Lock&apos;d on postop day #3 as he was taking good p.o. orally.
He was out of bed to chair multiple times during the day.
Physical Therapy saw the patient on postop days # 4 to #5 and
worked with some on his mobility. He , at home , gets out of bed
to a wheelchair and he was back to his preoperative functional
status with a small amount of fatigue on postop day #7 and #8.
The patient continues to work with Physical Therapy and to get
out of bed with nursing staff on a regular basis multiple times
per day.
Incision site remained clean , dry , and intact. On postop days #1
to #2 secondary to his large amount of edema , the patient has
large amount of drainage from his incision site on the flank.
However , this slowed down and the incision site remained clean ,
dry , and intact with the erythema. The patient continues to do
well. By postop days #7 to #8 , the patient was deemed stable for
discharge to rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr. Mevers
in clinic for staple removal in seven days.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Ms. Phetteplace is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant 1992 , s/p
PCI/Stent 6/19 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent placement 6/19 ,
h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid Stent Placement
10/24/06 .  During annual follow up in 9/30 of her heart transplant , a
complex eccentric 80% lesion was noted in the proximal LCx. She was
admitted in January electively with plans for cardiac cath/PCI/stent.
However in the interim period , she had a symptomatic LUE numbness thought
to be a TIA , concerning for R carotid stenosis.An MRI revealed bilateral
tight carotid stenosis. The LCx and Symptomatic R Carotid artery
underwent cath/stent placement in 6/19 .  However , intervention on her
left internal carotid artery ( though 90% occluded by cath ) was deferred
due to already receiving 2 angiographikc procedures during the 6/19
admission. At this time she was tapered off cell-cept and started on
rapamycin - in hopes of slowing progression in her coronary disease. She
then returned to medical attention on 19 of April for catheterization/stent
placement on Left Carotid Artery. During these procedure , a hematoma
developed at the L femoral access site which was managed with compression
during the case. FSBS was 384 prior to the procedure and elevated to 547
during the procedure ( she received D5W+HCO3 during the procedure. ) She
was given 10 u regular insulin x 2 and her FSBS declined to 400s. Her
post-procedure course has been complicated by hyperglycemia and hematoma
formation with a Hct drop of 30 ` 22.
PMH:

Hct&gt;28.
2. CV( Ischemia ): Patient h/o ischemic CM s/p heart transplant with
evidence of CAD on allograft. Patient medically managed with pravachol ,
aspirin and plavix. Now s/p bilateral carotid stents and stent to LCx.
Attempt to change immunosuppressive regiments to rapamycin in order to
lower progression of CAD however on this regiment , her cholesterol panel
has markedly worsened. Have stopped rapamycin ( 6/20 ) and restarting
cellcept and cyclosporine at prior doses. Will need review in clinic in
30 days with bilateral carotid ultrasounds.
CV( Pump ): Clinically appears euvolemic. On Toprol , restarting lasix at
home dose ( 5/13 ).
CV( Rhythm ): On telemetry , no events seen.
3. Endo: During hospitalization and prior/during procedures has had poor
glucose controls with FSBS in 300s-400s. Patient reports poor glycemic
control at home with FSBS in 300s. AM FSBS was 384 and received D5NS
prior to procedure , exacerbating hyperglycemia. Endocrinconsulted and
recommended Qday lantus injection with with Novolog sliding scale + AC
while in house. HbA1c @ 11 ( markedly worse than 6 in January ) - patient can
not identify other factors which have changed since January other than
immunosuppressants to rapamycin. FSBS were difficult to control in house
despite using 20 QDay of lantus , Ms. Nickodem FSBS continued to run in
the 200s-300s during the day. She was taught to inject herself with
insulin SC during her stay. She is discharged on Glyburide 10 QDay and
Lantus 20 QDay. She was taught to keep a diary and will follow up with her
PCP.
4. Neuro: TIA/CVA in 6/19 .  residual Left numbness/weakness in hand. On
plavix and asa , now s/p R and L Carotid Stents.
5. Immunosuppression: As above , have changed immunosuppression from
Rapamycin + Cyclosporine back to Cyclosporine 75 BID +Cellcept 1000 BID as
patient performed priorto 6/19 .
6. MSK/Rheum: The patient previously complained of myalgias with statins and
was resistant to starting statins because they seemed to worsen her
aches/pains. Rheumatology service was consulted. They believed her pain
is not consistent with statin associated myalgia. Zetia was stopped and
she was started on Pravachol 20 mg QHS.
Her back pain is relieved by leaning forward and she walks at Arkansas
with a shopping cart for exercise which is consistent with spinal stenosis.
They recommended physical therapy and MRI imaging of her back. The MRI
preliminary read shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and moderate
spinal stenosis at one level. Physical therapy saw her and thought she
would benefit from home PT in the future--she was given a prescription for
outpatient physical therapy.
Since she is on long term prednisone she should have a DEXA scan and may
benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Sabean is a 75-year-old gentleman with history of
insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia who had a history
of myocardial infarction and stent placement of his right
coronary artery in 4/3 .  The patient had two recent episodes
of dyspnea on exertion with mild activity which resolved
spontaneously. Cardiac catheterization was performed , which

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Sawka was brought to the operating room on 2/13/06 where he
underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with left
internal mammary artery to the first diagonal coronary artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal coronary
artery with a sequential graft and then saphenous vein graft
connecting from the right coronary artery to the first left
ventricular branch. Total bypass time was 127 minutes and total
circulatory arrest time was 11 minutes. Intraoperatively , the
patient&apos;s aorta was not clamped due to calcifications ,
appropriate locations for cannulation and proximals were
identified with epicardial echocardiogram. The patient was
cooled to 20 degrees. Distal anastomoses were done under
ventricular fibrillatory arrest with brief circulatory arrest.
Proximals were done under circulatory arrest. The patient did
well intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident. He was
brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and
stable condition. Postoperatively , the patient was initially
ventricularly paced , and started on dopamine which was discontinued
on 8/9/06 .  The
patient also had rate controlled atrial fibrillation that was
treated with Lopressor and
started on Coumadin for anticoagulation , he did convert to normal
sinus rhythm. He was extubated on 2/10/06 and he did have some
postoperative low urine output , which improved with his dopamine
and intravenous Lasix. Diabetes Service also followed the
patient throughout his postoperative course for his glucose
control. He was transferred to the
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #5. Mr. Corneluis also received
2 units of packed red blood cells postoperatively for
postoperative anemia. Mr. Ouellet was screened by physical
therapy for rehab and was cleared for discharge to rehabilitation
on 8/22/06 .  That morning , the patient complained of intense pain
in his feet , which was found to be from a gouty flare ,
rheumatology was consulted and they recommended a short course of
prednisone along with colchicine for approximately three weeks
and then to be restarted on allopurinol 100 mg after his
colchicine course is completed. The patient&apos;s pain and swelling did improve
overnight. He was reevaluated the following morning and
cleared for discharge to rehabilitation on November
on postoperative day #9.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with multiple medical problems
including CHF , coronary artery disease , type II diabetes who
presented to the Ochsantal Medical Center Emergency
Department on 5/28/06 , with subacute onset of shortness of
breath. He had been bedridden for several months with right heel
ulcerations , and was scheduled to undergo operative repair of
this ulceration , however , he began to feel short of breath one
day prior to admission. His O2 saturation was 70% on room air.
upon presentation. He also described dull nonradiating chest pain
with shortness of breath , which had resolved at the time the
patient arrived in the Emergency Department. He also had
increased right knee pain for one week , presumably due to a combination of gout
and OA. He was taking colchicine at that time as
well. By the time the patient had been seen in the Emergency
Department , his shortness of breath had improved significantly.

Cardiovascular: Irregular rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Abdomen: Nontender , no masses. Extremities: He has 2+ radial
pulses and his lower extremity pulses are not palpable. He has a
right foot dressing and is in a boot. Neurologically: His
cranial nerves are intact bilaterally. His upper extremity
strength is 5/5.
PERTINENT LABS UPON PRESENTATION:
K 3.7 , BUN 30 , creatinine 1.4 , and sugar 117. CBC 11.3 , 30.6 ,
and 421. INR 2.2. Cardiac enzymes: CK 21 , CK-MB 1.4 , troponin
less than assay. Digoxin level 1.1. UA normal.
IMAGING:

hypertrophy , AFib , digitalis changes.
ASSESSMENT:
An 80-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease ,
AFib , peripheral vascular disease , gout in the setting of CHF
exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medicine Service
where he was cared for until 1/15/06 .  During this time , the
patient&apos;s lasix was increased to 80 mg IV q.a.m. an attempt to
diurese the patient with a goal I/O of negative 1 liter a
day. He was continued on his digoxin and metoprolol. He was
ruled out for cardiac event with three negative sets of cardiac
enzymes. He was started on a bowel regimen of Colace , Senna and
MiraLax p.r.n. due to constipation. Regarding his right knee
pain , the Rheumatology Service was consulted on 7/10/06 and
recommended two views of his right knee , which were significant
for a small effusion and severe osteoarthritis. Recommended
Tylenol , opioids for pain and continued colchicine.
Intraarticular steroids were discussed , however , deferred until
after surgical intervention. A Foley catheter was placed to
monitor his I&apos;s and O&apos;s closely. He was also started on
tamsulosin for his BPH. Regarding his hematologic status , his
Coumadin was initially continued , however , due to a planned
Plastic Surgery intervention , starting on 7/10/06 .  The patient
did receive several doses of p.o. vitamin K preoperatively , which
brought his INR down to 1.3 prior to surgery. Thus on 1/15/06 ,
Mr. Rochat was taken to the operating room for debridement of his
right Achilles ulceration and split thickness skin graft.
Postoperatively , he was transferred to the Plastic Surgery
Service. On postop day #1 , the Rheumatology Service was again
consulted for persistent right knee pain. They elected at that
time to inject steroids intraarticularly. There was not enough
fluid for aspiration , however.
POSTOPERATIVE HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Neurologically: The patient tolerated p.r.n. Dilaudid. He was
continued on his doses of Neurontin and Zoloft.
Cardiovascularly: He has continued on digoxin and metoprolol for
rate control of his atrial fibrillation. He was also continued
on 80 mg daily of Lasix , which was decreased to 40 mg after
recommendations from the Medicine Service. The patient did have
an episode of bradycardia into the 30s on 5/12/06 , which was
believed to be secondary to excessive beta blockade. Thus his
Lopressor dose was decreased to 25 mg t.i.d.
Respiratory: The patient has been saturating well on room air
without pulmonary complaints.
GI: The patient has been tolerating his diet and having bowel
movements.
GU: The patient&apos;s Foley catheter was removed on 5/12/06 .  The
patient voided without complication. He has continued his
tamsulosin.
Hematologically: He was placed back on his home dose of Coumadin
and his aspirin was restarted. His hematocrit was stable
postoperatively at 27.8 and has continued to be stable and is
currently 29.4. He has also been maintained on subcutaneous
heparin t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis.
ID: The patient was started on clindamycin postoperatively for
graft prophylaxis. He has been afebrile and his white count has
been normal and is currently 7.8.
Endocrine: He has been maintained on Lantus and NovoLog before
meals and a NovoLog sliding scale , which have been titrated
according to his blood sugars. His insulin regimen is currently ,
Lantus 32 units daily , and NovoLog sliding scale , and NovoLog 4
units before meals.
Rheumatologically: The patient has been followed by the
Rheumatology Service for right knee gout. The intraarticular
steroid injection improved his pain minimally and thus the
Rheumatology Service is currently planning on injection of
Synvisc intraarticularly. The Rheumatology Service also
recommended a right knee MRI , which was obtained ( showed severe OA , gouty
changes ). Regarding his wound , his dressings were taken
down on 11/16/06 and his skin graft appeared to be taking well.
His donor site is clean , dry , and intact as well and he is
receiving heat lamp treatments daily. Regarding his mobility ,
the patient has been limited significantly due to his severe
right knee pain. The physical therapist will work with the
patient on 11/16/06 , which is the first day that his skin graft
dressings have been taken down.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
The patient is alert and oriented x3 in no apparent distress
while he is resting. When he attempts to move his right lower
extremity , he does complain of significant right knee pain.
Cardiovascular is irregularly irregular. His lungs are clear
superiorly and slightly decreased in the bases. His abdomen is
soft , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: His right leg
donor site is clean , dry , and intact with Xeroform in place. His
right lower extremity skin graft was taking well with Xeroform in
place. His right knee is swollen and tender to palpation. The
patient has pain with passive and active range of motion.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Acetaminophen 325 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. pain , clindamycin
600 mg IV , colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.

4h. p.r.n. pain , milk of magnesia 30 mL p.o. daily , and Maalox
1-2 tablets p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. upset stomach.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient should follow up with Dr. Mammoccio in one to two weeks.
He should also follow up with his primary care physician in one
to two weeks. The patient should have his INRs checked two to
three times per week with goal INR of 2-3 for treatment of AFib.
He should also have heat lamp treatment to his split thickness
skin graft donor site 20 minutes t.i.d. until the Xeroform falls
off. The split thickness skin graft site should be changed daily
with Xeroform and Kerlix dressing. The patient is currently
scheduled for an MRI while inpatient , however , if he does not
receive his MR while in house , he needs to have an outpatient MRI
scheduled. Please refer to the discharge summary for final
details including a final list of medications and the plans

Discharge Date: 10/20/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: Diabetes , asthma , smoking , GI bleeding of unknown
etiology , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old man with
coronary artery disease with risk
factors of diabetes , hypertension , cigarette smoking , and a report
of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has reported a history of
angina over the past several years which was well controlled by
nitroglycerin. In October of 1997 , he was able to exercise 3
minutes of the Bruce protocol with maximum heart rate of 79 and a
blood pressure of over 80 with no evidence of ischemia on EKG. An
echo at that time was also normal. About a month prior to
admission , the patient began experiencing progressive chest pain
which seemed related to exertion. He described the chest pain as
burning and radiating to his neck. The patient has a history of
gastroesophageal reflux , and was referred for EGD , but this test
was postponed until a further workup of the patient&apos;s chest pain.
At baseline he reports exercise-related chest pain everyday as well as
occasional chest pain at rest relieved by about 3-5 nitroglycerin. These
episodes are associated with diaphoresis , shortness of breath , but no nausea or
vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
gastritis , GERD , GI bleed in February of
1999 , nephrolithiasis , diabetes , history of atrial fibrillation ,
asthma , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Cardizem , Klonopin , aspirin , Prilosec ,
Paxil , nitroglycerin , p.r.n. , Azmacort ,
albuterol , Mevacor , iron , NPH.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 71 , blood pressure 107/53 ,
satting 97%on room air. Pertinent positive
include occasional bilateral wheezes on lung exam. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
NECK: No evidence of JVD and no carotid bruits. ABDOMEN: Benign.
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis , clubbing or edema , and dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally. RECTAL:
Significant for guaiac-positive dark brown stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Significant for hematocrit of 29.4 , with an
MCV of 78 , cardiac enzymes were negative on
admission.
EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70. No
significant ST or T wave abnormalities.
PROCEDURES: Cardiac catheterization status post right coronary
artery stent was performed during the patient&apos;s
hospital stay. No complications resulted from this procedure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular. On February , the patient had an exercise
treadmill test Bruce protocol. He exercised for 2 minutes and 30
seconds achieving a maximum heart rate of 104 with maximum blood
pressure of 130/90 , however , the test was terminated at low
exercise level for shortness of breath an leg fatigue. No EKG
changes were noted during this test. Since this test was nondiagnostic , the
patient was scheduled for a dobutamine MIBI. This test showed a significant
area of ischemia in the inferior and apical regions of the heart. An
echocardiogram performed also showed an area of hypokinesis in the inferior
region of the heart. Cardiac catheterization performed on February showed
100% occlusion of the LAD and 75% occlusion of the right coronary
artery with stent placement. Prior to stent placement , Mr. Niesborella
had two episodes of chest pain in the hospital which resolved with
nitroglycerin. He had no chest pain following stent placement. He also had
transient episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter.
2. Gastrointestinal. Mr. Tangerman was noted to guaiac positive on
admission. He also reported some symptoms consistent with
gastroesophageal reflux. While in inpatient , his Prilosec was
increased at 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. He was followed by GI while in
inpatient and it was recommended that he have a repeat EGD and
colonoscopy as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.

Discharge Date: 7/3/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: NEPHROTIC SYNDROME , PEDAL EDEMA.
PROBLEM LIST: 1. DIABETES MELLITUS.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. BIPOLAR DISORDER.
4. PANIC DISORDER.
5. RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
6. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
7. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old man with
a medical history as listed above who
presented with 3 weeks of worsening bilateral leg edema. The edema
started approximately 6 months ago and has worsened over the past 3
weeks. He has gained approximately 20 pounds since the summer. In
August he was seen by his primary care physician and found to be
fluid overloaded and started on Lasix. Unfortunately he has not
responded to even 180 mg p.o. Lasix q day. Concomitant with the
edema he has increased dyspnea on exertion for about 1 1/2 weeks.
His ability to exercise is limited by his dyspnea and he can only
climb one set of stairs compared to 2 sets about 6 months ago. He
does not have symptoms of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea. In April of 2002 his pulmonary function studies revealed
obstructive dysfunction and he was started on Combivent inhalers
with good response. He has had 2 episodes of chest pain in September of
2002 for which he was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction ,
at that time MIBI was negative. He denies any palpitations on this
admission. His last echocardiogram on September , 2002 showed an
ejection fraction of approximately 65-70% with mild concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy and trace mitral regurgitation. The
patient is homeless , unemployed and left the Alb S
several days prior to admission. He has lived with his friends
since then.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Blood pressure 180 systolic , jugular
venous pressure at approximately 8 cm.
He has a normal pulmonary exam as well as a normal cardiac exam.
He has evidence of bilateral pitting edema to his hip.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a urine showing 13 grams
of protein per day.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old gentleman with diastolic
dysfunction , congestive heart failure ,
nephrotic syndrome who has failed oral diuretics. In the hospital
he had evidence of nephrotic-range proteinuria. He had a negative BNP
suggesting the nephrotic syndrome to be the major cause of his shortness
of breath more than congestive heart failure. Venous insufficiency and
standing on his feet most days were also likely contributors to his pedal
edema. Of
note , this nephrotic syndrome is likely due to long standing diabetes induced
nephropathy.
1. Cardiology: The plan is to continue enteric coated aspirin 325
mg p.o. q day and continue with his Ace inhibitor. The patient was
diuresed aggressively in the hospital and by the time of discharge
he had been switched from Diltiazem and metoprolol over to labetalol 1200
mg b.i.d. He will need Torsemide for diuresis , currently 100 mg qd. The plan
will be for him to get daily weights and he will be followed by a
congestive heart failure nurse. His weight upon discharge is 129
kilograms.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no dyspnea or respiratory
distress on discharge. The plan is to continue with his outpatient
inhalers.
3. Diabetes: The patient has good control on Lantus insulin and
will continue that.
4. Peripheral: The patient was fitted for Jobst stockings which
he should wear to his knee and should be used daily. His edema was greatly
improved with stockings and adequate diuresis.
5. Hematology: The patient has relatively new onset normocytic or
macrocytic anemia which will require an outpatient work up.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day ,
Atrovent inhaler 1-2 puffs inhaled
q.i.d. , labetalol 1200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , torsemide 100 mg p.o. q day , Flovent 110 mcg inhaled
b.i.d. , Lamictal 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lantus 46 units subcutaneously
q.h.s. , Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q day , potassium chloride slow
release 10 mEq p.o. q day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: To the Ton Lake Sidenortha
He will need close follow-up of his pulse , blood pressure , weight ,
electrolytes , blood sugars , and medical compliance.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married , no alcohol , no smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission. Temperature 97.9 , pulse 111 ,
blood pressure 133/86 , room air sat 96
percent. General - No acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round
and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Jugular
venous distention 15 centimeters , no lymphadenopathy. Lungs
decreased breath sounds at base with bilaterally crackles on the
left a third of the way up. Cardiovascular - tachycardic , normal
S1S2. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities 3+ lower
extremity edema to the mid thigh. Venous stasis changes on the
shins. Neuro nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 103 , WBC 5.5 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets
37.6 , CK 113 , Troponin 1.03.
Chest x-ray - left-sided pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Alexander Chadwick Rucker was admitted for increasing
cough , left lower extremity edema for presumed
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Hospital course by systems:
1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in new onset
congestive heart failure. He was aggressively diuresed. It was
noted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacing
at a rate of approximately 110-120. An electrophysiology consult
was obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDI
from DDD. The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequently
spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm.
2 ) Pulmonary. The patient was noted to have a persistent pleural
effusion that was new since the patient&apos;s coronary artery bypass
graft one month previous. Although it was suspected that this was
likely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhaps
postoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear. A pulmonary
consult was obtained. The patient did undergo a
diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid. Analysis
of the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 ( serum total
protein 7.6 ) , LDH of 158 ( serum LDH 228 ) ,
glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0
bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red blood
cells. No PMNs were noted. Cytology was still pending at the time
of discharge. Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for an
exudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient&apos;s
recent aggressive diuresis. As fluid did not appear to be
inspected. A PPD with control was planted which was negative ,
however controls were also anergic. Sputum cultures were negative.
It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeat
thoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CT
could be performed. This was to be pursued as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 7/27/99 with a home
VNA and physical therapy services for vital signs
monitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services.
FOLLOWUP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ladika on 3/5/99
in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr.
Thayne , his outpatient cardiologist. He was also to be seen in
Coumadin clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d.; digoxin
0.125 mg q.d.; Lasix 80 mg q.d.; NPH
insulin 20 units q. a.m. , 10 units q. p.m.; Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.;

ATTENDING: MORRONE , NEAL LIONEL MD
DEATH SUMMARY
DATE OF DEATH:
5/23/06 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Zicherman was a 59-year-old who was admitted to Dalewan on 7/25/06 from an outside hospital with a
deteriorating ischemic cardiomyopathy. He had a myocardial infarction in 1996
and subsequently had coronary artery bypass grafting also in 1996 with
subsequent occlusion of two grafts. He had four previous stents in native
vessels , had a biventricular ICD placed in 2000 , and he also had a history of
hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
He was admitted with increasing signs and symptoms of heart failure and had
gone from class I failure to class IV over the 18 months prior to admission. He
was noted to have a BNP of 1600 and was being treated for pneumonia on
admission. He was initially evaluated for heart transplantation , but due to
clinical deterioration was considered for ventricular assist device. He
required inotropic support prior to surgery. There is no other surgical
history of note.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , also a history of mild polycythemia
and thrombocytopenia.
FAMILY / SOCIAL HISTORY:
Both parents had coronary artery bypass grafts. He had an
80-pack-year cigarette smoking history.
DRUG HISTORY:
At the time of assessment , he was receiving amiodarone 200 mg
three times a day , digoxin 0.125 mg once daily , aspirin 81 mg
once daily , heparin continuous infusion , Lasix continuous
infusion , dobutamine continuous infusion , milrinone continuous
infusion , spironolactone 25 mg once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Examination revealed a midline sternotomy , respiratory crackles
bilaterally and a pansystolic murmur.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 6/16/06 , he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed
complete occlusion of OM2 , proximal RCA , proximal LAD , 90%
occlusion of the D1 , 100% occlusion of the ramus , 100% occlusion
of OM1. His LIMA to LAD graft was patent. He had a complete
occlusion of vein graft to RCA , 50% occlusion of vein graft to
D2. He was also noted to have pulmonary hypertension with mean
PA pressure of 48 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
33. His cardiac output was 3.5 liters on dobutamine and
milrinone infusions. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction
of 15% , trivial AI , mild MR , moderate TR. EKG revealed atrial
flutter at a rate of 104. Chest x-ray was consistent with
congestive heart failure.
On 11/22/06 , he underwent reoperative insertion of a HeartMate left ventricular
assist device and tricuspid valvuloplasty. He was unable to tolerate
chest closure at the end of procedure as his central venous
pressure was high.
Postoperatively he was coagulopathic and inotrope and nitric oxide dependant.
On postoperative day #2 , some progress was made weaning inotropes and on
postoperative day #3 , he had a chest closure with a pericardial patch. He also
underwent exploratory laparotomy and sustained a VT arrest requiring
discontinuation of cardioversion. He continued to require nitric
oxide in view of high pulmonary vascular resistance. On 6/13/06 , he had a
further episodes of ventricular fibrillation and had multiple electrical
cardioversions and required amiodarone and epinephrine. Eventually , he
converted to AV paced rhythm. At this time , he required continued to require
significant inotropic support. He subsequently continued to have multiple
episodes of ventricular fibrillation which were converted with his AICD. At
this stage due to his ongoing hemodynamic instability , he was paralysed with
Nimbex , and his nitric oxide was increased for ongoing pulmonary hypertension.
He continued to be hemodynamically ustable. On postoperative day #5 ,
he developed cool and dusky extremities and was started on
bivalirudin although at this stage his HIT screen was negative. He also became
febrile with temperatures to 103. On postoperative days #6 , 7 and 8 , his PA
pressures slowly began to improve and some slow progress was made weaning his
epinephrine. At this stage , his bilirubin began to increase and he developed
some melanotic stool. He also developed renal failure and by
this stage , his creatinine increased to 2.9. By postoperative
day #9 , his Nimbex and fentanyl infusions were stopped. His PA
mean pressure had reduced to less than 30. He became febrile
fevers and developed some purulent discharge from the VAD driveline.
On postoperative day #12 , he underwent fluoroscopic placement of
a post-pyloric feeding tube and continued to spike temperatures.
His bilirubin continued to rise , and his ammonia level had also
risen. On postoperative day #14 , he continued to be unstable
with deteriorating liver function , ongoing renal failure ,
metabolic acidosis , ongoing fevers , hemodynamically instability
and episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He also had by this
stage developed irreversible loss of fingers and toes. Due to
his unrelenting and deteriorating multisystem organ failure , a
family meeting was held at which the poor prognosis was
discussed. The family elected to withdraw all support and on
5/23/06 , the AICD was switched off as was the ventilator and the
ventricular assist device and comfort measures were instituted.
Mr. Desilvo died at 7:30 p.m. on 5/23/06 from multiple organ
failure secondary to complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
placement of ventricular assist device.

ATTENDING: SAMMET , SHANNON AMOS MD
SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
For the beginning of this dictation , I am going to defer to a
pervious discharge summary dictation dictated by Dr. Antony D Tirino . Confirmation number is 719231. It was dictated on
3/18/05 , therefore this dictation will continue over the
hospital course starting on 10/28/05 , at which time , the patient
was transferred to the Step-Down Unit. We began weaning the
milrinone drip as well as titrating up on her diltiazem and
Neoral. The patient was seen by Speech and Swallow and her diet
was liberalized to thin liquids. She was restarted on her
diuresis. The patient began having positive blood cultures on
11/29/05 .  One out of two bottles from 8/23/05 grew out
Gram-positive cocci , but the patient remained afebrile and her
white blood cell count was trending down. Further blood cultures
were sent off. Central line was discontinued on 9/3/05 and tip
was sent for culture. Further blood cultures were negative but
the line tip grew out coag-negative Staph. Echocardiogram
results revealed an ejection fraction of 55% , mild mitral
regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
moderate pericardial effusion , without evidence of hemodynamic
compromise. The patient underwent a cardiac biopsy on 3/8/05 ,
which showed focal healing ischemic injury. Despite all negative
cultures , the patient continued on vancomycin , Bactrim ,
levofloxacin and Valcyte. Speech and Swallow then started
regular solids and thin liquid. Her medications continued to be
monitored by the Congestive Heart Failure Service. She did
become slightly hypertensive and they increased her diltiazem.
She continued on her antibiotics. There is a PICC line attempted
to be placed on 5/26/05 , however , they were unable to withdraw.
Therefore , they would return in the morning to attempt it again.
Upper extremity and LENIs were done , which was negative for clot ,
except for in the left cephalic. Congestive heart failure people
then suggested that maybe it would be best that the patient just
stayed in the hospital without getting a PICC line to complete
her course of antibiotics. She also was going to need a repeat
right heart catheterization and biopsy. Her antibiotic course
was finished on 6/12/05 .  Only other issue was that the patient
was seen by Ophthalmology and it was recommended that she will
need reading glasses when she is at home. Diabetes management
continued to follow the patient and congestive heart failure did
as well. She underwent a right heart catheterization as well as
biopsy on 11/16/05 , which demonstrated normal left and right
filling pressures. They were 6 and 14. The patient was found
suitable for discharge to home on 11/16/05 .  At the time of
discharge , Ms. Hawker looked great. Her temperature was 96 ,
heart rate was 96 sinus , blood pressure was 110/80. She was
satting 99% on room air. Her weight was even from preop.

ATTENDING: HICKAM , TOM SIMON MD
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Jason Vanwechel , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old gentleman with
history of COPD , CHF , and stage IV chronic renal insufficiency ,
who presented to the emergency room on 8/26/2005 with wheezing
and shortness of breath following a three-day prodrome of cough ,
congestion , and chills. In the emergency room , the patient was
noted to have a BNP of 519 and was initially treated with Lasix
in the emergency room , and was admitted at that point for
diagnosis of COPD exacerbation in the setting of an upper
respiratory infection in addition to mild congestive heart
failure. The patient was given oral glucocorticoids and frequent
bronchodilator therapy was initiated. However , the patient&apos;s
mental status began to rapidly decline. As he became more
somnolent , he was noted to have an ABG with a pH of 7.16. The
patient was then transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic
respiratory failure after failing an initial trial of BiPAP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , requiring at least two prior
intubations; congestive heart failure , previously thought to be
diastolic with an EF of 50%; diabetes , hypertension , history of
upper GI bleed in 5/20 secondary to an antral ulcer , pneumonia
in 7/20 left lower lobe nodule , which is stable on followup
CTs; chronic renal insufficiency , thought secondary to diabetes
and hypertension.

ALLERGIES: IBUPROFEN WITH WORSENING RENAL FAILURE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Temperature 100.6 , heart
rate 88 , respiratory rate 28 , blood pressure 158/90 , and
saturating 99% on 2 L nasal cannula. General: This is a
pleasant , mildly overweight African-American male visibly
wheezing and speaking in short phrases. HEENT: Pupils are
equal , round , and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear. Neck:
Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: Tachycardic. No
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. JVP was increased. Respiratory:
Crackles , bibasilar. Notable for diffuse wheezes. Minimal air
movement. Peak flow was measured at 200. Abdomen: Soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds are present.
Extremities: Mild clubbing and trace edema bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Notable for electrolyte panel
within normal limits. BUN of 52 , creatinine of 3.3 , and glucose
of 154. BNP was 317. Hemogram showed a white blood cell count
of 7.7 , hematocrit 40.6 , and platelets 219. MCV was low at 80.
Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema , no infiltrates. EKG
showed no acute changes from prior.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 65-year-old male with history of
COPD who is admitted for a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a
likely viral URI as well as some mild congestive heart failure
exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Pulmonary: As noted above , the
patient was noted to be having hypercarbic respiratory failure
with an ABG of 7.16/98/89 on 3 L nasal cannula. He was therefore
transferred to the MICU and at that time required intubation.
The patient&apos;s respiratory status improved and he was extubated on
11/5/2005 .  The patient was initially treated with Solu-Medrol ,
which was changed to prednisone on 4/20/2005 .  The patient was
noted to have thick tenacious secretions and there was concern
for possible pneumonia as an underlying flare for the patient&apos;s
COPD. Therefore , the patient was initiated on levofloxacin for a
14-day course. The patient had , upon presentation , been noted to
be mildly volume overloaded but this improved with diuresis prior
to his MICU stay. In the setting of the patient&apos;s intubation ,
his pH corrected slowly , but he was still noted to have markedly
elevated partial CO2 pressures. The patient was treated with
chest PT as well as Duonebs. Following extubation , the patient
was transferred to the floor and did well. Medications were
adjusted and he was continued on a prednisone taper , Spiriva ,
Advair 250/50 Diskus , supplemental oxygen , Duonebs , and albuterol
nebulizers as needed. The patient continued to improve , and on
9/3/2005 , he was able to ambulate on room air without dyspnea
or hypoxia. At this point , we suggest outpatient pulmonary
function tests to further evaluate the extent of the patient&apos;s
obstructive disease.
Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient underwent a negative rule
out MI upon admission. This was obtained due to the newly
decreased EF of 35 to 40% that was noted on echocardiogram upon
admission. The patient has not had any ischemic symptoms;
however , this marked decrease is concerning especially including
the inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis , which is new from
his prior echocardiogram. The patient was continued on aspirin ,
beta-blocker , and statin. An ACE inhibitor was reinitiated when
the patient&apos;s creatinine stabilized. The patient will likely
need further cardiac risk stratification as an outpatient to
include an outpatient stress test.
Pump: As mentioned , upon admission , the patient was noted to
have mild volume overload. He has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a prior echocardiogram showing an EF of 50%. As
noted , the most recent echocardiogram obtained during this
hospitalization shows an EF of 35% with diffuse global
hypokinesis and inferior posterior wall akinesis. There was mild
decreased function of the RV as well , and mild left atrial
enlargement and mild right atrial enlargement. The patient is
noted to have relatively stable pulmonary hypertension with a PA
pressure of 50 plus right atrial pressure.
The patient had been diuresed aggressively in the emergency room
and therefore did not require additional diuresis upon transfer
to the MICU. The patient was initiated on hydralazine and
Isordil for afterload reduction. When the patient&apos;s creatinine
stabilized , these were changed back to an ACE inhibitor. The
patient was continued on a beta-blocker as well. The patient was
restarted on half of his home dose of Lasix at Lasix 160 mg p.o.
daily as of 1/6/2006 when he was noted to be mildly
hypervolemic.
In addition , the patient was noted to have significant
hypertension. He has had a workup previously for secondary
causes of hypertension , which included a negative MRA in 2004.
The patient was continued on a clonodine patch as well as
beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , and Imdur. The patient&apos;s home
medication of hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued , as was the
amiloride , which may need to be reinitiated as an outpatient.
Rhythm: The patient was noted to have four beats of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia on 11/7/2005 , which resolved with
aggressive electrolyte replacement. While in the MICU , the
patient had a single run of 30 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia , which improved with electrolyte replacement.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and therefore
was continued on a regimen of NPH initially at 20 units b.i.d.
The patient was noted to have an episode of hypoglycemia with
blood sugars around 40 and therefore the NPH was decreased and
the patient will be discharged on a regimen of 15 units in the
morning and 10 units at bedtime.
The patient was also noted to have hyperparathyroidism likely
from renal disease , therefore secondary versus tertiary
hyperparathyroidism. The patient was therefore continued on
calcitriol.
Renal: The patient has stage IV chronic renal insufficiency.
Upon admission , the patient was noted to be oliguric. This is
likely due to a prerenal state given diuresis on admission and
further exacerbated by the patient&apos;s underlying renal disease.
Bladder scan was obtained which only showed 3 mL of urine in the
bladder. The patient&apos;s urine output increased with afterload
reduction. The patient was noted to have acute-on-chronic
respiratory acidosis with chronic bicarbonate compensation.
There was no anion gap. The lactate was measured and was only
0.6 in the MICU. Throughout the remainder of the
hospitalization , the patient&apos;s creatinine continued to improve
and was measured at 3.4 on 1/6/2006 .  A renal consult was
obtained during the hospitalization. They did not feel that
there was any indication for acute renal replacement. The
patient should continue to have renally dosed meds and continue
on a renal diet , including Phoslo. The patient will have close
renal followup within the next few weeks.
Hematologic: The patient was noted to have iron deficiency
anemia and was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation. At
this time , an EPO level is still pending.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initiated on levofloxacin
for a 14-day course , which was started on 4/13/2005 , and will be
completed as of 9/11/2006 .  Blood cultures and sputum cultures
were obtained and are negative to date. Influenza/adenovirus/RSV
swabs were obtained and were negative.
Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin subcutaneous 5000
units t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis , and was continued on Pepcid for
GI prophylaxis.
DISPOSITION: The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and
felt to be at his baseline. He is able to ambulate and maintain
his pulse oxymetry greater than 93%. The patient will be
discharged to home with visiting nurse service.
TO DO:
1. VNA is to check the patient&apos;s blood pressure , oxygen
saturation , as well as check weekly electrolytes and creatinine
levels and call results to Dr. Loil office at 890-189-0562.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Johanns within the next week ,
and at that time , should have his blood pressure meds titrated up
as needed. The patient may require increased dose of Lasix and
the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be resumed as needed.
2. The patient should have a cardiology outpatient followup
regarding his decreased EF and new wall motion abnormalities.
The patient may require stress imaging for further cardiac risk
stratification.
3. The patient should have renal follow up regarding his chronic
renal insufficiency and future need for hemodialysis.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to take all of your medications ,
including the Spiriva and Advair , which replace the Flovent as
well as the prednisone. Follow up with Dr. Lapeyrouse within one
week. Participate with your visiting nurse services. Seek
medical attention for increased shortness of breath , chest pain ,
fever , chills , or any other concerns. Weigh yourself daily and

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: GROVER SCHECHTMAN MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Urinary tract infection and lower extremity
edema.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Atrial fibrillation , venous
stasis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old woman with a
history of atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure and
lower extremity edema who was admitted to J.alva Health with increased calf swelling , weight gain , leg pain and
malaise. Over the past few months prior to admission , the
patient had noted a gradual weight gain to about a total of 20
pounds in two months. She had noted an increase in her chronic
lower extremity edema with increasing pain over the last moth
such that she has been taking Percocet for the pain. For the two
to three days prior to admission , the patient complained of
feeling &quot;weak&quot; and unable to get up out of bed due to fatigue and
general malaise. She denies any increasing shortness of breath.
She has had no chest pain , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She
always sleeps with the head of her bed elevated , but generally
has not noted any problem with lying flat. The patient has had
some complaint issues with her torsemide in the past due to lack
of ability to pay for medications; however , she states she has
been taking her medications as directed in the weeks prior to
admission. She has had no cough , no fevers and chills. No
dysuria , no diarrhea , no nausea or vomiting.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive only for nasal congestion and
chronic constipation.
The patient presented to the emergency department with her chief
complaint of weakness and increasing edema. In the emergency
department , she had lower extremity non-invasive ultrasound
studies , which were negative for DVT and a urinalysis revealed
UTI. She was treated in the ED with 500-mg levofloxacin and
40-mg IV Lasix , which resulted in a 1700 cc urine output. Of
note , the patient does have a Lasix allergy , which gives her rash
and GI upset. She does tolerate torsemide. Lasix was given in
the ED before it was known the patient have Lasix allergy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation onset 1986 , on Coumadin.
2. Pacemaker single chamber.

function.
ALLERGIES:
1. Quinidine causing rash.
2. Lasix causing rash and GI upset.
3. Penicillin reaction unknown.
4. Erythromycin reaction unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Medications at admission include:
1. Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
2. Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.
3. Torsemide 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Percocet p.r.n.
5. Senna two tablets b.i.d.
6. Colace two tablets b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Social history notable for the fact that the
patient lives alone; however , she does get help with meals and
housework , her family is involved.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At admission was notable for vital as
follows , 98.2 , heart rate 81 , blood pressure 114/60 , respirations
20 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient was a
tired-appearing woman sitting in bed in no acute distress. HEET
exam notable for a nonreactive right pupil. Jugular venous
pulsation was visible at approximately 8 cm. Heart exam revealed
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a 2 out of 6
systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border with no
radiation. Neck exam revealed jugular venous pulsations at
approximately 8 cm. Heart exam reveals regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 , S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border with no radiation. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Extremities revealed extensive
bilateral edema with chronic venous stasis pigmentary changes and
brawny erythremia of the lower shins. DP and PT pulses were not
palpable , but feet were 1.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs at admission were notable for creatinine
of 1.3 , which was consistent with her baseline , creatinine and
the white blood count of 11.5. Hematocrit of 38.3 also
consistent with her baseline. INR was 2.8 and PTT was 48.1.
Cardiac enzymes were negative. BNP was 232. Urinalysis revealed
20 to 25 white blood cells per high-powered field on analysis of
sediment. Chest x-ray revealed persistent mild cardiomegaly ,
some chronic intrastitial markings and a single lead pacemaker.
EKG was completely V-paced rate of 80.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: In summary , this is an 87-year-old
woman admitted with leg pain and swelling and weight gain likely
secondary to chronic venous stasis and with general malaise due
to urinary tract infection.
1. Infectious disease , urinary tract infection. The patient was
treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin and a urine culture
was sent , which had no growth at the time of discharge , but was
not yet finalized. Final results pending and discharged.
2. Cardiovascular , the patient has symptoms of total body volume
overloaded in her lower extremities; however , she had symptoms of
left-sided heart failure and it is likely the swelling in her
legs is more secondary to chronic venous stasis than to
right-sided heart failure per se. She was treated with diuresis
with an increased dose of torsemide 40 gm IV b.i.d. was placed on
the low-salt diet and did have a total diuresis of approximately
two liters over the course of her hospital stay with decrease in
swelling of the lower extremity. She was also given TED hose to
compress and mobilize fluid and was maintained with her legs
elevated for anytime that she was resting in bed or in the chair.
The patient was also maintained on her usual cardiovascular
medications including Lopressor and coumadin.
3. Heme. The patient was on Coumadin with the therapeutic INR.
Her lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative for DVT.
4. Cord status. The patient&apos;s cord status is do not
resuscitate , do not intubate.
5. The patient&apos;s final disposition was still pending at the time
of dication. She will be discharged to either to home with
services or to rehab pending final evaluation by physical therapy
regarding her safety with ambulation and mobility at home. An
addendum to discharge summary with final disposition and follow
up will be dictated.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Medications at discharge are as
follows:
1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48 year old gentleman
with cardiac risk factors including
diabetes; adult onset , hypertension , positive family history ,
dyslipidemia , and also with a distant tobacco use history and with
severe obesity. The patient has a long history of coronary artery
disease starting in 1989. The patient presented with angina and
ruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. In 1991 he had
unstable angina. A catheterization revealed 100% LAD lesion
proximally , 60% D-1 , 70% distal left circumflex , and normal right
coronary artery. PTCA to the LAD was performed with 30% residual
lesion. In 1992 the patient had two myocardial infarctions. In
February of 1992 a re-catheterization showed an additional lesion of
an OM-2 with 60% complex lesion with a mid LAD total occlusion with
right-to-left collaterals and diffuse PDA disease. In February of
1992 a repeat catheterization was performed for continued unstable
angina and the patient had an 80% left circumflex lesion , a 70%
OM-2 , 100% proximal LAD , 70% distal left circumflex , 70% OM-2.
Over this time period between 1991 and 1992 , the patient had a
total of four myocardial infarctions including a large anterior
wall myocardial infarction. The patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting in February of 1992 which was complicated by
ventricular fibrillation arrest in the postoperative Intensive Care
Unit. The patient received a LIMA to the LAD , SVG to the OM-1 and
an SVG to the OM-2. The patient had a repeat catheterization in
February of 1994 for unstable angina which showed diffuse native
disease: 100% LAD with right-to-left collaterals , 70% distal left
circumflex , 100% proximal OM-1 , 100% OM-2 , 50% mid right coronary
artery. The grafts were patent. Since that time the patient has
had minimal chest pain. The patient was seen in the clinic most
recently in January of 1997 for exertional chest pain. The patient
did well with an increase in his Atenolol dose.
On the day of admission today , for this admission , the patient
experienced chest burning at rest while watching TV with no
emotional or exertional stress. The pain lasted 40 minutes ,
radiating to the jaw with an intensity of 8 out of 10. The patient
took a shower without relief , took five sublingual Nitroglycerin
tablets without relief. The patient presented to the Emergency Ward
where his pain was relieved in the Waiting Room. The patient had
no nausea or vomiting , diaphoresis or shortness of breath. The
patient has had no increasing dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea or PND
recently; however the patient is not physically active. Of note ,
an echocardiogram in 1993 showed an ejection fraction of 40% with
apical akinesis and septal hypokinesis.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese , pleasant male in
no distress. Vital signs: Temperature
97.6 , pulse 88 , blood pressure 127/64 , respirations 18 , oxygen
saturation was 95% on room air. JVP was eight centimeters. There
was a normal S1 and S2. There was a positive S4 , no S3. There was
a 1/6 holosystolic murmur with no radiation. Left basilar crackles
were noted. There was a large abdomen with good peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , BUN 18 , creatinine
0.8 , CK 370 , MB 9.1 , troponin 0.21. White blood
cell count 13 , 000 , hematocrit 45.7 , platelet count 253 , 000 , INR
2.4 , PTT 37.6. The patient&apos;s chest x-ray was of poor quality , with
no congestive heart failure and mild cardiomegaly , and bibasilar
atelectasis. The patient&apos;s EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 75 , Q waves in III and aVF , V1 and V2. ST elevations in
III and aVF of one millimeter , ST depressions and T wave inversions
in I and L , but no changes when compared to the patient&apos;s baseline
EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction , and given his extensive history of
previous coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass
grafting , it was felt most likely that the patient is now
developing an occlusion of his grafted vessels versus occlusion of
his right coronary system. The patient&apos;s peak CK was 370 with
positive MB. The patient was continued on aspirin , Lopressor ,
Captopril , Simvastatin , and IV heparin , and Nitropaste sliding
scale. The next morning the patient was taken to the
Catheterization Lab where the previous native disease was noted ,
but additional disease of the RCA with serial mid 90% lesions ,
which were stented , a PDA of serial 70 and 90% lesions were
dilated. The patient was placed on Ticlid. The patient
experienced no chest pain after the procedure and EKGs had shown no
changes after the procedure. A submax Bruce protocol exercise
treadmill test was negative prior to discharge.
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes and his
Metformin was held before the catheterization
procedure , and the patient was continued on insulin sliding scale
and his Glyburide without complications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q

Discharge Date: 11/17/1990
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is the second Tal Hospital admission for this 55 year
old white gentleman who in 11/23 was first admitted for cardiac
catheterization for unstable angina. His cardiac risk factors
include adult-onset diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia ,
hypertension , family history of coronary artery disease , and prior
myocardial infarction. In 1982 , he developed exertional angina
treated with Isordil and in 1989 had a stress Thallium test which
showed mild inferior wall ischemia. In 11/23 he was admitted to
Tonm Medical Center for unstable angina and ruled out for
MI. His unstable angina continued and he was admittedo on 2/25/90
for cardiac catheterization to further study his coronary artery
disease. This catheterization showed a 95% left anterior
descending stenosis proximally and 80% distally , 95% proximal
occlusion of the right coronary artery , and an 80% occlusion of the
posterior descending artery. His cardiac index was 3.7 and it was
decided to schedule the patient for coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery which he underwent on 3/8/90 .  He had a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery saphenous vein
grafts to the posterior descending and diagonal branches. His
course in the ICU was uncomplicated and he was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day #2 , where his course was complicated by
a few episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation with maintenance
of good blood pressure but some symptoms of lightheadedness and
diaphoresis.
DISPOSITION: This was brought under good control with Procainamide
and he was discharged on 3/8/90 on Procainamide one
gram p.o.q.i.d. and Glipizide 2.5 mg p.o.b.i.d. , and aspirin once
per day. Followup with Dr. Leon Wilson L. Bierman of PMVH .

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: MICHAELS , TYRELL MERLIN MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , left ventricular
aneurysm.
PROBLEM LIST:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is a 64-year-old
gentleman with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction in
1976 with resultant left ventricular aneurysm and congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. He
has had increasing chest pain with exertion over the last
several years , which led to an evaluation for ischemia.
Catheterization at the Ville Tionsgon County Hospital in Flint Ent Nyjer showed a 70% left
main lesion and a previously known 100% LAD , OM and RCA disease.
The patient had previously undergone a SPECT thallium scan
2/3/06 in Moineslumvale Ri Cons , which showed a large anterior anteroseptal
infarct involving the septum , anterior wall and apical walls that
were entirely scarred and the lateral wall viability
was unclear on that scan. A chest CT performed in October of 2006 showed a
large left ventricular dilation with remodeling and calcified and
thinned left ventricular apex. His past history is also notable
for a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia dating back
to 1983. He had his first AICD placed in 1990 at Woodtwin Memorial Hospital
and this was replaced at the PMC in 1993 with a rate-sensing lead via
the left subclavian vein , and in 1997 , a CPI mini AICD was
placed. On presentation on this admission , he did not have a
history of angina , but did have a history of class III heart
failure with marked limitation of physical activity. He was in
atrial fibrillation , which is his baseline rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned above , includes also diabetes
with oral treatment only , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia and gout.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable for
a cholecystectomy in 80s and ICD placed via an open chest in
1990 , replacement in 1992 and in 1997 , appendectomy , right
inguinal hernia repair in 1986.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is unremarkable , no history
of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has an eight-pack year cigarette
smoking history. He has an alcohol intake of two drinks per
month and the patient was formerly a dentist.
ALLERGIES: His allergies include erythromycin giving a rash ,
amiodarone with a suspected pulmonary toxicity and elevated LFTs.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. daily.
2. Valsartan 80 mg p.o. daily.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
4. Isosorbide 30 mg b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
6. Coumadin 1.5 mg daily.
7. Furosemide 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Simvastatin 40 mg daily.
9. Coreg 25 mg b.i.d.
10. Synthroid 50 mcg daily.
11. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
12. Potassium 20 mEq daily.
13. Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d.
14. Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for this gentleman
who was 5 feet 10 inches and 95 kg in no acute distress. His
vital signs were temperature of 97.8 , heart rate of 70 , blood
pressure of 122/70 and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He had
no detectable carotid bruits. Examination of the chest was
notable for a midline sternotomy scar that was well healed and an
irregular rhythm. No murmurs were appreciated. His breath
sounds were clear and equal bilaterally. His abdomen was notable
for scars from a previous right cholecystectomy and a left lower
quadrant incision for placement of ICD. There were no masses and
the abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were without
scaring or edema and he did not have varicosities present.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: An echocardiogram performed at the
Beauton Geson Health Care Services on 9/24/06 showed an ejection
fraction of 25% with mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency and an AICD wire in the right heart.
OPERATION PROCEDURES: On 6/16/06 , the patient underwent a
mitral valve repair with an Alfieri suture , a CABG x3 with a
Y-graft saphenous vein; SVG2 connects SVG1 to LVB1 , SVG1 connects
to aorta to OM1 , SVG3 to ramus , a left ventricular aneurysm
repair and epicardial lead placement. The bypass time was 257
minutes. The cross-clamp time was 98 minutes.
ICU COURSE:
1. Neurologic: The patient was brought to the Intensive Care
Unit from the operating room on a propofol drip. He was
adequately sedated. Sedation was weaned and he was extubated
without incident. The patient&apos;s pain was well controlled with
p.r.n. Toradol. This was transitioned over to Motrin and he was
taking p.o.s and p.r.n. Morphine. He also was continued on his
own dose of Clonazepam 2.5 mg b.i.d. He was neurologically
intact throughout the course of his ICU stay and he was
transferred to floor with no focal deficits , moving all
extremities and pain that is well controlled.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought to the ICU on
Neosynephrine , epinephrine and milrinone drips. The milrinone was
initially given a weaning trial , but his mixed venous oxygen
saturations dropped to the high 40s and low 50s and the milrinone
was restarted. The Neosynephrine was the first drip to be
discontinued and the patient remained on milrinone and
epinephrine. Both of these were slowly weaned , the epinephrine
coming off first and the milrinone coming off two days prior to
transfer out of the ICU. He was in rapid atrial fibrillation and
was initially loaded with digoxin , which did improve the rate
transiently. He continued to have marginal mixed venous oxygen
saturation and poor cardiac performance as assessed by cardiac
output and cardiac index. Postoperatively , he had an intraaortic
balloon pump. The intraaortic balloon pump remained in until
postoperative day# 9 when it was discontinued. Slowly the drips
were weaned. He was started on an afterload reducing agent ,
first a drip of sodium nitroprusside , after he had had a trial of
esmolol. The esmolol did improve his rates slightly but did not
significantly improve his cardiac output or his mixed venous
oxygen saturation. He did seem to have improvement with the
afterload reducing agent of sodium nitroprusside. His rapid
atrial fibrillation remained refractory to medical treatment. He
was given trial of ibutilide , which did not significantly change
his rate or convert him into sinus rhythm. He was loaded with
amiodarone in spite of his prior history of pulmonary and hepatic
toxicity with plan to use a short course of amiodarone to improve
the rate. His rate did improve. He remained in atrial
fibrillation and did not convert to sinus. On postoperative day
8 , he was taken to the operating room and cardioverted
successfully to sinus rhythm. Transesophageal echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 30% and no clots in the atrial
ventricles. He remained in a sinus rhythm for approximately
three days until postoperative day 11 when he switched back into
atrial fibrillation that was refractory to ibutilide. Attempted
cardioversion was done the following day , which failed , and he
remained in atrial fibrillation on transfer to the floor. His
rate was better controlled in the 80s to 90s and he was on a
regimen of digoxin , afterload-reducing agent Captopril 25 mg q.6
h. and low-dose Lopressor 6.25 mg q.i.d. His pulmonary artery
catheter was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor , and on
transfer to the floor , his mixed venous oxygen saturation was
improved in the high 50s to low 60s.
3. Pulmonary: Initially , the patient required BIPAP while in
the Intensive Care Unit. He needed an aggressive diuresis to
improve his pulmonary status but transfer to the floor , he was
down to 3 L nasal cannula and he was able to ambulate and get out
of bed.
4. GI: The patient was initially started on clear liquids and
was taking very minimal p.o.&apos;s because he had a significant BIPAP
requirement. As the BIPAP was weaned , his diet was advanced and
he was tolerating a regular diet on transfer to floor. He did
have several episodes of diarrhea. Fecal leukocytes and
Clostridium difficile were sent and were negative and the
diarrhea was resolving on transfer to the floor.
5. GU: The patient was aggressively diuresed with a Lasix drip
and with Diuril boluses. His creatinine tolerated the
aggressively diuresis. His sodium remained low in the 130s and
he was transitioned off the Lasix drip to p.o. Lasix and
continued to be negative on transfer to the floor.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and
hypothyroidism. He was maintained on dose of Synthroid initially
IV. Then , that was transitioned to p.o. when he was tolerating
p.o.&apos;s. He was on subcutaneous insulin and his sugars were well
controlled. Initially , he was on Portland protocol and was then
transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.
7. Heme: The patient was anticoagulated with heparin initially
for the intraaortic balloon pump and atrial fibrillation. He did
have a marked drop in his platelets and was positive for
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. He was started on argatroban
and bridged to Coumadin. On transfer to the floor , he remains on
argatroban with a goal PTT of 50 to 70 and he is getting Coumadin
with goal INR 2 to 3.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had an elevated while blood
cell count throughout the course of his ICU hospital stay. He
had the intraaortic balloon pump in place for nine days. He was
seen by ID and his only positive blood culture was a
coag-negative staph that was believe to be a contaminant. He was
on vancomycin for many days that was not discontinued. He does
have a history of right knee gout , which did flare while he was
in the Intensive Care Unit and part of his elevated blood cell
count was attributed to that. He was started on colchicine and
Allopurinol.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: On transfer to the floor , the patient was
on following medications:
1. Captopril 25 mg p.o. q.6 h.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
4. Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.
6. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
7. Clonazepam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. daily.
9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Regular insulin sliding scale.
11. Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. daily.
12. Magnesium and potassium scales.
13. Ambien 5 mg p.o. at bedtime.
14. Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.
15. Lantus 12 units subcutaneously at bedtime.
16. Darbepoetin alfa 40 mcg subcutaneous.
17. NovoLog sliding scale and NovoLog four units subcutaneously
with lunch and six units with dinner.
DISPOSITION: He was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: He will need continued evaluation with physical and
occupational therapy.

CC: exertional SOB
HPI: 77yoM w/ hx CAD s/p CABG 2003 , p/w 2 weeks of increasing exertional
dyspnea. At baseline can walk 4-5 blocks , over last couple weeks can
only walk about 1 block before becoming SOB. Was also getting SOB w/
minimal activity at home including showering. Sleeps on one pillow , no
orthopnea , no PND. Has had some pedal edema over the few weeks.
Increased urination and increased thirst , no reported change in diet.
Recently stopped HCTZ but no other change in meds. Also w/ some dull
chest pain over left side that radiates in a band like fashion across his
stenum to back , 3-4/10 in intensity , not brought on by activity , lasts
for seconds at a time when present , pleuritic. Reproducible w/
palpation. Pt had fallen on his right side several weeks earlier. Some
dull abdominal discomfort in lower quadrants usually improved with bowel
movements , last BM yesterday. No n/v. No calf tenderness , no recent
surgery , no recent travel. March wt 158lbs by records , pt has not
noticed any weight gain.
Pt reports not having this pain previously , however by records pt was
evaluated in 3/2/05 for similar atypical chest pains that was
ultimately a neg workup , with ECHO 4/9 w/ diastolic dysfn EF 60-65% , no
WMA , mod MR , mod TR , stress test 8/13 w/ no changes c/w ischemia on EKG
or ECHO ( but non-diagnositic due to peak HR 64 BP 140/66 ). He was seen
by Dr Decuir at that time who felt that ACS/ischemia was unlikely , and
that symptoms may have been 2/2 CHF and MR ( and his ECHO also showed new
AI at that time ) , and pt was apparently started on ACE at that time for
afterload reduction. He is not on an ACE right now and it is unclear
why. Further w/u of ischemia was suggested if the pt had persistent
symptoms but the symptoms seemed to have resolved by these notes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Kanady is a 47-year-old gentleman with history of
hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia who
presented to the Emergency Department on 4/18/02 with
substernal chest pressure , and ST depressions in V4 and V6 after
undergoing a stress test. He was in his usual state of health
until 1 month prior to admission when he started noticing a
burning in his chest while walking to work. This progressed to a
point where the pain was present with minimal exertion such as
moving a chair. The burning was relieved by rest. He saw his
primary care physician two days prior to admission who started
him on Atenolol and Nitroglycerin spray. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 3/28/06 , which revealed right
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis and an ostial 60%
stenosis , a ramus coronary artery with a proximal 90% stenosis ,
left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 70%
stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery with a mid 50%
stenosis , first diagonal coronary artery with a proximal 50%
stenosis and a right dominant circulation. Echocardiogram
performed on 3/25/06 revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild
mitral insufficiency , and mild tricuspid insufficiency.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Quesenberry was brought to the operating room on 7/12/06 where
he underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft x5 with a
sequential graft right radial artery from the aorta to the right
coronary artery and then the first obtuse marginal coronary
artery and left internal mammary artery from the first diagonal
coronary artery and then the left anterior descending coronary
artery and a right radial graft to this left circumflex coronary
artery. Total bypass time was 200 minutes and total crossclamp
time was 145 minutes. The patient did well intraoperatively ,
came off bypass without incident. He was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.
Postoperatively , the patient did well. He was extubated and
transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #2. He
initially had an inferolateral ST changes and a CK bump , which
did trend down at time of transfer to the Step-Down Unit. On
postoperative echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%
with no regional wall motion abnormalities. He was also started
on Motrin q. 6h. for postoperative pericarditis and the patient ,

Discharge Date: 6/23/2004
ATTENDING: RAYMUNDO RODRIUEZ MD
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with the last FEV1 of 0.42 ,
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately
40% , who was transferred from Bradpark Hospital for continued
treatment for worsening shortness of breath. The patient reports
that one week prior to her admission to the Daspe I Health ,
two days before transfer to the Ordma Medical Center , the
patient felt more dyspneic on exertion. She noted that she is
having a hard time even getting to the bathroom. Ordinarily , at
home , her baseline using 1.5 liters of oxygen at rest , but able
to get around the house and upstairs. She went to Lahorn Mulg Medical Center on Sunday. She reports that she had a dry cough without
any sputum production. No fever or chills. No sick contacts.
No hemoptysis. No runny nose or sore throat. This is different
from her usual COPD excerebration , in which it is no longer
proceeded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection.
In addition , the history reveals that the patient usually uses
two pillows to sleep , but recently had been using two pillows
folded and felt short of breath if she lay down more than that.
She would wakeup in the middle of the night when she was short of
breath , but there was no change in that symptom over the previous
months.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has gained 15 pounds in one year
prior to admission. She believes that it was due to previous
steroid use. She also notes that she had some diarrhea that was
&quot;like pudding&quot; 1-3 times per day. Not watery , not bloody , and
not black. No recent antibiotic use.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to aminophyllin. She has
hypotension and arrhythmias from that. She has a reaction to
beta-blockers in which she has worsening breathing.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD in August , 2004. The patient had a FEV1 of 0.42 and
FVC of 1.95.
2. Congestive heart failure , April 2003. An echocardiogram
showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% , inferior
hypokinesis. The ventricle is normal. There is mild aortic
insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation , normal atria , and
normal tricuspid valve.
3. Cerebrovascular accident.
4. Type II diabetes when she takes steroids.
5. Hypertension.
6. Osteoarthritis.
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8. Depression and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS: On admission ,
1. Advair 250/50 mg.
2. Albuterol.
3. Atacand 4 mg each day.
4. Celexa 60 mg each day.
5. Clonazepam 0.5 mg two times a day.
6. Coumadin 2.5 mg on Monday and Sunday , and 5 mg on other days.
7. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day.
8. Folate 1 mg a day.
9. Fosamax 70 mg per week.
10. Lasix 40-60 mg each morning , which the patient had not been
taking because it made her pee too much.
11. Atrovent inhaler.
12. Ritalin 5 mg every morning and at lunch , although she does
not feel that it was benefiting her.
13. Prilosec 20 mg a day.
14. Probenecid 250 mg two times a day.
15. Tylenol No.3 q.6h. as needed.
16. Vioxx 25 mg each day.
17. Home oxygen 1.5 liters at rest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.4 degrees
Fahrenheit , heart rate was 120 and regular , blood pressure was
142/60 , respiratory rate was 24 , and sating 95% on 2 liters of
nasal cannula. General: The patient was talking 2-3 words at a
time. She cannot speak in full sentences. She is using
accessory muscles for breathing. Her jugular venous pressure was
elevated , but with significant respiratory phasic variation. The
patient&apos;s hand veins also revealed an increased venous pressure.
The patient had no pallor and no jaundice. Her extraocular
motions were intact. Her pupils were equal and reactive to
light. The patient&apos;s oropharynx revealed thrush on the tongue.
Chest exam: There were decreased breath sounds. They were soft
and expiratory wheezes at the bases. No crackles and no rhonchi.
Cardiovascularly , the rhythm was regular , tachycardiac , with a
1-2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen was soft , ,
nontender , and nondistended. There were bowel sounds.
Extremities: There was no edema , nontender. Symmetric
extremities. No clubbing.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband of 43 years.
They have no children. The patient has not used tobacco since
1984. She has occasional alcohol use. She notes that she drinks
one drink every month approximately.
At the outside hospital the patient&apos;s labs were as follows. Her
white count was 12 with 75% neutrophils , 3 eosinophils , and 6-12
bands forms. Hematocrit was 45. Her platelet count was 290 , 000.
Her PTT was 42. Her INR was 2.2. Her Chem-7 and her sodium was
139. Her potassium was 4.5. Her chloride 101 and bicarbonate
was 31 and BUN was 20. Her creatine was 1.1. Her glucose was
118. Her total protein was 7.7 with an albumin of 4.2 , AST of
29 , ALT of 43 , and alkaline phosphatase of 104. Total bilirubin
is 0.3. Her pH was 7.38 with the carbon dioxide of 54 and an
oxygen of 37 on 20% FiO2 , which is ambient air. This was noted
to be an arterial blood gas. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at
120 beats per minutes. QRS width was approximately 120
milliseconds in a left bundle branch pattern with normal axis.
No left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. She had 1-2 mm
ST-depression in 2 , 3 and AVF with T-wave inversions in those
leads , also T-wave inversions with 1 mm ST depression in V5 and
V6. The only change from the January , 2004 , EKG is that of
T-wave inversion in V5 , otherwise stable.
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was thought to
be a 60-year-old woman with severe COPD and CHF , who presented
with worsening shortness of breath consistent with a COPD
excerebration. However , this was unlike many of her previous
exacerbations in that she did not experience any upper
respiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venous
pressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might be
having a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well.
1. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation ,
with prednisone 60 mg by mouth each morning , Atrovent and
albuterol nebulizers q.4h. and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers
as needed. She was also continued on levofloxacin. Initially ,
the patient received 500 mg of levofloxacin a day. As her renal
function worsened that was changed to 150 mg a day and when her
renal function improved again her levofloxacin was once again
increased to 500 mg a day. This should be continued for a 10-day
course. There is little concern for pulmonary embolism , given
the patient&apos;s elevated INR. However , she did have a decreased O2
saturation and her CO2 was not very elevated at the outside
hospital. A D-dimer was sent which was less than 200 , which is
negative , suggestive very highly for a pulmonary embolism. The
patient&apos;s pulmonary status improved throughout her stay , and by
May , 2004 , she was sating in the 90% range on 2 liters nasal
cannula , almost at baseline. It was thought by the physical
therapy that the patient would benefit from further pulmonary
rehabilitation. As this dictation is being done , the plan is for
her either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at the
hospital until she is fully ready and safe to go home , and is not
at an increased fall risk given her severe osteoporosis.
2. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: Initially , the patient was thought to possibly be
volume overloaded given the fact that she was not taking her
Lasix and that her JVP appeared elevated. In addition , there was
some question whether she might has been having increasing
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea. She was
initially diuresed aggressively with 60 mg of IV Lasix , two
times. However , lab results suggested that congestive heart
failure was not a large part of her presentation. First , the
brain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value of
proximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 ,
suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of her
heart failure. In addition , the patient&apos;s creatinine increased
from her outside hospital value of 1.0. When it was first
checked at 1:00 in the morning on January , 2004 , at Clinchau Hospital , it was 1.7. She received her two doses of
Lasix , one on the night of November , 2004 , and then again in the
morning of January , 2004. Her creatinine in the afternoon of March , 2004 , increased to 2.2. Urine electrolytes were sent and the
acute renal failure workup will be discussed below under the
renal section. In terms of her heart failure , the patient was
given IV fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heart
failure. Her normal dose of 40 mg of Lasix p.o. every morning
was restarted on September , 2004 , and she will be continued on that
dose.
B. Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and after her
sinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemia
improved and she had no further issues.
C. Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin HMG-COA
reductase inhibitor. She was continued on her folic acid , as
well. She was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospastic
response to that , but she was continued on her angiotensin
receptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved.
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.0
from the outside hospital and 1.71 when she first presented. Her
baseline is in the low 1&apos;s; 1.0-1.5 as her baseline. The peak
creatinine during her stay was January , 2004 , at 5:00 p.m. and it
was 2.2. Her BUN at that time was 55. Urine electrolytes were
sent , which showed a urine sodium of 39 , and creatinine of 137 ,
and that was only 12 hours after the patient got her last dose of
Lasix. It was felt that the patient had prerenal azotemia and
was given IV fluids. Her creatinine improved , and on May ,
2004 , the patient&apos;s creatinine was 1.3 , approximately her
baseline. Her BUN at that time was 30 , increased from 23 on April , 2004. The patient will be monitored as an outpatient to make
sure that her Lasix dose is not too high.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient&apos;s creatine kinase was elevated
on admission to 574. It was rechecked on April , 2004 , and it
was 1967. It was felt that this was due to two factors.
Increased release from the muscle , as the patient&apos;s MB-fraction
was only 33.5 , which was less than 5% and the troponin was
negative. So this was felt to be due to her increased work of
breathing and release from the muscle and exacerbated by her
acute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase. Her
creatine kinase decreased by July , 2004 , to 1195. Therefore ,
it was not felt that the patient had rhabdomyolysis causing renal
failure , but rather renal failure causing retention of creatine
kinase disease from increased work of breathing.
5. Hematology: The patient was continued on her Coumadin. The
patient&apos;s INR throughout her stay remained therapeutic between
2.4 and 2.6. On May , 2004 , it was 2.5. She was continued on
her home dose. The patient&apos;s white blood cell count was elevated
at admission at the outside hospital with a left shift. She was
started on levofloxacin and steroids. Therefore , it is difficult
to interpret her white count deferential. Her white count
remained elevated between 15 and 20 throughout her stay. Her
neutrophil count remained between 70 and 78% of that. A
urinalysis was sent , which did not suggest that the patient had a
urinary tract infection.
6. The patient&apos;s TSH was 0.46 with a normal T4 of 7.8. She will
be followed up as an outpatient , as this may represent
subclinical hyperthyroidism. In addition to her thyroid , the
patient&apos;s osteoporosis was continued to be treated with calcium
carbonate , vitamin D , and Fosamax during her stay.
7. Rheumatology: The patient was continued on her probenecid
250 mg two times a day. She has no symptoms of gout.
8. Psychiatry: The patient was continued on her clonazepam and
Celexa. She was not continued on Ritalin and will not be
discharged on her Ritalin given her tachycardia. In addition ,
the patient did not feel that the Ritalin was helping her.
9. Pain. The patient&apos;s Vioxx was discontinued because of her
renal issues. This will also not be one of her discharge
medications and it should be reassessed by her primary care
doctor. The benefits may outweigh the risks , but this should be
up to Dr. Satterfield , who has a long-term relationship with the
patient.
10. Infectious disease: The patient had blood cultures sent ,
which were negative. At admission , in addition , her urinalysis
showed many red blood cells. It did have some white blood cells
and leucocyte esterase. This is most likely just because the
patient had bleeding , secondary to her Foley catheter.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please use the patient&apos;s discharge sheet
for discharge medications.

Discharge Date: 8/9/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SYNCOPE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. IDIOPATHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old woman who
has lived in Tall Dis Thou since 1993.
She has a history of chest pain and has a baseline EKG with an
intraventricular conduction delay , QRS interval of 0.10. Her
cardiac history includes: In February 1988 , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test for chest pain. The patient went 7 minutes
35 seconds and had a maximum heart rate of 100 , maximum blood
pressure not recorded. She developed a left bundle branch block
with exercise. A thallium scan showed no evidence of ischemia. In
September 1992 , she had an exercise tolerance test for chest pain and
shortness of breath. She went 9 minutes 0 seconds and had a
maximum heart rate of 167 with maximum blood pressure 138/60. She
developed angina during the test. The SPECT scan showed a moderate
fixed defect in the apicolateral wall. In 2/6 , she had an EKG
done which showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS interval of 0.10
and moderate LVH. In 1995 , the patient states that she had a
cardiac catheterization in Auriend Road , Kane Cho , Mississippi 13286 which showed no coronary
disease , although she was told that she had a cardiomyopathy. The
patient reports feeling well until the day of admission without any
chest pain , shortness of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or
orthopnea in the recent past. On the afternoon of admission , at
about 2 o&apos;clock in the afternoon , she was watching television. She
arose from the couch and went to the kitchen to get a cup of
coffee. She recalls filling her cup with water , then recalls
nothing else until she awoke with her grandchildren lying on half
of her on the floor and crying. The patient was oriented upon
awakening and recognized her grandchildren immediately. She did
not have any incontinence or tongue biting. She denied muscle
aches , somnolence , confusion , or weakness. She went to the couch
to sit down and had nausea and vomiting about five minutes after
her syncopal episode. She also noted a bump on the right side of
her head and subsequently developed a headache. She did not have
any neurologic symptoms , denied any chest pain or shortness of
breath. She was diaphoretic at the time that she was sitting on
the cough , nauseous and vomiting afterwards. She had no
palpitations and she had no presyncopal sensation or dizziness at
any time. She does report having a history of palpitations in the
past , but none on the day of admission. She had no fevers , chills ,
or other sick contacts. She had no prior history of syncope or
loss of consciousness. She had no history of seizures or transient
neurologic symptoms. In addition , she does report that she has a
history of chest pain. The last time was more than a year prior to
admission. She has no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no pedal
edema , no orthopnea , and no change in exercise tolerance recently.
She climbs stairs without any problems.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Chest pain , last
episode approximately one year prior to
admission. 3. Palpitations. 4. Question of cardiomyopathy ,
diagnosed by cardiac catheterization in Sa in 1995.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Vasotec 10 mg p.o. q.day. 2. Digoxin
0.25 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Lasix 20 mg q.day.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease , stroke ,
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sudden death.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke , does not drink
alcohol , and does not use IV drugs. She lives
with her daughter in Co Ville at this time of year. She works in an
outreach program as a nurse. She came from Ige Pkwy , Norfsta Olk Mer , New Hampshire 25909 where she
has been since 1993. Prior to that time , she was living in Birhamstonro
and receiving medical care at the Cla Du Rencein Hospital .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs included a blood pressure of
130/70 , pulse 62 ( the patient had a blood
pressure of 200/100 when initially seen in the Emergency
Department ). She was an elderly woman in no apparent distress.
Her HEENT examination was remarkable for having poor dentition.
Her JVP was at 8 cm. Her chest was clear. Her cardiovascular
examination revealed an S1 , S2 and intermittent S3 , no murmurs ,
with regular rate. Her abdomen was soft and nontender. Her
extremities were warm without any cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her mental status was
entirely intact. Cranial nerve examination was grossly intact.
Her reflexes were 2+ throughout and her toes did not respond to the
Babinski stimulation.
LABORATORY DATA: She had a CK of 119 , magnesium 2.2. Her digoxin
level was 0.7. Troponin I was 0. Electrolytes
were entirely within normal limits , as were BUN and creatinine.
White blood cell count was 10.3 , hematocrit 36.5 , and platelet
count 298. Urinalysis revealed 0-1 white cells , 0-1 red cells , 1+
bacteria , and 1+ epithelial cells. Chest x-ray revealed no
evidence of congestive heart failure or infiltrate. EKG , at the
time of admission , showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 93 with
intervals of 0.183 , 0.15 , and 0.417. She had a left bundle branch
block which was new since her 1993 EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for work up of her
syncopal episode. By hospital day one , the
patient underwent a rule out for myocardial infarction. Her
enzymes were flat and her EKG showed no changes consistent with
acute myocardial infarction. In addition , she underwent an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 30%-35%. She
also had anterolateral wall motion abnormalities. On the following
day , the patient underwent a right sided heart catheterization ,
which revealed that her coronary arteries were completely clean.
She underwent an EP study which was entirely normal. On the
following hospital day , she underwent an exercise tolerance test ,
and no arrhythmias were triggered by her exercise. Carotid
noninvasive studies revealed minimal disease bilaterally , and the
neurology service was consulted. The patient also underwent a tilt
table study , which was entirely normal , with no suggestion of a
vasovagal response. At the time of discharge , the patient had had
no further symptoms and no further episodes of syncope while in
hospital. Her Holter monitor results are pending. The feeling is
that her syncopal event was most likely cardiac related , probably
related to a tachycardic arrhythmia. However , her neurologic work
up is still underway. She is to have an MRI/MRA as an outpatient
and to follow up in DISPAN NI TI HOSPITAL clinic , as well as with Dr. Triche for
further discussion as to whether AICD placement might be in order.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day. 2. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.
Vasotec 15 mg p.o. q.day. 4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.day. 5. Atenolol
12.5 mg p.o. q.day.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home to follow up in
I MINVIC MEDICAL CENTER clinic with me ( Leo Paponetti ) on 4/29/97 .  She
will have an MRA/MRI of her brain scheduled as an outpatient. In
addition , she will be set up with an ECG loop recorder for further
monitoring of events at home.

Discharge Date: 7/2/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Fickas is a 53 year old woman with
history of diabetes mellitus type I ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , diastolic and systolic
dysfunction , last hospitalized at the Otpunx Hospital in
2/30 with congestive heart failure and did well with IV Lasix.
After discharge , the patient was able to follow her own weight.
Over the last three days , the patient claims that she has gained
5 lb of weight up 145 lb. , and attempted to increase Lasix dose to
40 mg p.o. q.i.d. without any success. She has also had about four
days of shortness of breath. She has only been able to walk about
2-3 blocks a day , but this has decreased to 1/2 a block. She has
also claimed she has had increasing orthopnea to three pillows and
some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She has also had some dietary
indiscretion , but has not had any medical noncompliance. This was
due to about two months ago , the patient in climbing a mountain ,
injured her knee and put into a knee immobilizer and she was unable
to walk very much so unable to mobilize fluid. She also claims
that she may have had difficulty keeping sodium intake below 2 gm ,
although husband claims that there was no an increase in sodium
intake. She does say a 4:30 p.m. , on the day of admission , the
patient had some neck and left shoulder pain , which was about 5/10 ,
no nausea or vomiting , no diaphoresis. This was relieved with one
sublingual nitroglycerin. She also says that she has had a cough
the Sunday before admission , nonproductive , no chills , no fevers ,
and no dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus complicated by nephropathy and
renal insufficiency , with proteinuria most likely secondary to
minimal change in neuropathy and retinopathy. She has had
long-standing hypertension , very difficult to control , with
extensive workup. Coronary artery disease and MI in 1986 , treated
with streptokinase , PTCA complicated by right groin hematoma and
retroperitoneal dissection. She has osteoporosis , cholecystectomy ,
question of multiple sclerosis , status post several MIs
inconclusive.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Elavil; aspirin; atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Vasotec
40 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. to q.i.d.;
Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , just started two days prior to admission;
Cozaar 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.; diltiazem 180 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.; insulin sliding scale with
Humalog and Ultralente 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. , 10 mg p.o. q.p.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a cigarettes smoker , one pack a
week x20 years , quit 12 years ago. No alcohol
use. Husband is an anesthesiologist at Saci Hospital Center ,
and she has two daughters.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father with hypertension and CVA , died from a MI
at 59. Mother with breast cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temp 98 , heart rate 66 , BP
165/81 , respiratory rate 26 , satting 93-94%
on room air. GENERAL: No acute distress. HEENT: PERRLA. NECK:
JVP to the angle of the jaw. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , positive S3 , II-III/VI
holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border
radiating to the apex. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended ,
with positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Minimal edema , 2+
pitting edema , sacral pitting edema , no calf tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 140 , K 3.6 , Cl 102 , bicarb 27 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.3 , baseline 1.8-2.1 , glucose 116.
CK 73 , Ca 9.3 , troponin 0.13. White blood cell count 8.98 ,
hematocrit 32.2 , platelets 333. Urine - 3+ protein , trace glucose.
Previous echocardiogram shows normal size and function. EF 60% ,
basal inferior hypokinesis , normal size and function , 2-3+ MR , with
mild eczematous dysfunction of valve , and mild left atrial
enlargement. ETT was done in 5/11 .  The patient went for four
minutes , heart rate 76 , BP 125/70. Her EKG showed evidence of
ischemia. Imaging report not on the computer.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed aggressively. On
3/6 , added clonidine and changed captopril
to ramipril for better long-acting blood pressure control for blood
pressures in the 190-200 range.
On 1/14 , increased Lasix and clonidine for improved diuresis
and blood pressure control , hyperproliferative normocytic anemia ,
begin erythropoietin , however erythropoietin level of 15 signifies
some erythropoietin production. Chest x-ray showed continued
pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. Sputum gram stain with 4+
polys , gram positive in clusters and chains , and a culture with 1+
oral flora.
On 2/8 , continued to diuresis patient well.
On 5/2 , creatinine 2.6 , discontinued Norvasc and clonidine.
On 7/23 , creatinine 3.0 , held the diuresis , discontinued ACE
inhibitor and ARD. MRI of the kidneys showed no evidence of renal
artery stenosis. An echo done the same day showed mild MR with an
EF of 45-50%. Dr. Galathe recommended holding all blood pressure
meds. Team also held all diuretics.
On 6/21 , creatinine to 4.0 , urine output only 450 cc in 24
hours despite a bolus of 500 cc.
On 10/10 , changed atenolol to metoprolol for a better renal
clearance. Discontinued Tiazac. Renal failure at the time was
thought to be secondary most likely to prerenal from hypotension
and hypovolemia. This patient was orthostatic , which lead to renal
acute tubular necrosis. The patient had casts in urine. Continued
to have nausea and was put on Compazine , Zofran , and Prilosec.
High protein and creatinine ratio. The patient had a continued
cough , low grade fever , and a white count. Chest x-ray showed no
evidence of infiltrates. Started levofloxacin for presumed URI.
She had a temperature spike to 101.5. She underwent fractional
excretion of sodium 0.61 , protein 4681 , creatinine 75.7 , osmolality
339. UA was bland. No eosinophils were seen. Albumin 3.8.
On 3/11 , BUN and creatinine was 109 and 6.8 , Na 124 , K 5.8. No
EKG changes were seen. The patient was administered Kayexalate
with subsequent drop in potassium. Magnesium and phosphate all
began to rise. The patient became oliguric and anuric , and
continued nausea and vomiting. The patient had more crackles , JVP ,
good sats. A 250 cc bolus of D5 1/2 normal saline was then
administered. Creatinine peaked to 7.2.
On 9/8 , the creatinine was back down to 6.4 without need for
dialysis intervention. Electrolytes were stable. The patient&apos;s
symptoms and exam improved. She continued better urine output.
The patient was transfused for a hematocrit of 28 with good
response.
On 5/25 , the creatinine was down to 4.4 , BUN 85. The patient
did feel much better , was diuresed six liters , and had clear lungs.
Increased the Lopressor to 37.5.
On 10/24 , the patient continued to diuresis after ATN recovery.
Lopressor was titrated up and ramipril was started after a
discussion with Dr. Lepore and Dr. Oligee .
On 2/23 , the patient was doing much better. Creatinine
improved. He continued to titrate up on Lopressor for a SBP of
130s. White blood cell count was mildly elevated to the 12 range.
UA and diff. were unremarkable. The patient is being discharged on
the following medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Elavil 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.; aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d.; erythropoietin 5000 U subcu.
b.i.w.; lactulose 30 ml p.o. q.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 0.4 mg 1

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Sholl
and Dr. Estremera this week before she leaves
for her trip. The patient is to also follow-up with
Dr. Geraldo Grageda at the next available appointment. She is going
on a very long extensive trip , and will need to follow her weight
and in&apos;s/out&apos;s as best she can. 60-61 kg is her dry weight. She
will adjust her medications accordingly to Dr. Archbell and
Dr. Demarcus recommendations.

Discharge Date: 1/29/2007
ATTENDING: LARR , ELVIS TED MD
PRINCIPAL ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Severe aortic stenosis and
congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Ms. Quist is an
81-year-old female with a known history of severe aortic stenosis
and multiple medical comorbidities who had been transferred from
an outside hospital to the Coronary Care Unit for
congestive heart failure likely related to overwhelming aortic
disease. She had previously declined aortic valve replacement in
the year prior to her admission. She had an echo performed at
outside hospital just prior to admission to Lumca Hospital showed an EF of 55-60% with severe aortic stenosis , an
aortic valve area of 0.6 cm square as well as 1+ mitral regurg
and 1-2+ tricuspid regurg. She was admitted to the medical
service at MH where she was aggressively diuresed. She was also
prepared for urgent aortic valve replacement and possible
coronary artery bypass grafting. At the time of her admission ,
her past medical history included hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , history of stroke with left upper extremity
sensory loss , diabetes type 2 , hypothyroidism ,
hypercholesterolemia , renal failure with bilateral renal artery
stenosis , parkinsonianism , iron-deficiency anemia , vitamin B12
deficiency , obstructive sleep apnea , seizure disorder and colon
cancer status post resection in 1987. She is unable to elaborate
on the details of that resection. She also had renal artery
stenting in 2005.
ALLERGIES: Stated allergies at the time of admission included
Lipitor for which she had myalgias and an erythromycin with a
reaction of which was unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Her admission medications include labetolol 150
p.o. daily , amlodipine 5 mg p.o. daily , Isordil 30 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Coumadin 5
p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg twice a day , Colace 100 mg twice a day ,
iron sulfate 325 once a day , folic acid 1 mg p.o. once day ,
hydralazine 25 mg daily and Synthroid 88 mcg daily as well as
Dilantin 300 mg p.o. twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , her physical
exam showed a woman 5 feet 1 inches tall , weighing 94 kilos in
obvious mild respiratory distress. Her temperature was 97 and heart
rate was 83 and sinus. Her blood pressure in the right arm was
120/63 , in the left arm was 109/53. She was on 5L of nasal
cannula while satting 99%. The remainder of her physical exam was
notable only for a loud holosystolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border and radiation to her both carotid arteries. Her
Allen&apos;s test showed severely dampened waveform in both left and
right radial arteries. Her chest sounded congested with rales
present bilaterally and her extremities showed 1-2+ bilateral
lower extremity edema. Her carotid , radial and femoral arteries
were all 2+ , but her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial were
present only by Doppler bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Notable lab data at the time of admission
included a BUN and creatinine of 79 and 3.1 respectively and a
beta natriuretic peptide of 39 , 085. Cardiac catheterization performed on
9/10/06 showed 60% lesion of the ostial LAD as well as an 80% proximal LAD
lesion. She also had 90% ostial D1 and a 40% ostial OM1 lesion and right
dominant circulation. Her echo on 5/26/06 showed an ejection fraction of
60% , severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 60 mmHg and a
peak gradient of 99 mmHg. Again her calculated valve area is 0.6
cm square. Her chest x-ray on 5/26/06 was consistent with
congestive heart failure and appeared very fluid overloaded. She
was taken on 9/10/06 to the operating room where aortic valve
replacement with aortic root patch was performed , 21 Biocor
porcine graft was inserted. She also had a two-vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting using vein to her left anterior descending
and vein grafting to her D1 vessel. She tolerated the procedure
relatively well , but her ensuing ICU course was protracted and
very complicated and will be summarized systematically.
Neurologically , the patient suffered no acute complications
postoperatively; however , her state of consciousness waxed and
waned with her overall condition.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient suffered a perioperative MI in
the late hours of 9/10/06 and on to the early hours of 5/17/06 .  She also
went into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two and
suffered rhythm abnormalities for the remainder of her
postoperative course. Multiple conversion attempts were made
both pharmaceutically as well as with electrocardioversion , but
she occasionally did covert to normal sinus rhythm. Ultimately ,
she reverted back into atrial fibrillation. The third
postoperative day , she became hypotensive and asystolic. Chest
compressions were initiated for less than one minute at which
time atrial pacing was initiated and her rhythm was regained with
adequate blood pressure , though she was returned on to several
days of active drips to support her blood pressure. From this
point , Ms. Pavick developed dependence on pressors and inotropic
agents to support her blood pressure and cardiovascular system.
After several months with no real recovery of her cardiovascular
status , the family decided to withdraw care and put her on
comfort measures only. She ultimately suffered a cardiac arrest
on 1/16/07 .
From a pulmonary perspective , while she was extubated on the morning of
postoperative day #2 , she was ultimately reintubated and several pulmonary
complications required multiple bronchoscopies , multiple thoracentesis on both
chest for recurrent effusions and several chest tubes had to be placed for
aforementioned effusions. She was ultimately trached by the third
week and although she did occasionally come off the ventilator at
times , she never displayed adequate pulmonary function to be free
from vent dependence for any length of time.
From a GI perspective , with her trach , she underwent a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube for enteral feeds and at times needed to be
placed on total parenteral nutrition as she only occassionally tolerated
tube feeds. She did develop a Clostridium difficile infection
and had to be placed on long-term TPN until resolution of that
infection.
Her renal status at baseline was poor , though she was not on dialysis.
Postoperatively , she never recovered any meaningful renal function of her own.
She was placed on continuous venovenous hemodialysis by the third
week ultimately became anuric , requiring triweekly hemodialysis on Monday ,
Wednesday and Friday , a schedule she was managed on until the time of her
death.
From an ID standpoint , she developed many bacteremias and GI
infections as previously discussed. The Infectious Disease Team
was involved in her care and there recommendations were followed
throughout her hospitalization. For the greater duration of her
ICU course , she was maintained on vancomycin , levofloxacin and
Flagyl on and off for multiple infections.
From an endocrine standpoint , she was maintained on her Synthroid dosing and
was on a CZI drip for blood sugar control throughout her ICU course.
Hematologically , the patient was transfused many many blood
products over the course of her ICU stay. She also developed
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent clots to her left
lower extremity requiring vascular surgery intervention. She had
embolectomy and thrombectomy of her left common femoral artery as
well as a left common femoral endarterectomy with patch
angioplasty on 3/13/06 .  She was maintained on bivalirudin and
Coumadin throughout her ICU course.
Given her preoperative status and multiple medical comorbidities as well as her
overall poor prognosis through many postsurgical complications , a family
meeting on 10/12/07 resulted in decision to withdraw support and provide
comfort measures only. At that time , tube feeds were stopped , hemodialysis was
stopped
and the patient was made comfortable with morphine until her
ultimate cardiac arrest at 0235 am on 1/16/07 .

Discharge Date: 3/18/2005
ATTENDING: SPILIAKOS , JODY DOMENIC MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute renal failure.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute on chronic renal failure.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Deglopper is a 63-year-old
male , stage III CHF and extensive past medical history notable
for hypertension , insulin-dependent diabetes and an MI , status
post CABG in 1989 and an unsuccessful catheterization in October
2005 , who presented following three days of oliguria. The
patient stated that for the last seven weeks , he has been
travelling on vocation , while he was awake , he noted decreased
dosages of many of his medicines specifically , he reduced his own
Lasix dose from 480 mg daily to 180 mg b.i.d. He also reduced
his Lotrel by half from 10 mg/40 mg to 5 mg/20 mg. He is also
taking Humalog 10 units , Lantus 45 units and Humulin 5 units. He
stated that his glucose levels were well controlled with blood
sugars less than 140. The patient reports that while he was
away , he felt as good as he has ever felt , was able to walk
greater than longer distances and over all felt much stronger.
However , he states that on Thursday night , he noticed that
instead of urinating as normal of 4-5 times per night , he was
found to only urinate 2-3 times. He did not urinate at all on
subsequent days and then put out merely a point of urine on the
day prior to admission. He reported that his urinary stream was
not the usual strength. He did not report dysuria or sensation
of being incomplete voiding. In addition , he noted that his
weight usually fluctuated approximately 4-6 pounds per day , but
that he had gained approximately 12 pounds since his oliguria
presented. He notes that his legs are swollen more than usual
and he denies chest pain , palpitations , or shortness or breath.
MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s medical history is notable for
CAD , status post CABG , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , CHF ,
obstructive sleep apnea , insulin-dependent diabetes and a hiatal
hernia.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , his vital signs were
stable with a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate of 60 , blood
pressure 90/50 and saturating 99% on room air. The patient was
an obese male. He was normocephalic and atraumatic with equal ,
round and reactive pupils. His hearing and vision were grossly
intact. His neck exam was significant for JVD of 8 cm. He had
no carotid bruits. His pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. He had a normal PMI. No right ventricular heave.
His rate and rhythm were normal. He had a normal S1 and S2.
Midsystolic and holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex 3 out
of 6. His abdomen was notable for multiple abdominal scars and a
large abdominal hernia. He had positive bowel sounds. His
abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were significant
for 1-2+ pitting edema to ankles. There was no erythema , warmth ,
or calf tenderness. His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
His significant labs on admission was hyponatremia , sodium of 130
and potassium of 2.9. A creatinine of 3.0 , BUN of 99 and a
glucose of 80. His white cells were 9.7. His hematocrit was
36.0. His platelet count was 212 , 000. His UA was negative. His
renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. No obstruction and a
left renal cyst. His chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. No
effusions or no evidence of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal. The patient&apos;s presentation consistent with acute on
chronic renal failure , which was attributed to low-effective
arterial blood volume and extensive cardiac history notable for
diastolic heart failure in addition to hypertension ,
atherosclerosis , most likely contributed to his chronic kidney
disease with a baseline creatinine in October 2005 of 1.6. He
was initially aggressively treated with diuresis with IV
furosemide on admission. His ACE inhibitor was held due to
increased renal perfusion. His urine output increased over his
initial two days of admission and his weight decreased from 261
pounds upon admission to 254 pounds , three days later. His
baseline weight prior to this episode of oliguria was 249 pounds.
His diurese were held per recommendations of the renal consult
team in order to allow for further decrease in his creatinine
before he was given them again. He continued diurese and began
his ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: During his hospital stay , Mr. Sperandio
experienced multiple episodes of his typical anginal symptoms as
well as a more pronounced episode of 10 out of 10 chest pain on
hospital day #3. During each event , the patient was noted to
have no significant EKG changes and his cardiac enzymes were
always negative. He underwent an echocardiographic exam during
this admission , which was essentially unchanged from his previous
echo on October of 2005. His ejection fraction had increased in
fact to 75%. There was minimal left ventricular hypertrophy. He
was continued on his regimen of isosorbide mononitrate 240 mg
p.o. q.a.m. , which actually was changed from 240 mg q.a.m. to 120
mg b.i.d. for more continuous coverage. He also received his
home regimen of aspirin , statins , Plavix and was started on
heparin for prophylaxis. In addition , his magnesium and
potassium were repleted as necessary. The patient continued his
home regimen of Lantus , Humalog and Regular Insulin by
fingersticks and then self-administering what he needed to
coverage levels. He continued his Synthroid for hypothyroidism
and his TSH was within normal limits during this admission. The
patient&apos;s discharge medications included aspirin 325 mg p.o.
daily , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily , Regular Insulin sliding
scale , which he self-administers , levothyroxine , sodium 50 mcg
p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d. , Humalog sliding scale , which
he administers to himself daily , Plavix 75 mg , p.o. daily , Lantus
45 units subcu q.p.m. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. daily , nitroglycerine
sublinguals p.r.n. for chest pain and Lotrel 5/20 mg p.o. daily ,
Imdur 240 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily. The
patient was discharged to home with followup appointment with Dr.
Stoss in 1-2 weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

SUMMARY: This is a 42-year-old morbidly obese female with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
complicated by BKA on two prior occasions , who was admitted to the
MICU with a BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Her hospital course by systems is as follows:
1. ENDOCRINE: As noted above , the patient
presented with BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.
She was placed on an insulin drip and hydrated with intravenous
fluids , with improvement. She was eventually transitioned to NPH
with insulin sliding scale coverage. Despite escalating her dose
of NPH up to 65 U subcu b.i.d. on the day of discharge , she
continued to have elevated blood sugars &gt;200 and required coverage
with insulin sliding scale. This issue will need to be addressed
as an outpatient.
2. PULMONARY: Posthydration , the patient was noted to have
increasing respiratory rates and O2 requirements and rales on exam.
As her creatinine had improved concurrent with hydration , she was
gently diuresed. An echocardiogram was obtained to assess her left
ventricular function in the context of her non-Q-wave MI , which was
notable for normal left ventricular function , with an EF of 50% ,
hypokinesis of the inferior septum , a right ventricle that was
mildly enlarged , with mildly decreased systolic function , normal
aortic valve , mild TR , and mild MR , and a pulmonary artery pressure
of 39 mm of mercury plus right atrial pressure consistent with
pulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion. With her body
habitus putting her at risk for DVT and PE , an echocardiogram which
showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension raised the concern for PE
being responsible for her symptoms of tachypnea and tachycardia. A
spiral CT was obtained that was nondiagnostic secondary to her body
habitus. A VQ scan was obtained , which was read as low probability
for PE. In addition , she also had negative LENIs. These studies
taken together alleviated the concern of PE or DVT in her. It was
felt that the patient likely had obstructive sleep apnea secondary
to her body habitus. She was maintained on CPAP during her
hospitalization stay; however , the patient informed the treating
team that she would not be using a CPAP machine once she returned
home secondary to the inconvenience and discomfort.
3. ID: On admission to MICU , given her positive urinalysis , she
was placed on cefotaxime for gram negative coverage. Both her
blood cultures and urine cultures grew out E. coli which were
sensitive to cefotaxime and gentamycin. As she initially continued
to be febrile and continued to have positive blood cultures , one
dose of gentamycin was given for synergy. Subsequently , she
improved. She remains on IV cefotaxime for the 7-day period that
she was in the MICU. On transfer to the floor , she was switched to
p.o. levofloxacin and will take 7 days of p.o. levofloxacin to
complete a total 14-day course of antibiotics for urosepsis.
4. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave MI by EKG
and enzymes. Her peak CK was 1200 , with a troponin of 1.52. She
was initially placed on aspirin , heparin , and a beta blocker. Once
her creatinine normalized , an ACE inhibitor was also added.
Heparin was discontinued once the concern for PE was alleviated.
Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up for a goal
systolic blood pressure of &lt;140 and a pulse of &lt;70. She was
transferred to the floor on hospital day 7 , where she remained
stable. Another guanosine MIBI was obtained , as the patient
reported that she would be unable to exercise , given her chronic
low back pain and sciatica. A planar study was done secondary to
her body habitus , which revealed a moderate sized area of prior
myocardial infarction throughout the mid LAD coronary territory ,
with moderate residual peri-infarct ischemia. The Cardiology
Service did not feel that the degree of this lesion warranted
catheterization , given the sizable risk of catheterization in her.
5. RENAL: On presentation , the patient had a creatinine of 2.1 ,
up from her baseline of 1.4. She was felt to have acute renal
failure , secondary dehydration , in the setting of diabetic
ketoacidosis. She was rehydrated and concurrent with this her
creatinine returned to her baseline and remained stable thereafter.
6. GI: On admission to the MICU , the patient was placed on GI
prophylaxis with Carafate. Once she was tolerating p.o.&apos;s , she was
placed on an ADA diet and her Carafate was discontinued prior to
discharge. Once transferred to the floor , the patient complained
of diarrhea; however , the nurses did not witness and were unable to
obtain a stool sample to check for C. diff toxin. Patient was
treated symptomatically with Imodium p.r.n. diarrhea. Prior to
discharge , the patient was counseled by the Nutrition Service
regarding an appropriate diabetic and coronary artery disease diet.
7. PAIN: On admission , the patient was on several pain medicines ,
including amitriptyline , Flexeril , and Valium for reported history
of sciatica and low back pain. On this hospitalization , these
medications were discontinued and she was placed on Neurontin for
likely diabetic neuropathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
NPH Humulin insulin 65 U subcu b.i.d. ,
human insulin sliding scale: for blood sugars 151-200 give 4 U ,
for blood sugars 201-250 give 6 U , for blood sugars 251-300 give 8
U , for blood sugars 301-350 give 10 U , Imodium 2 mg p.o. q. 6 hrs.
p.r.n. diarrhea , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150
one tab sublingual q. 5 min. x 3 p.r.n. chest pain , multivitamin
one tab p.o. q.d. , simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x 5 days , Toprol XL 400
mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Prior to discharge , the patient was evaluated by the
physical therapist , who noted her to walk around the
hospital Eldsche St , Lake Corp Ver , Alaska 29176 without significant problems. They felt that she
would be safe to discharge to home and did not need home PT , but
agreed that she would benefit from cardiac rehab , for which she was
referred. Patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9 , with
VNA , who will monitor her blood pressure , pulse , and blood sugar ,
and contact her PCP with any concerns or questions. She will
follow up with her PCP , Dr. Carmine Guillebeau , at WNDH in one week&apos;s
time , and she will follow up with Dr. Sammie Derobertis of cardiology
at Gons Landgilesnyton Dralvail in April .

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: PASCULLI , MONTY M. M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Acute coronary syndrome.
DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Includes the following; ST elevation
acute myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Post-MI pericarditis , mural
thrombus , type II diabetes mellitus , colonoscopy with colon
polypectomy in 1991 , hypercholesterolemia , status post umbilical
hernia repair , and questionable hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Scorzelli is
72-year-old female with a history of hypercholesterolemia , type
II diabetes mellitus , past smoking , and questionable
hypertension , but no known cardiac disease , who presented to this
hospital with vague epigastric pain/chest pain exacerbated by
deep inspiration and on lying flat. The pain persisted for more
than 48 hours , 10/10 in intensity and prevented her from sleep
finally leading to her presentation to the emergency department
on July , 2005 , where EKG showed Q waves in the anterior
leads with ST elevation in inferior leads II , III , and aVF. She
had elevated enzymes. Her troponin peaked to 20. A bedside
transthoracic echo showed anterior wall motion abnormality. She
was started on aspirin , heparin , Plavix , Integrilin , and
Lopressor , and the patient was taken to the catheterization lab
where she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD lesion and a hazy
90% lesion to the ramus. Two Cypher stents were deployed to the
LAD. The procedure is complicated by no-reflow phenomenon. One
Cypher stent was placed in the ramus branch. Right heart
catheterization revealed RA of 12 , RV 36/7 , PA 38/18 , and no
step-up in oxygenation in the right heart. The patient was
transferred to the CCU where her chest pain persisted. The pain
was positional , increased by deep inspiration and it was felt to
be likely post-MI pericarditis. Her EKG changes persisted , but
her enzymes clearly were trending downwards. The diagnosis of
post-MI pericarditis is consistent with echo findings showing
adhesions between the myocardium and pericardium. An
echocardiogram obtained after the percutaneous coronary
intervention showed an LVEF of 35%. The left ventricular size
was normal. The right ventricle was normal in size and the
thickness of the right ventricle was also normal. There was mild
tricuspid regurgitation. There was mild pericardial thickening
with the areas of adhesions at the pericardium near the apex and
there was a trivial pericardial effusion. Also , a mural sessile
thrombus was observed near the apex of the heart. Her EKG
changes continued to show ST elevation in lead II , III , aVF , V2
through V6 , Q waves in D2 , D3 , and aVF , and she also intermittent
right bundle-branch block morphology. She was treated for
ischemia with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers titrated to
achieve a pulse in the 70s to 80s. We did not increase it
further because of her low ejection fraction she was unlikely to
tolerate such high doses. She was started on aspirin and Plavix ,
which she continued for her myocardial function. She was placed
on eplerenone and Lasix to achieve a dry weight estimated to be
78 kilograms. This should be her goal weight. She has also been
receiving captopril , ACE inhibitors , for left ventricular
remodeling. Rhythm wise , there has been no arrhythmia noted on
telemetry on which she has been throughout her hospital stay.
For her pericarditis , she initially received 650 mg of aspirin 4
times a day. She was continued on this , but later the dose was
reduced as other anticoagulants were started. She was given
tramadol for her pain with improvement of her pericarditis pain.
Given her mural thrombus , she was anticoagulated initially with
heparin achieving the therapeutic PTT of 80 seconds
approximately. She was later bridged to Coumadin with a target
INR of 2. A higher INR should be avoided thus to avoid
hemopericardium. Endocrine wise , she was treated for her
diabetes with an insulin regimen that consists of Lantus and
Regular Insulin. A cardiac MRI was obtained on February , 2005 ,
with following findings. She had moderate to global left
ventricular dysfunction with basal to distal and anteroseptal
akinesis , apical akinesis , and distal inferior dyskinesis. Her
estimated EF was 38%. There is full-thickness delayed
enhancement of the myocardium indicating a 7th segment , out of
the total of 17 segments , myocardial infarction. There was a
large area of no-reflow within the myocardial infarction , which
is consistent with microvascular thrombosis. The distal or the
free wall is also hypokinetic raising the possibility of right
ventricular involvement from the myocardia l infarction. A
concentric moderate-sized pericardial effusion with exudative
features was also seen. The thickest area of the pericardial
effusion appears to be on the dependent aspect measuring 12 mm in
thickness. There is no right ventricular or right atrial
collapse or compression. Renal wise , she had no issues. Her
creatinine was always below 1 , mostly 0.7 or 0.8.
DISPOSITION: Her plan for disposition is to go to rehab. She
has been evaluated by physical therapy.
An addendum will be dictated with the current status of the
patient and her discharge medications at the time that she is
actually discharged from the hospital.

status post MI in 2001 status post an RCA stent at that time. It
was thought unlikely that the patient had flow-limiting coronary
artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient&apos;s chest pain was concerning for
flow-limiting coronary artery disease. The patient was continued
on aspirin and loaded with Plavix upon admission. The patient
was anticoagulated with 1 mg/kg doses of Lovenox q.12h. The
patient was started on a beta-blocker and given 80 mg of Lipitor.
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on
the day of admission , which showed a right dominant system with
no significant left main lesions. The patient did have a
proximal 90% LAD lesion as well as a proximal left circumflex
lesion estimated to be about 80%. The patient also had mid
circumflex lesion that was also estimated at 80%. The right
coronary artery had a proximal 50% diffuse lesion and a distal
40% tubular lesion. Right PDA had a tubular 90% lesion in the
mid portion as well as a 90% discrete lesion in the proximal PA.
As the patient was found to have three-vessel disease and a
history of diabetes , surgical revascularization was considered.
The patient was evaluated by the cardiothoracic surgical service
who discussed the case at length with the attending cardiologist
on service. In the end , it was decided by both the attending
cardiologist and the attending cardiothoracic surgeon in contact
with the patient and his wife that the best option at this time
was for percutaneous intervention as it was thought that the
patient would have significant difficulty postoperatively because
of his significant dementia. We felt that the patient would have
a difficult time with the necessary rehabilitation following CABG
and that percutaneous intervention would indeed be the best
option. Therefore , the patient underwent a repeat cardiac
catheterization. The patient had a Cypher stent placed to the
mid LAD lesion. The OM2 lesion was also stented with a Cypher
stent across the non-diseased ostium of OM1 and then the proximal
left circumflex lesion was also stented with a Cypher stent. The
final angiograms during this catheterization showed no residual
stenosis or dissection. The plan was for the patient to return
on an outpatient basis for potential percutaneous intervention to
the PDA/PLV and a stenting of the left renal artery which was
found to be stenotic and likely contributing to the patient&apos;s
refractory hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The patient
did well following his percutaneous interventions and he was
discharged on a regimen including aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , and
Zocor. The patient will follow up with Dr. Ruud in the
next few weeks for possible repeat percutaneous intervention.
Pump: The patient has no history of CHF. An echocardiogram
during this admission revealed moderate concentric LVH with basal
anterior septum basal inferior segment hypokinesis. Ejection
fraction was estimated at 60%. The patient remained euvolemic
for the remainder of the admission. The patient was continued on
his dose of ACE inhibitor. The patient has a long history of
refractory hypertension. The patient&apos;s hypertension was likely
exacerbated by a left renal artery stenosis found on his cardiac
catheterization. The patient was continued on his home blood
pressure regimen and additional agents were used as needed to
control his blood pressure. The patient was discharged on a
blood pressure regimen that include felodipine 10 mg p.o. once
daily , Toprol-XL 150 p.o. once daily , isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg
p.o. q.8h. , and Monopril 40 mg p.o. once daily. Of note , the
patient was on hydrochlorothiazide as an outpatient but this was
held as he recently received multiple doses of IV contrast. The
patient&apos;s hydrochlorothiazide can be restarted by his primary
care physician after ensuring that his creatinine is okay.
Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry during this
admission and had no issues.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease
with a baseline creatinine 1.3 to 1.6. The patient received
Mucomyst and sodium bicarbonate. Continue IV fluids in the peri
catheterization period. The patient&apos;s creatinine remained within
his baseline range throughout this admission. The creatinine at
the time of discharge was 1.5.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , which was
controlled with both insulin and oral agents. Oral agents were
held during this hospitalization and the patient was managed with
both long and short acting insulin. The patient&apos;s blood sugars
were well controlled and he was discharged on his home regimen
including metformin , glyburide , and nightly NPH.
4. Neurology: The patient has a history of dementia , which was
thought to be multiinfarct in nature. The patient did have
several episodes of agitation and sundowning during this
admission. The patient required medications to control these ,
rather he was oriented and spoke with his wife on several
occasions. The patient had a workup for reversible causes of
dementia including a TSH , B12 , and an RPR. The TSH and B12 were
within normal limits. The RPR was pending at the time of this
dictation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2. NPH 10 units subq daily at bedtime.
3. Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. q.8h.
4. Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab sublingual q.5 minutes x3 p.r.n.
chest pain.
5. Felodipine 10 mg p.o. once daily.
6. Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
7. Toprol-XL 150 mg p.o. once daily.
8. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Zocor 80 mg p.o. daily at bedtime.
10. Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. once daily.
11. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. once daily.
12. Monopril 40 mg p.o. once daily.
FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS: The patient was to follow up with Dr.
Sferra on 7/15/2006 at 11:00 a.m. at the Asi Hospital Care .  The patient is to follow up with his primary
care physician , Dr. Lovern , on 2/27/2006 at 8:30 a.m. at the Hosston Hospital as scheduled.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was discharged home with
services. The VNA was instructed to draw a BUN and creatinine on
1/27/06 and page Dr. Cody Amparo , pager number 36157 , with
the results. The VNA was also asked to reconcile the patient&apos;s
medication list with his discharge medication list and to clarify
any discrepancies with the patient&apos;s primary care physician , Dr.
Toby . Also , of note , the patient was instructed to discuss with
Dr. Sikkink the fact that his hydrochlorothiazide was held prior to
his discharge. Hydrochlorothiazide can be restarted provided the
patient&apos;s creatinine remains within his baseline range following
discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home with services in
stable condition.
CODE STATUS: The patient remained full code throughout this
entire admission.

Discharge Date: 8/26/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HYPERTENSION.
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING TIMES THREE
WITH RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY AND LEFT ANTERIOR
DESCENDING ARTERY ENDARTERECTOMY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 37-year-old
gentleman with known coronary artery
disease admitted for pre-coronary artery bypass grafting
evaluation. The patient&apos;s cardiac history dates back to the fall
of 1989 when the patient began to experience exertional angina.
The patient has been followed for his angina since that time.
Currently , the patient experiences angina at the end of most work
days. In light of his young age , he was referred for cardiac
catheterization and probable coronary artery bypass grafting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on 6/25/91 .  This showed severe triple vessel
disease with an essentially normal left ventricle. Thus , the
patient was taken to the Operating Room on 6/13/91 .  Under general
endotracheal anesthesia , the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with bilateral internal mammary
arteries. The left internal mammary was taken to the left anterior
descending and the right internal mammary artery was taken to the
right coronary artery. The saphenous vein graft was taken to the
first obtuse marginal branch. The patient was found to have
extremely pronounced atherosclerosis of his coronary arteries.
There were no apparent complications and the patient was taken to
the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. Postoperatively , the
patient had an entirely smooth postoperative course. He was
maintained on low molecular weight Dextran for 48 hours for his
endarterectomy. The patient was started on enteric coated aspirin
on the first day of his operation. The patient was extubated and
all his chest tubes and mediastinal tubes were removed. The
patient diuresed very well and was started on beta blockers. The
patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia for
the entire postoperative course.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Tenormin , 75 mg
po q day; enteric coated aspirin , one po q day; Carafate , 1 gram po
q.i.d.; iron sulfate , 325 mg po q day; Percocet and Colace.

ATTENDING: BRADLEY FRIEDRICHSEN M.D.
DIAGNOSIS: Left calcaneus osteomyelitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Kubly is a 61-year-old
gentleman with type II diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
peripheral neuropathy and hypertension who presents for
evaluation of a longstanding left heel ulcer and presumed
calcaneus osteomyelitis. He also has had multiple surgeries in
the past as well as hyperbaric oxygen and has been refractory to
these treatments. He has had a recent flare in 3/16 and has
been treated at Eltham Medical Center .  At that time the wound grew
out methicillin resistant staph aureus and e. coli. These
organisms have been treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. However ,
an MRI at that time was thought to be consistent with
osteomyelitis. The patient presented for treatment of this
issue.
Additionally , the patient has had some left shoulder pain and was
admitted at Otjo Goldtion Hospital on 1/26/2003 . There was concern for
sepsis at the sternoclavicular joint or perhaps at the
glenohumeral joint. The patient had an MRI at the outside
hospital which is not available to us but was concerning for some
abnormal process at the sternoclavicular joint. The patient
states he still has some shoulder pain that localizes to the
sternoclavicular joint. This seems to be improving over time.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left heel ulcer and calcaneal
osteomyelitis , BPH status post TURP in 1984 , insulin diabetes
mellitus , hypertension , coronary artery disease status post an MI
in 1991 , cataracts.
ALLERGIES: To codeine.
MEDICATIONS: The patient takes insulin NPH 40 q.a.m. and 30
q.p.m. , Humalog 20 in the morning 60 at night , Norvasc 5 once a
day , Allopril ( sp? ) 40 once a day , Prilosec 20 once a day , K-Dur
10 once a day , Lasix 40 once a day , enteric coated aspirin 80
once a day , Protonix 40 once a day , Reglan 5 twice a day , Xanax
0.25 q.h.s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs on admission are
stable with a temperature of 98.4. A pleasant gentleman. Clear
lungs. Heart regular rhythm. Abdomen soft and nontender. Left
heel has a 1.5 cm ulcer on the posterior aspect that appears to
tract deep to bone. He has generalized decreased neuropathy in
the foot and minimal EHL or FHL. He has 5/5 _____ with limited
range of motion at the ankle.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: White count of 6 , hematocrit of
30 , sed rate of 111.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital for
evaluation and treatment of his calcaneous osteomyelitis. An MRI
was obtained which was read with a bone radiologist and
consistent with osteomyelitis. The patient was taken for
debridement to the operating room , after preoperative clearance
by the medicine team , for debridement of calcaneal osteomyelitis
on 7/6/2003 ( see _____ of the procedure ). Postoperatively the
patient was continued on Vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl per
the infectious disease recommendations. The cultures from the
primary debridement ( in which the wound was able to be closed )
was methicillin resistant staph aureus.
The patient did well inhouse. His wound to the foot was changed
while inhouse and looked intact , clean and dry without drainage.
The drain was removed on postoperative day #4.
Regarding the patient&apos;s left sternoclavicular joint , CT scan was
obtained which was concerning for infection at the
sternoclavicular joint. An MRI was obtained to better image the
area and to determine whether or not there is some involvement of
the clavicle. On the CT scan there was no obvious collection
amenable to surgical decompression. At the time of this
dictation the MRI was pending.
The patient had also had a preoperative consult with the Plastic
Surgery team but this was not necessary at the patient&apos;s wound
was able to be closed in the OR. Additionally , vascular studies
were obtained which were read as excellent PVRs preoperatively.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with the Infectious
Disease team as well as primary care physician as well as
Orthopedic Surgery team and Dr. Talburt one week after discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Per the ID record , Vancomycin 1 gram
q.24h as well as gatifloxacin 200 mg once a day. The patient
will continue his home medicines.
LABS: Labs will be checked once per week by the primary care
physician.
WEIGHTBEARING: The patient will be tested on weightbearing of
the left lower extremity.

1 )C/V
+I- Pt was R/OMI&apos;ed with all three sets negative for ischemia. This was
to examine for causes of CHF exacerbation. Pt was continued on her home
rx of betablocker , asa , statin
+P- Pt normotensive. Likely fluid
overloaded given CXR , physical exam , and HPI. Pt was diuresed with IV
Lasix in the ED. On the floor she received 2.5mg of Metolazone followed
by 60mg of Torsemide. She was then diuresed with 5mg of Metolazone
followed by 120mg of Torsemide. She was roughly negative 1.3L. Pt was
doing clinically well when on 4/23 pt&apos;s Cr increased to 3.2 from her
baseline of about 2.5. At that time Torsemide and Metolazone were held.
Pt&apos;s daily weights continued to decrease even off of diuretics. On 3/4 ,
however pt&apos;s weight increased to 72.9 kg from 70.6kg. At this time pt was
restarted on her home rx of torsemide 20mg po bid. A repeat weight was
checked in the pm returning as 71.7kg. Pt was discharged on 3/4 at a
weight of 158 lbs.
of discharge pt was at or better than her baseline function in terms of
her orthopnea/SOB.
+R- During her stay the patient remained in afib with good rate control
on her bblocker.
2 ) Heme: Pt was found to be supertheraputic during her stay. Her coumadin
was held throughout her admission as her INR remained 3.9 to 4.0 in the
setting of hemoptysis. On
discharge pt was started on 1/2 her home coumadin with VNA/PCP f/u in 2
days. Pt d/ced on Coumadin 1mg qpm.
3 ) ID- Pt had a negative UA and urine CTX. However during her admission pt
developed diarrhea. Because of concern for c.diff colitis. Pt recieved an
abdominal CT. CT showed no colitis but did show a LLL consolidation likely
PNA. Pt was initially treated with azithromycin but as her cough and o2
requirement did not improve , as well as because pt began to spike fevers ,
pt was begun on ceftaz and levo for gram pos coverage ( levo ) double gram
neg coverage , and atypical coverage ( levo ) for presumed hospital aquired
PNA in the setting of pt&apos;s multiple hosp for CHF exacerbation this year.
PT improved clinically and was d/ced on levofloxacin 500mg q48h x 7 days
and ceftaz changed to cefpodoxime 200mg po qd x 7 days.
Pt&apos;s diarrhea was concerning for c.diff given fever and high whitecount.
however pt had only been on azithromycin x 1 day. Cdiff , fecal leuks , and
all stool studies were negative during admission. Presumed viral
gastroenteritis. Pt started on loperamide before discharge to be continued
prn diarrhea.
4 ) Endocrine - Pt&apos;s po DM rx were held during her admission - she was
covered with Lantus and Insulin Asp SS. HgA1c was sent and was in nl
range. Home po rx were restarted on
discharge. Pt was kept on her home dose of levoxyl; TSH was rechecked
and within nl range. Pt&apos;s home rx Allopurinol was also continued.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: ZOGG , RAYMOND RANDALL MD
DISCHARGE DATE:
Presumed to be 10/9/05 .
PRIMARY ONCOLOGIST:
Antoine Petchulis , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Pain secondary to a lytic lesion in the right hip.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
Recurrent lymphoma , pulmonary dysfunction secondary to
chemotherapy and obesity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
In brief , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
diagnosed approximately eight years ago who has been treated in
the past with CVP and CHOP/Rituxan. She underwent high-dose
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in 6/22 .  Her
transplant was complicated by worsening of her baseline impaired
lung function , and she has been oxygen dependent since the time
of transplant. In 4/9 , she began to have back pain and
eventually was shown to have recurrent or increasing disease in
the retroperitoneum by abdominal CT ( paraaortic at the level of
L2 ). The decision was made to pursue radiation therapy to this
area , which she completed on 10/4/05 . The patient presented
with complaints of pain in the mid lower back radiating in a
band-like distribution around the waist to the abdomen as well as
into the right hip and buttock area. The pain also radiated into
the right thigh with movement for weightbearing. The patient
reports the pain was occasionally associated with numbness in the
right lateral thigh. She denied any radiation of the pain to
below the knee. She denied any numbness in the lower legs , back
or saddle area. She denied any change in bowel or bladder
function.
The patient had fluoroscopic LP on 6/18/05 with a glucose of 69 ,
a total protein of 49.3 , and cytology which was negative. Plain
films of her hip showed enthesopathy of the superior pelvis
bilaterally , lower lumbar spine degeneration , and sclerotic focus
in the proximal region of the right femur. MRI of the lumbar
spine on 8/5/05 showed an irregular soft tissue mass within the
retroperitoneum centered anterior to the spine at the level of
L2 , position posterior to the IVC and right lateral aorta
measuring 4.5 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm; there is a lesion involving the
anterior superior aspect to the L2 vertebral body continuous with
the anterior paraspinal mass with wedging and probable pathologic
compression fracture. No epidural mass.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Recurrent lymphoma.
2. Pulmonary function thought to be due in part to BCNU
chemotherapy , currently on 5 liters home O2.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.
4. Obesity.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
1. Prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily.

diagnosed with uterine cancer , coronary artery disease , and
diabetes.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her husband in Holl Cho Shing She denies tobacco and alcohol. She has four grown
children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
Vitals: Temperature 97.6 , heart rate 91 , blood pressure 140/90 ,
respiratory rate 22 , oxygen saturation 97% on 5 liters. In
general , the patient was found to be alert and oriented x3 with
difficulty standing secondary to pain and habitus. HEENT:
Pupils were equally round and reactive to light. Normal sclerae ,
normal conjunctivae. Extraocular movements were intact. Moist
mucous membranes and clear oropharynx. Neck: No
lymphadenopathy , no thyromegaly. Pulmonary: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with some wheeze at the right base.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Morbid obesity , nontender ,
normoactive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. Back: Mild
paraspinal tenderness bilaterally. Extremities: Bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neuro: 2/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the left; distal neuropathy.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
At the time of admission , white cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 35.5 ,
platelets 249. INR 2.1 , PTT 45.8. BMP showed a sodium of 139 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 19 , creatinine
0.6 , glucose 126. LFTs were within normal limits. UA showed 2+
bacteria but no white cells.
In general , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
who presented for workup of lower back pain recurring status post
XRT to the lumbar spine region.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Oncology: CT of the thoracic , lumbar , and sacral spine on
8/18/05 showed no evidence of cord compression but did show a
compression fracture at L2. IR was consulted on 4/18/05
regarding the possibility of kyphoplasty to this area; however ,
they deferred further treatment , as the pain was thought to be
secondary to hip pathology rather than lumbar spine pathology.
CT of the right hip on 4/18/05 showed a lytic lesion in the
posterior acetabulum with an associated fracture. The patient
was evaluated by Orthopedic Oncology as well as Radiation
Oncology. Dr. Cestia with Orthopedic Oncology deferred any
surgical intervention until the completion of radiation therapy.
The patient started radiation therapy to the right hip on
3/29/05 . The contact in Radiation Oncology is Britt L Redden , M.D. , pager number 28468. The plan is for the
patient to complete a course of 18 treatments of radiation to the
right hip. The patient will then have a repeat CT of the right
hip in one month&apos;s time and follow up with Dr. Saralegui . She has an
appointment to meet with Dr. Strief on 9/8/05 at 2:45 p.m. Per
recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology and Physical Therapy , the
patient is to be touched down weightbearing on the right leg
( toes only ) and full weightbearing on the left leg. It is
expected that she should be able to undergo physical therapy with
the use of a walker. She should be kept on posterior hip
precaution with limitation of hip flexion and internal rotation
of the right hip.
2. Pain: The patient was seen by the Pain Service during this
hospitalization. Her current pain regimen includes methadone 5
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and 100 mg p.o.
q.8. a.m. and q. noon , MSIR 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. as well as 15-30 mg
q.2h. as needed. The patient was also started on Decadron 10 mg
p.o. q.a.m. given her initial concern for spinal cord
compression. She has been tapering off of the Decadron and will
be discharged on 4 mg p.o. q.a.m. with taper as listed in the
discharge instructions. Once the patient has completed Decadron
2 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 doses , she should then be started on
prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily per her home dosing for pulmonary
disease. The patient did receive pamidronate 90 mg IV x1 during
this hospitalization.
3. ID: UA on admission was more or less benign , and urine
culture remained negative. The patient was afebrile throughout
her hospitalization. She was given a five-day course of
acyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times per day for concern of recurrent
genital herpes. Given continued complaints of vaginal itching ,
the patient was given fluconazole 150 mg x1 on 10/17/05 to treat
a presumed yeast infection.
4. GI: The patient has a history of constipation secondary to
use of pain medication. She has been having good bowel movement
on MiraLax , Senna , Colace. She has also writing for Dulcolax
p.r.n. for constipation.
5. Heme: The patient is on Coumadin given a recent history of
DVT. She had an INR of 3.7 two days prior to admission , so her
dosing was reduced during this hospitalization. Her INR has been
stable and is at 2.3 at the time of discharge on dosing of 4.5 mg
p.o. q.h.s.
6. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient has a pulmonary
dysfunction with a home O2 requirement of 5 liters. She has been
stable on this home O2 requirement throughout this
hospitalization. She does require CPAP at night for obstructive
sleep apnea.
7. Cardiovascular: No known history of cardiovascular disease.
Echo on 1/28/04 showed an EF of 55%.
8. Endo: The patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin
while on Decadron. It is intended that this should be stopped
when the Decadron taper has finished.
9. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient had some
hypocalcemia during this hospitalization. She was started on
Tums 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , with good response. She was also given
pamidronate x1 as listed above.
CODE:

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: hypotension at home
*****************
HPI: 67M w/recent FH admit for fluid overload in the setting of chronic
kidney disease and dietary salt load. He was sent home on higher doses
of his BP meds as well as the addition of HCTZ to his home lasix dose.
He was also sent home on a 10 day course of cipro for a foley-associated
UTI. He did well until the day of admission when he felt tired , checked
his BP himself at home and found it was 86/41 , so he called his doctor
who directed him the the ER. He denies SOB , COP , orthopnea , PND , N/V ,
abdominal pain , or cough. He has had loose stools x 3 days which he
believes is because the VNA increased his stool softeners. In the ED his
BP was 91/60 with a pulse of 60 and he got 1L fluid.

IMPRESSION: 68M with fluid-reponsive hypotension in setting of recent
aggressive diuresis and blood pressure medicine augmentation.
1 ) CV( p ): Mr. Axtell was felt to be hypotensive from being dry in the
setting of overdiuresis and increased stool output. His BP was fluid
responsive to 1L in the ED , after which he was able to maintain oral
hydration. His diuretics were held during his hospital stay and his
lasix will need to be resumed once he begins to put on water weight ( he
may not need the HCTZ , as the synergy of the two diuretics appears to
have been too much for him ). His ARB was held in the setting of his
acute on chronic renal failure and will also need to be resumed once his
creatinine improves to his baseline. His labetalol dose was also reduced
to allow him to mount a heart rate response to hypotension. His
nifedipine dose stayed the same. He was tolerating a regimen of
labetalol 100mg PO twice a day and nifedipine 120mg PO once a day on
discharge , with systolic blood pressures in the 120-130s.
2 ) RENAL: as noted above , the patient appeared to be in acute on
chronic renal failure from overdiuresis. He continued to make good
urine output ( 1-2L per day ) and his creatinine trended downward. His
ARB was held but will need to be restarted as an outpatient.
3 ) DM: he was maintained on his home regimen of lantus 48 , aspartate qac
and slide scale. He was on a renal , cardiac , diabetic diet.
FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Mr. Deasy : your lasix , hydrocholorthiazide , and irbesartan were
stopped. Your doctor will tell you when to restart the irbesartan
( avapro ). Please weigh yourself daily and restart your lasix 80mg once a
day if you gain more than 2 pounds.
2 ) Mr. Pocasangre : your labetalol is now 100mg twice a day ( was 200mg twice a
day ).
3 ) VNA: please check Mr. Outhouse blood pressure , heart rate , and weight
twice a week and call or fax results to PCP.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) Please note the following medicines were stopped in the setting of
medicine related hypotension: lasix and hydrochlorothiazide. Please
resume as needed.
2 ) Please note the following medicine was held in the setting of acute
renal failure from dehydration: irbesartan. Please resume when
creatinine has returned to patient&apos;s baseline.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 63-year-old female
with multiple medical problems admitted 10/30/06 after
ventricular VFib arrest with AICD discharge and associated fall
on Coumadin. Current mental status limits history but per prior
notes , the patient fell on 11/19/06 with loss of consciousness
for two or three minutes after feeling dizzy. She presented to
the Emergency Department on 10/30/06 with complaints of 8/10
headaches; the RN at the assisted living facility
suggested that she be evaluated immediately postfall. The
patient complains of confusion postfall , lasting until
presentation. She denied nausea or vomiting. Headache had been
constant since fall. Also , complains of right knee pain that was
worse with ambulation. Head CT noted intracranial hemorrhage ,
subdural hemorrhage and small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Her INR
at that time was 3.3. She was admitted to the MICU on the
Neurosurgical Service from 10/30/06 to 10/17/06 without operative
intervention. She received factor VII , multiple units of FFP ,
and subcutaneous vitamin K for elevated INR. She was empirically
started on seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin and Keppra , followed
closely by Neurology and a continuous EEG monitoring. ICU course
was notable for slowly rising LFTs ascribed to Dilantin ,
worsening acute on chronic renal failure , congestive heart
failure with volume overload and persistent encephalopathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Again is significant for diabetes
mellitus , gout , history of DVTs , lumpectomy followed by
mastectomy for breast cancer in 2004 , chronic renal failure;

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO FLOOR: Vital signs ,
temperature 96 , pulse 68 , blood pressure 140/70 , respiratory rate
18 , oxygen saturation 100% on room air. She was somnolent ,
seated in a chair , responding to voice , answers single questions
appropriately , but was intermittently requiring painful stimuli
for arousal. Head and neck exam , sclerae were anicteric. JVP
was difficult to assess secondary to jaw movement and tooth
grinding. Cardiovascular exam , regular rate and rhythm , 2/6

to auscultation bilaterally in both lung fields. Abdomen was
distended and tympanic. Nonpitting edema of the extremities.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable. Neurologically , she
occasionally answers questions , was alert and oriented x3 when
awake , followed command intermittently , tracking when awake.
Neurological assessment was difficult due to lack of the patient
cooperation. On her skin , there were no gross lesions.

regurg , dilated and nonpulsatile IVC. Chest x-ray on 10/30/06 PA
and lateral showed stable cardiac enlargement with prominent
septa interstitium , no evidence of pulmonary vascular edema. AP
chest x-ray on 1/18/06 appear unchanged from prior imaging with
stable mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral airspace

asymmetric pulmonary edema. The right cardiac pacemaker device
overlies the chest wall on the right with a single terminating in
the right ventricle. No pneumothorax was visualized. Right
upper quadrant sono 10/30/06 , hepatic cirrhosis , limited
evaluation of gallbladder due to contraction , but no classic
Murphy sign. 7/12/06 , right upper quadrant ultrasound showed
thickened gallbladder wall and gallbladder sludge , small amount
of ascites , trace to small right pleural effusion. CT scan of
the head on 10/30/06 showed 1.7 x 2 cm intraparenchymal
hemorrhage within the right temporal lobe suspicious for
hemorrhagic metastasis. Given additional smaller areas of high
attenuation within the left parietal lobe. A component of which
appears were arachnoid and right convexity also suspicious for
metastatic disease. Hemorrhage likely subarachnoid within the
quadrigeminal plate cistern on the right extending along the
tentorium. 10/30/06 , repeat head CT no significant interval
change in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right
temporal lobe suspicious for hemorrhagic metastasis. 7/6/06
head CT with gadolinium unchanged parenchymal and subarachnoid
hemorrhage. 1/18/06 CT of head , slight interval decrease in
size of left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage , which was small ,
unchanged intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right
temporoparietal region. Stable hemorrhoids within the
quadrigeminal cistern. CT of C-spine on 10/30/06 , no dramatic
bony fracture of the cervical spine , partially imaged right
temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Plain of right knee ,
10/30/06 , findings consistent with osteoarthritis most marked
within the medial compartment , moderate joint effusion , no
radiographic evidence of acute displaced fracture.
IMPRESSION: A 63-year-old woman with traumatic contusion ,
subdural hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage now
encephalopathic with hepatotoxicity and acute on chronic renal
insufficiency with volume overload in the setting of longstanding
cardiomyopathy.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Neuro: Intracranial hemorrhage status post fall. The patient
followed by Neurology and Neurosurgery. Started on antiepileptic
prophylaxis in the setting of ICH , no tapering on Dilantin.
Also , on Keppra 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. which was adjusted for renal
failure. The patient has been on continuos EEG monitoring with
right PLEDs though no frank seizure activity. All AEDs was
stopped and with continuing EEG monitoring , encephalopathy of
unclear etiology , hepatic source versus bleed related hemorrhage
versus medication. The patient was able to ambulate at baseline ,
frequently falls asleep but was always easy to arouse and
talkative to the daughter. On the date of discharge , she was
conversant , alert and oriented x3 and significantly improved in
mental status relative to time of presentation. To follow up
with Dr. Phillip Arrequin of Neurosurgery in one month.
Cardiovascular: History of coronary artery disease , no
significant evidence of acute event by cardiac enzymes to explain
VFib. 1/18/06 echo with EF of 25% unchanged from July 2005.
She remained on standing torsemide twice a day , status post VFib
arrest. She was followed by EP on overall amiodarone taper and
telemetry.
Pulmonary: Stable on nasal cannula , though with frequent benefit
from diuresis as needed.
Hematologically , the patient received 3 doses of vitamin K from
admission through 1/18/06 . Received multiple FFP transfusions
to maintain INR less than 1.4. Coumadin was held in the setting
of her recent bleed. Question of anticoagulation to be
readdressed with Dr. Stwart in one month. She received subcutaneous
heparin for DVT prophylaxis , which was okayed by Neurosurgery.
ID: The patient received a course of ciprofloxacin for UTI.
Renal: Acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency consistent with
relative prerenal state in the setting of volume overload. The
patient was diuresed with torsemide and metolazone.
GI: The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet though with
only scant p.o. intake at first. The patient progressed to
tolerate p.o. intake and when her mental status had improved she
was requesting meals on her own. LFTs were intermittently
elevated with a peak bili of 4 , peak AST of 111 , ALT of 90.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound remained unremarkable , though
beyond gallbladder sludge. The elevated LFTs were attributed to
be most likely due to Dilantin. The patient was maintained on
standing lactulose to relieve encephalopathy.
Endocrine: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient was
maintained on Lantus as she was outpatient and as well as regular
doses of Regular Insulin on a sliding scale. She had episodic
hypoglycemia at the initial stages of hospital course and
progressed to a more chronic mild hyperglycemia in the 200 to 300
range with further adjustment of her insulin dosage.
Orthopedic: Her right knee pain status post fall. Despite of
the right knee pain , after the fall , there was no evidence of
acute injury and she received supportive care. She continued to
receive heparin prophylaxis and was maintained on pneumoboots for
DVT prophylaxis.
The patient was full code status throughout entire hospital
course.

BRIEF ADMISSION HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Chirico is a 50-year-old male with a history of Hep-C and NASH
cirrhosis who was transferred from the outside hospital with
presumed hepatic encephalopathy after being found unresponsive in
his apartment. Of note , the patient has been in the ED two days
prior to admission on 3/17/2007 for abdominal pain and
distention , at which time labs were within normal limits ,
including no white count , LFTs , but he did have ammonia of 81.
Plan was for paracentesis , but the patient refused and he left
AMA before follow up with his GI doctor could be arranged. His
family was unable to contact him on the evening on 6/11/2007 . A
friend was sent and checked him out in the following morning on
1/13/2006 and the patient was found alone in his apartment and
unresponsive. He was taken to the Charl Lubspi Hospital by EMS on 10/28/2007 , and the patient was tachycardic and
febrile to 100.2 , and only able to open eyes to commands ,
otherwise noncommunicative per report. A diagnostic and
therapeutic paracentesis of 4 liters was performed , which was
negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 80&apos;s post-paracentesis and he had
elevated cardiac enzymes with troponin of 0.49. The patient&apos;s
course at the outside hospital was also complicated by UTI ,
status post two days or ciprofloxacin and an acute renal failure
in the setting of diuresis ( creatinine rising from 0.8 and 1.5 ).
Given the patient&apos;s extensive history of cardiac/GI treatment at
the Systems/leaj Memorial Hospital , he was transferred to the Nonwelle Geshall Hospital Of on 4/8/2007 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Undergoing liver transplant
workup. HAV , HCV reactive. HBV negative. Smooth muscle
antibody positive. Large volume ascites with multiple
paracenteses from 3/29 through 8/13 .  Liver biopsied on
8/12 with portal mononuclear inflammation ,

2. CAD , status post stent: Cardiac cath done 3/16/2006
revealed proximal LAD with ostial 90% disease , 50% ??____?? LIMA
touchdown , 90% ostial left circumflex , totally occluded RCA ,
patent LIMA to LAD and patent SVG to PDA and radial to diagonal ,
but radial graft to OM was totally occluded. He had a bare-metal
stent placed to left circumflex lesion.
3. Status post CABG in 4/17 with LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA ,
renal graft to OM and diagonal. Asymptomatic since CABG , but in
workup for liver transplant , the patient was found to have
elevated troponin and taken to cath as above.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: On transfer , Mr. Davern is alert and
oriented , but still very confused with limited verbal
communication. Baseline ammonia on 1/26/2007 was 66. He was
continued on lactulose and rifaximin , which were titrated to a
goal to 3-4 bowel movements per day. During his hospitalization ,
the patient was noncompliant with lactulose regimen due to
confusion and had two episodes of decreased responsiveness. During these
episodes , there were no EKG or ABG changes suspicious for ischemia or
hypercapnia or hypoxia. Given his agitation , the patient was placed on
restraints after which
his mental status improved , inflicting a possible voluntary and
metabolic component is decompensation. He was able to contract
with healthcare team as his mental status improved and continued
to be compliant with his regimen. At discharge , he continues to
be alert and oriented , appropriately interactive , and an
ammonia of 16. Plans were to follow up with Dr. Chhuon for
continued evaluation of his possible liver transplant and
management of his hepatic encephalopathy. He should continue on
his lactulose regimen and rifaximin.
2. Ascites: Mr. Angeles &apos;s intake weight was 225 pounds. He
underwent diagnostic therapeutic paracenteses x4. The first two
and fourth procedures removed 6 liters while the third procedure
removed 1.2 liters. Before and after each tap , the patient was
infused with IV albumin at 8 g/liter of ascites fluid removed.
Analysis of ascites fluid showed a SAAG of 1.4 , 2.7 , 3 , and 2.8
respectively , which is consistent with portal hypertension. The
ascites fluid was also negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. Following each procedure , Mr. Records remained
hemodynamically stable with blood pressures of 80-90/40-50. His
blood pressure and weights remained stable following
paracentesis , reflecting limited reaccumulation fluid.
Discharge weight is 299.9 pounds. He should continue on
diuretics to maintain his ascites at a reasonable level including
Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Renal insufficiency: Lasix and Aldactone were initially
started on Mr. Selim &apos;s stay at the KVGH , but they were
discontinued after increasing in serum creatinine from baseline
of 0.8 to 1.4 at the time of transfer. The patient&apos;s renal
insufficiency was likely secondary to hypotension with consequent
renal hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound at the outside hospital
was negative. Following transfer , Mr. Dayhoff was given empiric
hydration challenge with IV normal saline and albumin. He proved
responsive to this treatment with creatinine dropping from 1.4
to 1.1. He was restarted on Lasix 20 mg p.o. and Aldactone 50 mg
p.o. , and gradually titrated up to a discharge dose of Lasix 80
mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. daily. His serum
creatinine has remained stable at 0.7 to 0.9. He will follow up
with Dr. Averbeck .
4. Hypotension: Mr. Boger had been hypotensive at the outside
hospital following paracentesis with normal saline placement.
His regimen of lisinopril and nifedipine were consequently held
and discontinued. Given his systolic blood pressures of 80&apos;s to
90&apos;s , nadolol was also discontinued at the time of transfer.
Throughout his current hospitalization , Mr. Veroeven &apos;s blood
pressures have remained stable in the 80-90/40-50.
5. Troponin leak: Mr. Swogger &apos;s troponin leak at the outside
hospital is likely due to hypovolemic hypoperfusion. He was
continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor at the outside hospital
as he has status post stents and CABG. At the time of transfer ,
his troponin had decreased from 0.49 to 0.15. He has maintained
on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor , remained stable and asymptomatic
throughout the stay. A repeat troponin performed on 1/26/2007
was less than 0.1 ( less than assay ).
6. UTI: Mr. Couvertier had positive urinalysis at the outside
hospital. He was treated with 3-day course of Cipro. A
urinalysis performed during this admission was negative.
7. Guaiac-positive stool: Likely secondary to straining ,
esophageal , and anorectal varices. The patient&apos;s hematocrit had
been stable at 35 to 43. At discharge , recommended workup in EGD
as an outpatient with Dr. Graniela .
8. Contact dermatitis: On hospital day #9 , the patient
developed a contact dermatitis on inner aspect of his thighs ,
thought to be secondary to his urinary and fecal incontinence.
He was treated with topical hydrocortisone and miconazole. He
also developed an infected skin tag on his back , which was
treated with topical bacitracin. These should be continued to be
treated at rehab and followed up by his PCP.
9. Diabetes mellitus: Throughout his hospitalization , Mr.
Lynne blood glucose levels were well controlled with
fingerstick showing blood sugars to 100 to 190. The patient&apos;s
metformin and Avandia were held and he was started on insulin
sliding scale , but required minimal coverage. At discharge from
rehab , he should be restarted on his p.o. regimen of Avandia and
metformin. He will follow up with his PCP , Dr. Orizetti .
10. Heme: On admission , INR was 1.7 , likely due to decreased
synthetic function of his liver. He was given a 3-day course of
vitamin K with a good response. At the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s
INR was 1.6.
11. Code status: Full code.
12. Disposition: To rehab.

Discharge Date: 4/23/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. NON-HODGKIN&apos;S LYMPHOMA.
2. HODGKIN&apos;S DISEASE , STATUS POST MECHLORETHAMINE , VINCRISTINE ,
PROCARBAZINE , AND PREDNISONE CHEMOTHERAPY TEN YEARS AGO.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. STATUS POST TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Three days of shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kayser is an African American
female who is 72 years of age with a
history of Hodgkin&apos;s disease status post MOPP chemotherapy , and
more recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma for which she
is being treated with CHOP chemotherapy. She was tolerating the
chemotherapy without complications until developing symptoms of
fatigue as well as shortness of breath over a three to four day
period prior to admission. In July 1997 , Ms. Vanzile presented to
the Oncology Clinic with a biliary obstruction that was shown to be
a peripancreatic mass and a left subclavicular lymph node. Biopsy
of the subclavicular lymph node revealed non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma ,
for which she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy. Given her
previous exposure to Adriamycin for treatment of Hodgkin&apos;s disease
ten years previously , the patient&apos;s cardiac function was followed
and serial echocardiograms over the past six months. The previous
three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy were complicated with a
peripancreatic abscess which was treated with intravenous then oral
antibiotics with good resolution. She , subsequently , three more
cycles of CHOP chemotherapy and was in near complete remission by
gallium scan; however , a persistent abdominal mass was still
detected on Computerized Tomography scan. Her therapy was stopped
after five cycle of CHOP due to the maximum Adriamycin dose of 460
mg/m2. The patient was being restaged and was found to develop
acute shortness of breath over the weekend , denying any chest pain ,
nausea or vomiting , or light-headedness. The patient denies any
changes in her activities except for becoming more tired with
exertion and wakening up suddenly the night prior to admission
feeling short of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes Non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma , Hodgkin&apos;s
disease , hypertension , and a total abdominal
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed , well-nourished
elderly woman who is able to speak complete
sentences , but with some difficulty. Her vital signs were a heart
rate of 140; respiration rate of 32 to 36. Oxygen saturation of
92% on room air and is afebrile. The neck examination revealed a
jugular venous pressure of 8 centimeters. No thyromegaly or
lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Chest examination revealed
bilateral lower lobe rales , no rhonchi or wheezes were appreciated.
Coronary examination revealed tachycardic rate and rhythm with a
positive S3. The abdomen was benign. There is no edema at the
lower extremities.
LABORATORY: Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at 130 ,
normal axes and intervals. No ST or T wave changes.
Her profile-7 is remarkable for a potassium of 3.3 , otherwise
unremarkable. The patient has an elevated LDH. Cholesterol level
was 243 and elevated triglyceride level of 197. Complete blood
count was significant for an elevated white count of 11 , 600;
hematocrit of 39.9 with an MCV of 91.2; and platelet count of
131 , 000. There was a normal differential of the complete blood
count. Her coags are also within normal parameters. The
urinalysis was benign.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem number one is the patient&apos;s shortness of
breath. Given the acute onset of shortness of
breath and dyspnea upon exertion , causes contributing to the change
in pulmonary status included pulmonary embolism , congestive heart
failure , and pneumonia. Of note , the patient&apos;s chest x-ray
revealed bilateral pleural effusions. However , the patient was
afebrile. Therefore , our suspicion for pneumonia was low. The
patient received an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.
The echocardiogram on June , 1997 , revealed a mildly enlarged
ventricle with moderately decreased systolic function. Estimated
ejection fraction was 30%. Global hypokinesis was identified along
with a marked significant involvement of the apex as well as the
anterior septal and inferior regions of the heart. Normal right
ventricular systolic function was observed. Also noted is that
there was a small pericardial effusion with an elevated PA pressure
of 36. There was also the existence of mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. All of this had
little change from the echocardiogram taken on May , 1997 ,
which revealed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% along with
hypokinesis and a small pericardial effusion. This was markedly
different from the patient&apos;s echocardiogram in January 1997 with
revealed an ejection fraction of 67% with normal left ventricular
function and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was started
on a Lasix regimen in order to start diuresis with good response to
intravenous Lasix. The patient also was less dependent on oxygen
supplements , however , the patient still reported episodes of
dyspnea upon minor activity. A cardiology consultation was
obtained to evaluate the deterioration in the patient&apos;s cardiac
function. This deterioration was associated with the toxicity of
Adriamycin. A repeat echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate the
pericardial effusion as well as an abnormality identified on the
May , 1997 , echocardiogram consistent with a possible rupture
of one of the chordae tendineae. There was little difference
between the echocardiogram from May , 1997 , June , 1997 ,
and February , 1997. The patient was maintained on a regimen of
Lasix as well as Ace inhibitors. Initially , the addition of
ionatrope was considered. However , given the patient&apos;s history of
potassium and magnesium wasting , it was decided to add digoxin to
the patient&apos;s medical regimen.
The patient was also evaluated for the possibility of developing a
pulmonary embolus. Lower extremity noninvasive examinations
revealed patent vasculature , but no indication of a lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis. The patient also received a VQ scan which
revealed a low probability of the presence of a pulmonary embolus.
After the obtaining of a VQ scan which was negative , the heparin
that was initially stated upon admission of the patient , was
stopped.
The patient was discharged on a regimen of enalapril as well as
Lasix in order to manage the congestive heart failure. The
etiology of the congestive heart failure was thought to the
Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has a history of
a potassium and magnesium wasting. Serial profile-7s were obtained
and potassium and magnesium were regularly supplemented. The
patient was discharged with a daily regimen of potassium.
DISPOSITION: The patient showed marked clinical improvement with
diuresis as well as actively reduction with an Ace inhibitor. The
patient was warned that she needed to watch her salt intake. Of
note , the patient was noted not to be compliant with a low-salt
diet. Three days before admission , the patient admitted to having
a Chinese food dinner which may have contributed to the patient&apos;s
element of congestive heart failure.
The patient was discharged with the following medications: Colace
100 mg b.i.d.; Vasotec 10 mg q.d.; Lasix 20 mg q.d.; KCl 10 mEq
q.d.; and magnesium gluconate 500 mg q.d.
The patient was discharged in stable condition , with followup with
Dr. Gransberry of Lourdesko Memorial Hospital Oncology.

ATTENDING: JOSEF CROTTEAU M.D.
The patient was admitted Watylake Hospital Cardiology
Service and Coronary Care Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Myocardial infarction.
2. Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Depression.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ).
8. History of GI bleed.
9. Obstructive sleep apnea.
10. Status post cholecystectomy.
11. Status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve
replacement.
12. History of transfusion reaction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male
with coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass
graft in 1982 , also status post Bjork-Shiley aortic valve
replacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo CABG in
1995 with SVG to OM2 and SVG to LAD , who presented to Nalcon Memorial Hospital after developing chest pain unrefractory to
nitroglycerin. En route to the ER , he suffered a ventricular
fibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 Joules to a
rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. He then received fluids
and lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressure
and was intubated in the field.
Of note , the patient had an AVR Bjork-Shiley and saphenous vein
graft to LAD and left circumflex sequential grafting , original
surgery in 1982. In 1985 , he underwent reoperation with
saphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. He
has had multiple admissions to Estatewentlung Lufirm Community Medical Center in the past
year. In September 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. He ruled in
for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to the
catheterization lab. At the cath lab in September 2003 , at Dotonh/ Medical Center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.
He had saphenous vein graft to LAD , it was patent , saphenous vein
graft to OM2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally in
OM2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. It
was determined at this point that PCI would be inappropriate. At
that time and echo showed an EF of 25% with moderate mitral
regurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. He
was medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor ,
beta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. Per his wife , he had been
doing well since April of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens on
occasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch with
his son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , but
this time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. He
called EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following code
status mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest.
On arrival to Tonwa Medical Center he had a heart rate of 132 , blood
pressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. He was given normal
saline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and he
was paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patient
would likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspected
myocardial infarction. He was transferred the Specce Health Care Cardiac Cath lab emergently.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post CABG as noted above; history
of multiple non-Q-wave MIs in 1985 and subsequently history of
diabetes type 2 , peripheral vascular disease , depression , chronic
renal insufficiency , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , history of GI
bleed , peptic ulcer disease , obstructive sleep apnea , atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , status post
cholecystectomy , status post aortobifem bypass graft in 1987 ,
history of transfusion reaction resulting in hemolysis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known medical allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included insulin , Isordil , digoxin ,
aspirin , folate , Lasix , Lipitor , lisinopril , metoprolol ,
Protonix , and Coumadin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a current smoker. He is a retired truck
driver and he is married.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On presentation to Thara Healthcare , he had a pulse of 70 , blood pressure 87/54. He was
intubated and had a saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. He was
intubated and sedated. His JVP was 12 cm of water. He had a
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs ,
or gallops. He had a mechanical S2. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bilateral lower extremities were
cool and clammy with 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally. He had
ecchymosis as a result of his Coumadin use.
Initial labs were significant for a glucose of 220 , a CK of 565
with an MB of 74 and troponin of 14.0. Hematocrit was 48. His
INR was 1.7. Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.
EKG with sinus rhythm and a left bundle-branch block with right
axis deviation. Also with inferior T-wave inversions and 1-mm ST
elevation in V3 and 1-mm ST depressions in I and O.
Echocardiogram previously on 3/3 revealed an EF of 39% with
inferior HK and AK , lateral HK , inferoapical DK. He had mild MR
and aortic radiant of 27/16. The right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
In summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chronic
coronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in the
setting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated ST
elevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Lungken Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferred
emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where
catheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graft
disease. His left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%
lesion. The mid LAD was proximally occluded after the first
septa. His left circumference is proximally occluded. The
distal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease and
the distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseased
with focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. Saphenous
vein graft to LAD is patent , saphenous vein graft to OM has 99%
lesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting disk
aortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. In
summary , the patient had what was considered to be a
nonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted
for medical management. He received optimal medical management
for his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix ,
statin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. His ischemic
EKG changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of the
Coronary Care Unit and he has been chest pain-free for the
remainder of that day. His CK peaked at 1090 on 6/17/03 . Pump:
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal PTT of
6084 for his Bjork-Shiley valve. His Coumadin was held in the
setting. He had a TTE on 6/17/03 , which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior HK ,
left atrial enlargement , mild to moderate MR , and well-seated
AVR. The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out to
the floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. Rhythm: As
noted above , the patient admitted with status post VF arrest. He
was successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.
However , his course was complicated by an episode of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160s
associated with hypotension for which he was electively
cardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which he
was loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normal
sinus rhythm since that episode. However , after the patient had
been transferred to the floor and was stable , he received a
single lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,
coronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest.
Pulmonary: The patient was initially intubated in the CCU for
airway protection. He was rapidly weaned on the sedation. He
was successfully extubated on 1/28/03 . However , his chest x-ray
was complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which was
concerning for pneumonia. He ultimately has sputum culture that
grew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day course
for pseudomonal pneumonia. Please see ID section below for more
details.
Infectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question of
sepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . He was started on empiric
levofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia by
chest x-ray. He was also given one dose of gentamicin and then
covered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and Flagyl while
awaiting results. He ultimately had no growth from any blood
cultures , although did have on sputum culture positive for
pseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant to
levofloxacin. He was ultimately switched over to single agent
ceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonal
pneumonia/bronchitis.
Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. In the Intensive Care Unit ,
he had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. At the time
of discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,
although it seems to be normalizing. It is likely that this is
contributed by his Dilaudid received at the time of
catheterization.
Heme: The patient anticoagulated at home with Coumadin and then
during his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for his
Bjork-Shiley valve with a goal PTT of 60 to 80. At the time of
discharge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.5 to
3.5. Previously , his home dose of Coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.
q.d. He will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 units
therapeutically with PTT 60 to 80 until his INR is therapeutic on
Coumadin. Hematology continued the patient also with a
macrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. At the time of
discharge , his labs were pending for a B12 level , methylmalonic
acid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while the
patient is at rehab.
Endocrine: The patient with diabetes. He was continued on NPH
with a Regular Insulin sliding scale with good control of his
sugars. At the time of discharge , he should remain on his NPH
with sliding scale coverage.
FEN: The patient was placed on ADA diet and his electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n.
Prophylaxis: The patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. He was
also placed on a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic GERD.
Tubes , lines , and drains: The patient had an NG tube for a short
time during his Intensive Care Unit stay while was intubated for
enteral feeding. This was subsequently removed and the patient
has been able to take adequate p.o. intake. However , he has a
dual lumen peripherally inserted central catheter placed in his
right antecubital fossa on 3/9/03 for intravenous access for IV
heparin as well as to continue his 14-day course of ceftazidime.
Pertinent labs at the time of discharge include a BUN of 53 ,
creatinine of 2.2 , white blood cell count of 11.4 with 73% polys ,
20% lymphocytes , 6% monos , 2% eosinophils , and 1% basophils.
Hematocrit of 33.3 , which is stable , platelets of 175. His MCV
was 96.8 and his RDW was 18.0. His last PTT was 66.1 and INR was
1.3.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. The patient is continued on his amiodarone load 400 mg p.o.
t.i.d. x 3 days , last day of this dosing scheduled 4/3/03 ; and
the patient is to be switched to 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days ,
last day of this dose to be 4/30/03 ; and the patient to be
switched to amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. , starting on 2/26/03 and
is to remain on this dose indefinitely.
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Ceftazidime 2 g IV q.12h. x 14 days , last dose on 10/6/03 .
4. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

6. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. This is the patient&apos;s new baseline
diuretic regimen.
7. Heparin GTT infusion , current rate 900 units per hour ,
continuous. This should be adjusted to achieve a goal PTT of 60
to 80.
8. NPH insulin 15 units subcu q.a.m. , 10 units subcu q.p.m. The
patient also has Regular Insulin sliding scale subcu q.a.c. and

blood sugar of 201-250 , give 4 units subcu. If 251-300 , give 6
units. If 301-350 , give 8 units subcu. If 351-400 give 10 units
subcu and call health officer.
9. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.6h. hold for systolic blood pressure
less than 85 , pulse less than 50. This may be converted over to
once a day form of metoprolol at the discretion of the accepting
physician. However , would not convert to atenolol given the
renal insufficiency.
10. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one tablet sublingual q.5 minutes x 3
for chest pain.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Syncope.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2.
Bradycardia. 3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Hypertension. 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 74-year-old male with
history of acute inferior myocardial infarction in February of
1998 , with total occlusion of the mid circumflex , with fresh
thrombus which was percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied
and stented. At catheterization in February , he was noted to have
50 percent right coronary artery , as well. His hospital course at
that time was complicated by atrial fibrillation with Mobitz type I
block. The patient was loaded on procainamide. He also had
several episodes of congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram in
February showed right ventricular dysfunction. At discharge , a
submaximum exercise tolerance test , the patient went three minutes
and twenty-one seconds without evidence of ischemia. On the day of
admission , the patient was in cardiac rehabilitation class when he
became light-headed while seated and lost consciousness for
approximately five seconds. He regained full consciousness. He
denied chest pain , shortness of breath , chest tightness , fever ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. He had no urine or stool incontinence ,
and no focal abnormal motor movements were noted by observers. A
code blue was called , and he went to the Emergency Department.
Electrocardiogram showed old inferior Qs , PRWP , and slightly
elevated T wave in V2 with left anterior fascicular block with
heart rate of 49. Initial CK was 39 with a Troponin I of 0.02. He
was admitted to Wa T S for further workup and treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2. Diabetes
mellitus on insulin. 3. Hypertension. 4. Status post bilateral
knee replacements. 5. Asbestos exposure. 6. Chronic renal
insufficiency.

no apparent distress. Vital signs , afebrile , heart rate 50 , blood
pressure 111/87 , respirations 16 , 98 percent on two liters. HEENT ,
atraumatic , normocephalic , oropharynx clear. Neck , carotids 2+ , no
bruits , no cervical adenopathy with the exception of a 2.0
centimeter node in the occipital region. Chest , clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular , bradycardic , regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2. Abdomen , positive bowel sounds ,
soft , non-tender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities , no edema , no other lymphadenopathy. Neurological
examination , alert and oriented x three , non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory is significant for a
creatinine of 1.6 and a potassium of 5.1. Blood count were white
blood cell count 5.5 , hematocrit 44.6 , platelets 233. CK 39 ,
cardiac Troponin I 0.02.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 74-year-old male with history of
acute inferior myocardial infarction in February , complicated by
postmyocardial infarction atrial fibrillation and Mobitz type I
block , now admitted following syncopal episode. The
Electrophysiology Service was consulted and prior to
electrophysiology study the patient underwent evaluation for
possible ischemic causes of an arrhythmia. He was initially ruled
out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and
electrocardiograms. On standard Bruce protocol exercise tolerance
test mibi , April , 1999 , the patient went four minutes and
thirty seconds , maximum heart rate 121 , maximum blood pressure
210/85. He had typical chest pain for angina and chest tightness
at peak exercise which was relieved with rest. There were no
electrocardiogram changes. He remained in sinus rhythm. Mibi
images showed a mixed MI in basilar half of the inferior wall in
4/20 segments , mild peri-infarct ischemia in 3/20 segments in the
right coronary artery territory. He had normal left ventricular
function , normal left ventricular volume , and global systolic left
ventricular function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 55
percent , wall motion abnormalities and severe inferior wall
hypokinesis and mild septal hypokinesis. Based on the results of
the exercise tolerance test mibi , the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on April , 1999 which revealed a normal left
main , left anterior descending artery with minor irregularities ,
left circumflex with 90 percent in-stent restenosis in proximal
segment with a dominant left circumflex , and right coronary artery
with a mid 50 percent lesion. The patient underwent successful
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the in-stent
restenosis. He was subsequently continued on aspirin. The
Electrophysiology Service recommended that the patient&apos;s
procainamide be stopped. Of note , the patient&apos;s QT interval was
not prolonged while on procainamide. After the procainamide was
held , the patient underwent electrophysiology study on October ,
1999 revealing normal sinus node recovery time , impaired AV nodal
conduction , no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia , and no
inducible supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. The
patient was discharged to home with plans to follow-up with his
primary cardiologist , perhaps with a Holter or event monitor.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d. 2.
Captopril 75 mg t.i.d. 3. NPH Humulin insulin 18 units q.a.m. and
8 units q.p.m. 4. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. 5. Vitamin
E. 6. Simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will be followed up by his primary care
doctor , in particular the posterior cervical single lymph node
should be followed up by his primary care physician.

SERVICE: Cardiology.
ADMISSION INFORMATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease , status post remote IMI
( catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes ,
hypercholesteremia , hypertension , admitted on 5/1/2005 for
chest pain. The patient experienced substernal chest pain
radiating to her left arm and shoulder while moving sofa. She
had associated diaphoresis and nausea but no shortness of breath.
She took 1 sublingual nitroglycerin and 2 aspirin. She was
subsequently transferred to the emergency department. There , her
vital signs were stable. She was found to have new right
bundle-branch block and ST elevations in leads I , aVL , and V2
through V6 as well as ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF.
She was treated with 5 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets , aspirin ,
heparin , Lopressor , and morphine. She was subsequently taken to
the cardiac catheterization lab , then transferred to the CCU for
further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On
5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the left
circumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosis
of the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. Her
LAD was stented. She was treated with Integrilin , aspirin ,
Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , and Lipitor. Her peak cardiac
markers were on 8/29/2005 and were as follows: CK 3344 , MB
386.4 , troponin I 191.4. Her EKG changes were slow to resolve.
Her admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree A-V
block , and new right bundle-branch block. On 8/29/2005 , the
patient developed transient complete heart block. Gel pads were
placed , but the patient regained her native rhythm. A temporary
wire was placed. On 4/21/2005 , the temporary wire failed to
capture and was adjusted. On 1/23/2005 , the patient was taken
back to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea of
precluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block.
A stent was placed in the first marginal. On 10/4/2005 , early
in the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-rest
precautions ). Her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. This
wire was then pulled. The patient developed chest pain without
EKG changes. She subsequently developed hypotension. There was
clinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds and
cool extremities. The patient was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization lab. A stat echo performed in the
cardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusion
with diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.
A pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 mL of bloody fluid.
It was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the right
ventricle and that the whole failed on its own. In the cardiac
catheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. A temporary
wire was replaced. On 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogram
showed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. The
patient&apos;s ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. There
was evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , and
basal and mid inferior walls. On 10/22/2005 , the patient&apos;s
second temporary wire was pulled. The patient remained in her
native rhythm. She had rare runs of asymptomatic NSVT ranging
from 5 to 11 beats. She was without chest pain or shortness of
breath for the duration of her hospital stay. It was thought
that the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or AICD
placement at the present time. The patient was discharged on
aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , lisinopril , and Lipitor. She had not
been on a statin previously. Her LFTs will require monitoring.
Notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , an
HDL of 38 , an LDL of 98 , and triglycerides of 149.
2. PULMONARY: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula
during her hospitalization. Status post pericardiocentesis , she
was weaned off oxygen. On the day of discharge , she was able to
ambulate on room air without desaturating.
3. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes mellitus. The patient was on oral
antihyperglycemics at home. In-house , she was treated standing
Lantus as well as Novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. She
was discharged on metformin. She has a normal creatinine
clearance.
4. HEME: Hematocrit. The patient&apos;s hematocrit dropped down
from the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. This
drop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematoma
status post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequently
stabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). There was a
desire to keep the patient&apos;s hematocrit above 30 given her acute
coronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion.
In the days prior to discharge , the patient&apos;s hematocrit
stabilized. If her hematocrit remains low , she might benefit
from outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , B12 ,
folate , reticulocyte count , and smear.
5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Urinary tract infection. The patient
developed a urinary tract infection. Urine culture on 8/29/2005
showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. She was treated initially
with levofloxacin , then Bactrim. A urine culture from 8/3/2005
showed no growth.
6. POSTPROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was treated
transiently with Ancef status post temporary wire placement.
Blood cultures on admission were negative. Blood cultures were
not rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile without
signs of bacteremia.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every
5 minutes x3 doses , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg p.o.
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily ,
metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to take her
medications as directed , particularly the Plavix. The patient
was instructed to follow up with Dr. Vanbelle in clinic on
6/24/2005 and with Dr. Bradly Moerke at the Medwinds Hospital .  She was instructed to call her doctor and present
to the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any other
symptoms concerning to her.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with home
services.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 47 year old white
male with a history of
insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , and coronary artery
disease. The patient presents with multiple syncopal episodes in
the week prior to admission. Cardiac risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension and a positive family history. He does not
smoke and has normal cholesterol. He has chronic stable angina for
which he needs one to three nitroglycerin per day over several
months. He has been gaining weight and has increasing peripheral
edema. He also notes decreased exercise tolerance and increasing
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He complains of PND but denies
orthopnea. In 2/10 he had a standard Bruce exercise test in which
he went 8 minutes and 15 seconds , stopping for typical chest pain
with a heart rate of 150 and blood pressure of 186/90. He had no
EKG changes and no arrhythmias. Thallium scanning showed anterior
and apical perfusion defects with delayed reperfusion.
Echocardiography at that time showed mild concentric hypertrophy
and akinesis of the anterior , lateral and apical walls. He had
only mildly decreased left ventricular function and no valvular
disease. The patient has been admitted to the Shire Health Center where he has undergone coronary angiography ,
which showed that his coronary arteries had no significant
obstruction. Over the week prior to admission he had four episodes

he had no arrhythmias. He occasionally had sinus
tachycardia. An exercise test showed that he went six minutes and
17 seconds of a standard Bruce protocol. His maximum heart rate
was 140 and blood pressure was 210/60. There were no EKG changes
with the exception of unifocal PVCs , so that there was no evidence
for ischemia. He had an echocardiogram which showed normal valves
and normal left ventricular function. Notably the right side of
his heart was also normal. The patient also underwent sleep study
during the day after sleep deprivation the previous night. The
study lasted only 1-1/2 hours and the patient was not noted during

Discharge Date: 5/13/1992
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old black female
with a history of hypertension ,
angina , adult onset diabetes , admitted after a syncopal event. She
has a known history of syncope which dates as far back as the late
1960s. In 1970 she had an episode of loss of consciousness with 30
seconds of generalized tonic convulsions witnessed by her daughter.
An EEG at that time showed diffuse theta waves but was nonfocal.
The patient was treated with Dilantin for less than a year. In
1972 she had another episode of syncope associated with
hyperventilation. In 1983 she had yet another episode of syncope
and a 24 hour Holter started after the event showed a heart rate
that went as low as 38 but was not associated with any symptoms. In
1987 she had a vasovagal event which was later aggravated when her
neighbor gave her a nitroglycerin tablet. Throughout this time she
has had multiple other episodes of syncope. Her last episode was
in 1989 , when she was admitted to the Cardiology Team for workup.
Her EKG was unremarkable , 24 hour Holter was normal , an
echocardiogram was normal , and she underwent an exercise stress
test which did not show ischemic changes. In October of 1992 , she
had carotid ultrasounds for symptoms of right hand and leg
numbness. They did not show significant stenosis. In October of
1992 , she was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and was started on Isordil and Lopressor empirically but these were
later discontinued. In February of 1992 she had a clinic visit with
Dr. Ed Ville who is her CALL MEDICAL CENTER doctor. The patient indicates
that she has stable exertional angina without limitation of daily
activity , chest pain is relieved with nitroglycerin and her most
recent episode was last week. She has also been on a stable dose
of Micronase for the last couple of years. On the morning of
admission , the patient awoke and felt fine , and was getting ready
to have coffee with her friends upstairs. She was reaching for
something across the table and suddenly felt a sharp pain in her
back and fell unconscious into the chair. Estimated loss of
consciousness was 6-7 minutes. She awoke confused , did not know
her name and had a little bit of difficulty seeing. It was unclear
by her history whether her vision was blurry or whether she felt
that there was a shade across her eyes. She denies any double
vision. Prior to this event she did not experience any prodrome or
aura. She also denied chest pain , shortness of breath or
palpitations. There was no loss of bladder or bowel function
during the event. The patient was given orange juice after the
episode and gradually she regained awareness of her surroundings.
Her vital signs were stable. She was brought to Tia Medical Center
for evaluation. There was a question of upper extremity twitching
by report from observers. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension
dating at least 10 years back and is presently not requiring any
treatment. She has a history , as mentioned , of recurrent syncopal
events. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with adult onset
diabetes and has been on a stable dose of Micronase. The patient
also has a history of multiple colonic polyps and in 1983 underwent
a left hemicolectomy for multiple polyps. In 1988 she underwent an
ileal resection for large inflammatory polyps leading to a small
bowel obstruction. She has had a cholecystectomy and an
appendectomy in the distant past. The patient also a history of
glaucoma. In 1973 and 1976 she had a right lower extremity DVT ,
etiology was unclear. The patient does not smoke , drink or use any
drugs. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include aspirin one tablet q d ,
Questran one pack q d , Micronase 5 mg po q d , Betaxolol eye drops
bid to each eye , Pilocarpine eye drops tid to each eye ,
eye drops bid to each eye. The patient receives monthly Vitamin
B12 injections. She also takes nitroglycerin with chest pain.
FAMILY HISTORY is significant for a brother who suffered a stroke
at the age of 74. There is also a family history of heart attacks.
No family history of gastrointestinal cancer. SOCIAL HISTORY: The
patient is separated and lives by herself in Hutmill Rd. , Bock Tonlake Son , North Dakota 32472 She has
eight children with many grandchildren. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS is
notable for episodes of sweats and nervousness over the last week
which she describes as being similar to the hot flashes of
menopause which she had at age 49. These episodes are occurring a
few times a day but do not in any way coincide with her syncopal
events. She is also complaining of right hand and foot numbness
which have increased in frequency. The numbness occasionally wakes
her up at night. She denies any motor weakness whatsoever.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an elderly , mildly obese female , in
no apparent distress. She was afebrile , with
a blood pressure of 126/70 , a heart rate of 60 , and a respiratory
rate of 18. HEENT exam was notable for pinpoint constriction of
her pupils secondary to her glaucoma eyedrops. Her pupils were
reactive. Her throat was benign. She had dentures. Her neck was
supple , without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Chest exam
revealed bibasilar , coarse crackles. On cardiac exam she had no
jugular venous distention , and carotids were normal without bruits.
She had a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , and an occasional
S4. There were no murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. The patient
was guaiac negative. Extremities were without edema and there was
no calf tenderness. The neurologic exam was entirely nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Includes a sodium of 143 , potassium of 4.3 ,
chloride of 109 , bicarbonate of 20 , BUN of 21;
creatinine was 1.0. The glucose was 160. Her calcium and
phosphate were normal. Her hematocrit was 43.4 , her white count
6.45 with a normal differential. Her coagulation factors were
normal. Her liver function tests were normal. A chest X ray
showed a calcific aorta but was otherwise clear. C spine X ray and
head CT on admission were also negative. The EKG showed no changes
from her baseline.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor , and
her Micronase was held. In fact , her fingerstick
glucose went as low as 80 that evening. On day two of admission ,
the patient had syncopal event while in house. She was apparently
walking about after having washed her face and was reaching to pull
the curtain when she began feeling lightheaded. She told the nurse
immediately , who tried to get her on the bed , and the patient
collapsed on the bed , was limp and lost consciousness for about 3-5
minutes. She had a systolic blood pressure of 200/105 and a heart
rate of 90. There were no changes on the cardiac monitor , and the
patient was noted to maintain a strong pulse at all times. She was
given Nitro Paste and 1 amp of D50. Fingerstick glucose was then
noted to be 232. The patient was witnessed to have mild twitching
of her jaw and eyelids and after five minutes , she opened her eyes
but was not able to respond. When asked to give her name , she was
not able to answer. The confusion subsided over the next couple of
minutes , and the patient was able to respond and was alert and
oriented. However , she had no recollection of the event. Further
workup included a head MRI , MR angiogram of her vertebrobasilar
circulation , a sleep deprived EEG , a cardiac echo , and a 24 hour
Holter. All of the above were negative. We also applied carotid
sinus stimulation and she showed no change in heart rate to either
side. The etiology of her syncopal event is not completely clear.
It appears that the patient does have a history of a witnessed
seizure but also has had syncopal events consistent with either
bradycardia or a vasovagal event.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with plans for a
repeat 24 hour Holter as an outpatient. FOLLOW UP:
She will follow up with Dr. Danilo Mcquaid in the THERPLEA HOSPITAL Clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS include

Discharge Date: 1/18/2003
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 72-year-old man with a history of
significant coronary artery disease , status post
CABG x 2 , stents and brachytherapy who was admitted for an NSVT
leading to fatigue and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient&apos;s symptoms first developed
last September , 2002 when he noticed
fatigue and shortness of breath. He had recently developed
bacteremia after a colonoscopy and never felt that he had quite
recovered. He was being treated with atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. at
the time for his coronary artery disease. His wife and son , who
are a nurse and a PA , respectively , felt his pulse and it was
frequently in the 30s , but was also occasionally normal. He
decreased his atenolol to 25 mg once a day but his symptoms
persisted. He was seen as an outpatient and found to have frequent
PVCs on EKG.
Over the past few months the patient has also noticed increased
angina , both with and without activity. He has had increased
difficulty walking up the stairs causing chest pain and shortness
of breath that are relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. Then two
days prior to admission the patient also noticed pain at rest but
was again relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. On the morning of
admission he felt chest heaviness that woke him up from sleep. He
did not take any nitroglycerin but his wife told him that he was
&quot;gasping for breath&quot;. Over the past month he had been seeing his
cardiologist , Dr. Verdun . Because of his shortness of breath he
was started on Lasix for 3-4 days but this also did not relieve his
symptoms. He had Holter monitoring with exercise , going up and
down the stairs , at clinic and this also showed frequent PVCs. He
had an electrocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 30%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. He had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1974 and 1982. He had
PCI of his left main coronary artery 6/18 and PTCA and
brachytherapy secondary to in-stent restenosis in April , 2002.
Intervention 6/18 his left main was radiated. His bypass
vessels are LIMA/LAD , SVG/marginal 1 , LIMA/LAD , SVG/RPDA.
2. He had a significant GI bleed secondary to aspirin and
Plavix in 2002. His hematocrit went to 17. The patient has
remained on aspirin and Plavix secondary to his coronary
artery disease.
3. History of prostate cancer treated with radiation , complicated
by radiation prostatitis.
4. Diabetes.
5. Status post right carotid endarterectomy. No history of TIAs
or strokes.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg; Plavix 75 mg; atenolol 25
mg once a day; Isordil 60 mg twice a
day; lisinopril 20 mg once a day; Norvasc 5 mg once a day; Lipitor
10 mg once a day; gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day; hydroxyzine 25 mg
twice a day; Glyburide 10 mg twice a day; metformin 1 , 000 mg twice
a day; Nexium 40 mg once a day; iron sulfate 300 mg once a day;
calcium 1250 twice a day; multivitamin once a day; vitamin E; folic
acid; Colace.
FAMILY HISTORY: He has several siblings with coronary artery
disease in their 60s.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former engineer for Ssand Lare , but
stopped working when he was in his 40s because of
his coronary artery disease. He denies any tobacco , alcohol , or
drug use. He lives with his wife.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Two-pillow orthopnea that is stable , no
palpitations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 95.1 , heart rate
58 , blood pressure 112/50 , breathing 22 ,
satting 98% on room air. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact.
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation. JVP
was 10.0 cm with a right carotid endarterectomy scar.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , positive
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No lower extremity edema. NEURO:
Cranial nerves II-XII intact.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 ,
chloride 104 , bicarb 23 , BUN 35 , creatinine 1.5
his baseline is 1.4 , glucose 148 , white count 9.0 , hematocrit 37 ,
platelets 297. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CK
125 , MB 1.6 , troponin 0.02.
Electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and 2-3 beats of
normal sinus rhythm interspersed with NSVT.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: Ischemia: It was unclear
whether the patient&apos;s worsening chest pain was
from progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this was
demand ischemia from his frequent NSVT. He was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of his
arrhythmia , he was taken for catheterization. His catheterization
showed an LAD 100% lesion , diag 1 80% lesion , left circumflex 100%
lesion , the ramus was widely patent , RCA showed a 100% lesion ,
right PDA 100% lesion. Overall , his LIMA graft to the LAD was
widely patent , his SVG graft to marginal 1 and SVG graft to RCA
were both occluded but had collaterals. What was new from his
previous catheterization was disease in his PDA. It was determined
to further treat the patient&apos;s coronary artery disease with medical
management. After his heart rate was controlled with amiodarone
and with a pacemaker , he did however continue to have some fatigue
and shortness of breath. As a result he had an adenosine MIBI to
evaluate for functional ischemia given the findings on his
catheterization. The MIBI showed a moderate sized perfusion defect
throughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateral
walls showing a moderate amount of reversibility. His ejection
fraction was estimated at 50% with akinesis of the inferior and
inferoseptal walls with reduced thickening. He did not have any
EKG changes during the procedure. His beta blockade was increased
to Lopressor 50 b.i.d. and he continued on his nitrates. He was
actually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain or
shortness of breath. It is possible that the symptoms that he had
later on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overload
which responded well to diuresis. He will follow up with Dr.
Rafi . It is unlikely that any intervention will be able to be
done but he will explore this as an outpatient.
2 ) Pump: The patient did experience some shortness of breath
several days into his admission. He had been approximately four
liters positive over several days. He was given 20 mg of IV Lasix
and responded well. He was sent home with 20 mg of Lasix q. Monday
and Thursday.
3 ) Rhythm: The patient&apos;s electrocardiogram and telemetry strips
were concerning because while he was technically in normal sinus
rhythm , he was usually only in normal sinus rhythm for 3-4 beats at
a time at most , and in between that , had several runs of NSVT. The
NSVT never progressed to sustained V-TAC and the patient was always
hemodynamically stable. However , there was concern that this could
ultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He
was loaded on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. which he tolerated
well. He also required an additional 150 mg IV x 1 load to
stabilize his rhythm. He had an ICD and DDI pacemaker placed on
7/26 without complication. After the pacemaker was placed he was
still experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may have
been overpaced. As a result his settings were adjusted to increase
his AV delayed 240 and he was changed to DDD mode. He also had a
number of beats shortened that would be required to detect the VT ,
to 24. By the time of discharge his amiodarone was decreased to
400 mg q.d. This may ultimately be decreased even further to 200
but will be decided by Dr. Swymer .
4 ) Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes. We held
his metformin on admission because of his catheterization but
restarted it upon discharge. Any elevated blood sugars were
covered with an insulin sliding scale.
5 ) Pulmonary: As mentioned above the patient did have some
shortness of breath which was likely due to volume overload. He
responded well to 20 mg IV Lasix. He always maintained his oxygen
saturations. He will have pulmonary function tests as an
outpatient to establish a baseline given his new treatment with
amiodarone.
6 ) Heme: The patient does have a history of a GI bleed on aspirin
and Plavix. We monitored his hematocrit closely. He came in at
37. It did decrease to 31. During his hospitalization he had an
episode of bright red blood per rectum. Given his history of
radiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that he
had this. He always remained hemodynamically stable and did not
require any transfusions. At baseline his hematocrit is probably
closer to 33 and it is likely that the 37 was an elevation from
decreased p.o. intake. Follow up stools were guaiac-negative.
FOLLOWUP: He will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. Halvorson and
Fabus on 4/4/03 . He will also have pulmonary
function tests on 5/8 .

precordial pain , which progressed to substernal chest pressure
radiating to the neck down her right arm and left arm and a
feeling of left arm numbness. The patient did experience
significant nausea and vomiting and took multiple nitroglycerins
without relief. She presented to Daley Oer&apos;s Memorial Hospital Emergency
Room , was noted to have ST depressions in the inferolateral leads
as well as T-wave inversions in her lateral leads. Troponin at
that time was 14. The patient was admitted for non-ST elevation

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired beautician. She has a
45-year history of prior smoking and currently continues to smoke
occasionally. At a high , she smoked three packs per day. Denies
alcohol use. No recreational drug use. The patient currently
lives alone.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother , who died at age 61 of
pyelonephritis and myocardial infarction. Father died at age 52
of brain tumor. She has two siblings with no heart disease.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative other than mentioned in
HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , temp 97 , pulse 78 ,
respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 144/52 , and pulse oxymetry
99% on room air. General , this is a pleasant elderly female in
no acute distress , slightly slurred speech. HEENT , normocephalic
and atraumatic. Extraocular motions are intact. Neck is supple.
No lymphadenopathy , no thyroid enlargement , bilateral carotid
bruits palpable. Cardiovascular , distant heart sounds , regular
rate and rhythm , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left
sternal base. No rubs or gallops. Crackles heavily at the chest
wall , no wheezes. Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended.
Bowel sounds are present. Extremities , no clubbing or cyanosis.
Pedal pulses , 1+ , left greater than right. Neuro , cranial nerves
II through XII intact. Strength 5/5 diffusely , light touch
intact throughout , no dysmetria , mild difficulty with alternating
movements , and negative pronator drift.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs upon admission included ??__?? creatinine
of 3.1 , otherwise the electrolytes within normal limits , sodium
129 , and glucose 132. LFTs were within normal limits. Hemogram
showed a mildly depressed hematocrit of 32 , troponin elevated at
14.4 , CK 364 , and CKMB 28.3. EKG upon admission showed normal
sinus rhythm at 83 , normal axis , ST depressions noted in leads II
V5 , and V6. No ST elevations. Q waves in III and F. T wave
inversions noted in I through III , F , V6 , poor R-wave
progression.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 61-year-old female with a history
of multiple vasculopathies , who presented with a non-ST elevation
MI. The patient was noted to have markedly elevated troponin and
progressive T-wave inversions laterally.
1. Cardiovascular ischemia , following admission , the patient was
initiated on aspirin , Plavix , nitroglycerin drip , oxygen p.r.n. ,
and the beta-blocker was titrated up as tolerated. ACE inhibitor
as well as hydralazine were held. Over the first night of
admission , the patient noted increasing chest discomfort. The
nitroglycerin was titrated up. EKG showed continued T wave
inversions laterally as well as marked increase in troponin up to
an elevation of 105. Cardiac fellow was contacted and the
patient was titrated up further on her nitroglycerin to a max of
200. The patient did not have chest pain on the night of
admission , however was noted to have EKG changes and elevated
troponin as mentioned. On the morning following admission , on
11/8/05 , the patient was noted to have new onset of chest
discomfort and at that time was noted to have ST elevations in
her inferior leads III and F as well as V6 and L. At that time ,
due to the continued chest discomfort and new ST elevation , the
patient was taken to the cath lab , at which time , she underwent a
cardiac catheterization and was noted to have a three-vessel
disease status post CABG. She was noted to have 90% of occlusion
of the SVG graft to RTPDA status post PDA. These lesions were
intervened upon with drug eluding stents x 3. Following the
catheterization , the patient was continued on her medical
management. She remained chest pain free and the nitroglycerin
drip was discontinued. Following the cath , the patient&apos;s
troponins trended down and she had mild ST elevations that
persisted inferiorly but were diminished prior to discharge.
Preventive measures including nutrition and smoking sensation
were obtained. The patient appears reluctant to quit smoking.
Cardiovascular pump , the patient has a history of hypertension ,
which was well controlled throughout her hospitalization.
Isordil and hydralazine were initially held on admission while on
the nitroglycerin drip. The ACE inhibitor was held secondary to
acute renal insufficiency. Therefore , the beta-blocker was
titrated up. Upon discharge , the patient may reinitiate on
low-dose hydralazine and Isordil as well as reinitiation of the
ACE as tolerated with renal function. In addition , the patient
has a history of diastolic dysfunction , which is likely due to
her history of hypertension. An echocardiogram from October 2005
during a prior admission for heat failure showed an EF of 60% , as
well as inferior apical hypokinesis , mild elevated LVEDP. The
patient appeared mildly hypervolemic during her hospitalization
but did not show any signs of acute congestive heart failure.
Initially diuresis was held secondary to acute renal
insufficiency. However , she received Lasix 40 mg IV x1 on
2/16/05 due to abdominal discomfort and distention due to mild
volume overload. Cardiovascular rhythm , the patient was
continued on telemetry throughout her hospitalization. She has
no history of arrhythmias and no events were noted on her
telemetry. She obtained EKGs , which showed no significant change
or nodal blockage.
2. Endocrine , the patient has a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes , which was moderately well controlled throughout her
hospitalization. She has a history of hemoglobin A1c of 7.3 as
of February 2005. Upon admission , glyburide was held and the
patient was continued on Lantus as well as a sliding scale of
Regular Insulin. She obtained fingers sticks a.c. and h.s.
Glipizide was initiated on 2/16/05 and will be titrated up as
tolerated as an outpatient.
3. Respiratory , this system was stable throughout admission.
The patient had crackles on exam , but no significant pulmonary
edema on chest x-ray. Abdominal CT on 7/16/05 was notable for
moderate right and trace left pleural effusions. The patient
maintained excellent pulse oximetry on room air without any
respiratory compromise.
4. Renal , upon admission , the patient was noted to have acute
renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 3.2. The patient has a
history of chronic renal insufficiency secondary to hypertensive
nephropathy , diabetic nephropathy , and likely renal artery
stenosis. Prior renal ultrasound showed an atrophic left kidney
with mild decrease in perfusion. Following admission , the
patient was initiated on D5W with 3 ampules of bicarb as well as
Mucomyst in preparation for likely cardiac catheterization. She
was continued on IV fluids following the catheterization.
Despite these preventive measures , the patient had a marked
increase in her creatinine following cardiac cath with a high
creatinine of 5 on 7/20/05 . Renal consult was obtained and
advised continued treatment. A urine sediment was obtained which
was consistent with ATN. An abdominal CT showed evidence again
of an atrophic left kidney. Creatinine was noted to begin to
decrease on 7/16/05 and was 4.2 the day before discharge. The
patient will follow up with Dr. Lamantia in Nephrology within three
months&apos; time.
5. GI , the patient was noted to have right upper quadrant
abdominal pain on 7/20/05 . She had had mild elevations in her
LFTs , most notably an alk phos of 293. However , these values
stabilized throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. An
abdominal CT was obtained without contrast that showed no sign of
obstruction , hepatobiliary disease , but was notable for a ventral
hernia that was not strangulated or incarcerated. The patient
continued to pass and had regular bowel movements. She was
continued on bowel regimen. The pain was thought to be likely
secondary to ventral hernia with increased volume status.
Therefore , she was given a mild diuresis to decrease volume
overload.
6. ID was stable.
7. Heme , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop prior
to cath. She dropped from 32 to 26. She was transfused two
units of packed red blood cells prior to catheterization in order
to keep the hematocrit greater than 30. There was no acute
source of blood loss noted. Guaiac stools were negative. There
is likely a component of anemia of chronic disease secondary to
chronic renal insufficiency. The patient&apos;s hematocrit continued
to trend down and on 7/16/05 , an abdominal CT was obtained to
rule out retroperitoneal bleed , which was negative. The patient
was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on 7/16/05 .
She will likely require a further anemia workup as an outpatient.
8. FEN , the patient was not given any electrolyte scales
secondary to her acute renal insufficiency. She was noted to
have hyponatremia with a lowest of 123 and was therefore placed
on free water 1.5-liter restriction with adequate resolution.
The patient was also placed on a less than 2-gm salt restriction
to decrease volume overload. She was noted to have an increased
phosphorous level and was started on PhosLo. She had elevated
potassiums , but this did not exceed 5. The patient was continued
on a cardiac/renal 1800 ADA diet. Prophylaxis included SCD and
Pneumoboots in the setting of anemia. She was continued on a
proton pump inhibitor.
CODE: The patient is DNR/DNI.
DISPOSITION: Upon discharge , the patient was in stable condition
and will be discharged home without service. She was able to
ambulate without chest pain or shortness of breath tolerating
p.o. intake well. She will have follow-up as noted in the
addendum. The patient was instructed not to smoke and to take
daily weights and if she gained more than 2 pounds per day or 5
pounds in a week , she was instructed to call her doctor. She
should seek medical attention for worsening shortness of breath ,
chest pain , weight gain , dizziness , worsening abdominal pain , or
any other concerns.
PLAN:
1. Follow up with Dr. Chesebro , monitor for continued decrease in
creatinine. Consider reinitiating the ACE inhibitor with
resolution of acute renal insufficiency. Titrate the
beta-blocker and restart nitrates as tolerated. Titrate up
glipizide as needed. Consider further anemia workup. Encourage
smoking sensation. Continue to monitor abdominal pain/LFTs and
consider further evaluation of ventral hernia. Check LFTs with
recent addition of Lipitor.
2. Follow up with Dr. Burkle post MI management.
3. Follow up with Dr. Bottrell for management of chronic renal
insufficiency.

Discharge Date: 3/4/2000
SERVICE: GENERAL MEDICINE Ence T Di Au O
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. TYPE II DIABETES.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
4. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.

10. GASTROPARESIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Egelhoff is a 66-year-old
woman who presented with one week of
increasing shortness of breath with exertion , increasing peripheral
edema , and increasing abdominal distention. She denies any chest
pain , palpitations , chest pressure , nausea , vomiting , or
diaphoresis. She thought that her abdominal distention was
secondary to chronic constipation and her last bowel movement was
four days prior to admission. She felt that her abdominal
distention was contributing to her shortness of breath because she
was unable to take deep breaths. In addition , she has a long
history of chronic anemia with no clear diagnosis. She denied any
melena or bright red blood per rectum. She also has a long history
of low back pain , so she does not lie flat to sleep. In addition ,
she complains of some early satiety. She denies fevers , chills ,
chest pain , palpitations , lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , weight
loss , or known weight gain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Poorly controlled diabetes with intolerance
to Humulin insulin ( she believes this made
her retinopathy worse ) , peripheral neuropathy , gastroparesis ,
coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , status post a
left femoral popliteal bypass surgery , chronic constipation , carpal
tunnel syndrome , history of Acinetobacter pneumonia in 1997 ,
chronic anemia , Charcot foot , status post open reduction internal
fixation of a left ankle fracture , status post cholecystectomy ,
history of C. difficile colitis , echocardiogram in 1997 revealing
left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 55% ,
Persantine thallium in October of 1994 revealing moderate anterior
ischemia in the left anterior descending territory.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: NPH pork insulin , 42 units q.a.m.;
Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.; Vaseretic
10/25 mg q. day; aspirin 325 mg q. day; Senokot; Niferex 150
b.i.d.; diazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Avandia 4 mg p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES: Aldomet , Procardia , Darvocet causes drowsiness ,
Percocet causes vomiting.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. Her son is involved in her
care. Occasionally she lives with him. She does
not smoke or drink. Her husband died of complications of a
coronary artery bypass graft about one year prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Uncomfortable secondary to
distended abdomen. Temperature
97.3 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 172/68 , respiratory rate 18 ,
96% on room air. Her HEENT exam revealed a clear oropharynx ,
nonicteric sclerae. Extraocular movements were full. Her neck was
supple with 2+ carotid upstrokes and a faint left carotid bruit.
Jugular venous pressure was difficult to assess secondary to body
habitus. She has bibasilar crackles in her lung fields. Her heart
was regular rate with a normal S1 and somewhat loud S2. She has no
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Her abdomen was soft , slightly
distended , and obese. She had no shifting dullness and no
hepatosplenomegaly. Her extremities were remarkable for 2+ pitting
edema , right greater than left. She had weak pulses bilaterally ,
weaker on the left than the right.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 95 , bicarb 30 , BUN 34 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 212 , ALT 15 , AST 14 , alkaline
phosphatase 76 , total bilirubin 0.4 , CK 53 , troponin I - 0.00 ,
albumin 4. White blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 28.3 , MCV 86 ,
RDW 13.3 , platelets 303. Urinalysis revealed 3+ leuk esterase with
trace blood , too numerous to count white blood cells , and 10-15 red
blood cells. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per
minute with normal intervals and axis. She had an isolated Q wave
in lead III. She also had T wave inversions in V5 and V6 which
were unchanged from prior comparison EKG in 1998.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Genna was initially admitted to the
short stay unit for blood transfusion , workup of
her chronic anemia , and diuresis for new onset congestive heart
failure. On hospital day #2 , she developed what appeared to be a
32 beat run of ventricular tachycardia. She was thus transferred
to the general medicine service for further management and workup.
Her hospital course by systems is as follows:
1. NEUROLOGIC. Mrs. Byfield continued to complain of low back
pain which has been a chronic problem and for
which she is followed by Dr. Petrocelli in spine clinic here at Go Tyredd Egebrat .  She reports that he has already made
arrangements for her to undergo an open MRI at the Taha Memorial Hospital , as we do not have these facilities here , and
will follow up with him in clinic after she has this test. In the
past she has had cortisone injections without benefits , and it was
felt that since she has no acute exacerbation of this chronic
problem and already had followup in place , further consultation was
not necessary during this hospitalization. She was reinitiated on
Neurontin 300 mg q.h.s. , then increased to b.i.d. , and to be
increased to t.i.d. as an outpatient. She reports that with this
regimen she finally was able to sleep at night and reports a
significant improvement in her neuropathic pain secondary to
diabetic neuropathy as well as sciatica.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR. Mrs. Sloas was aggressively diuresed for
fluid overload in the setting of new
congestive heart failure. She responded well to IV Lasix. She had
a cardiology consultation , and they determined that the ventricular
tachycardia noted on the monitor was actually an artifact and not
real. A long discussion between the patient , her son , and her
primary care doctor was undertaken. Mrs. Glicken expressed her
fervent desire not to undergo cardiac catheterization or coronary
artery bypass grafting because of her husband&apos;s traumatic
experience with these procedures. Given her reluctance to undergo
intervention , further diagnostic studies were deferred , such as
stress testing. Her medical management was further optimized. She
was continued on enteric coated aspirin. Her beta blocker dose was
increased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. of atenolol with heart rate control.
Her ACE inhibitor dose was also increased. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
q.h.s. was added for LDL cholesterol of 184. In addition , Isordil
was added to her cardiac regimen to decrease preload. She will be
discharged on 160 mg p.o. q. day of Lasix. She was told that her
dose may change , depending on her daily weights at home , and this
should be coordinated with the visiting nurse as well as her
primary care doctor.
3. GASTROINTESTINAL. Mrs. Jannetti continued to complain of
nonspecific abdominal pain as well as
constipation while in the hospital. She also had a significant
bout of nausea and vomiting. She was given an aggressive bowel
regimen including enemas , with good response. On 3/23 , because
of persistent abdominal pain and a somewhat more firm abdomen , a
KUB and upright was performed which was within normal limits. The
next day her pain , nausea , and vomiting had significantly resolved
with the addition of Reglan to her medical regimen for presumed
diabetic gastroparesis.
4. ENDOCRINE. A hemoglobin A1c was checked during this admission
and was 9.5. Because of persistently high morning
sugars , 8 units of NPH at night was begun in addition to her 45
units q.a.m. Her blood sugars remained under 200 with this
regimen.
5. HEMATOLOGIC. Mrs. Penington initially presented with a drop in
her hematocrit to 28. She was transfused two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in her
hematocrit. Iron studies as well as B12 and folate levels were
checked and were within normal limits. LDH , bilirubin , and
haptoglobin were also within normal limits. Her hematocrit
remained stable throughout the further course of her
hospitalization.
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Mrs. Loparco received a total of three
days of levofloxacin for a urinary tract
infection.
7. Finally , she was seen both by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and home referrals were put in place.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q. day; atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lasix 160 mg p.o. q. day; Lactulose
30 cc p.o. b.i.d. , and can increase to q.i.d. as needed; lisinopril
40 mg p.o. q. day; Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Niferex 150 , 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; Senna tablets , two tabs p.o. b.i.d.; simvastatin
40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. x2 days , and then
increase to 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.; NPH insulin ( pork ) 45 units subcu
q.a.m. , 8 units subcu q.p.m.; diazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
anxiety; nitroglycerin 1/150 , one tab sublingual q.5min. x3 p.r.n.
chest pain; Oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. back pain , not to
exceed four tablets per day; Motrin 600 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. back
pain , not to exceed four tablets per day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with home
services. She will have visiting nurse to check her
blood pressure , heart rate , and breathing status. In addition , she
was instructed to weigh herself each day at home and to record
those weights. She is to call her primary care doctor if her
weight increases by more than 2 pounds , and was told that she would
likely be instructed to increase her dose to b.i.d. She will have
a Chem-7 drawn by the visiting nurse this Monday. Finally , she
will have both home physical therapy and occupational therapy
services. She should follow up with her primary care doctor ,
Dr. Vbiles , in one to three weeks. She was also instructed to
keep her MRI appointment at the Tyme Tionan Medical Center Of , and
then to see Dr. Pompei in spine clinic after this test was
performed.

Discharge Date: 1/8/1996
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR/POSTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67 year old woman with a
history of atrial tachyarrhythmias but
no history of coronary artery disease. She came in with an
inferior/posterior myocardial infarction and was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit after initiation of TPA. Her cardiac risk
factors included tobacco , a question of hypercholesterolemia ,
negative for diabetes , hypertension , and family history. The
patient was a generally healthy female who smoked and had a history
of palpitations and atrial tachyarrhythmia as well as a junctional
rhythm and AIVR but no prior symptoms of coronary artery disease.
She had been followed by Dr. Ulven for complaints of dizziness
with palpitations and a work-up including a 24-hour Holter in 8/5
with frequent atrial premature beats , short bursts of
supraventricular tachycardia with occasional periods of junctional
tachyarrhythmia , and AIVR which correlated with the symptoms. An
echo in 8/5 showed a normal LVF with minimal mitral regurgitation
and systolic bowing. On exercise tolerance test at the time , she
went seven minutes stopping with symptoms of fatigue. Her maximal
heart rate was 76% and she had 1 mm ST elevations consistent with
but not diagnostic of ischemia. She was then managed on Procan
alone with good result for her arrhythmia. She was previously on
digoxin but no longer on it. She was active at baseline able to
walk two miles a day without chest pain , dyspnea on exertion ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ankle edema , claudication
symptoms , or other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease. The
morning of February , 1995 , she was in her usual state of health.
She awoke at 11 p.m. on 11/27/95 with 5/10 substernal chest pain ,
no shortness of breath , palpitations , diaphoresis , or light
headedness , and no prior similar events. She became nauseated and
diaphoretic without radiation to the arms or back and no pleuritic
or positional changes. They called the EMT and her blood pressure
was 116/62 , heart rate of 50 with her chest pain , she had NGT spray
times two en route , and in the Emergency Ward , she complained of
substernal chest pain with her vital signs unchanged. There was no
evidence of congestive heart failure. Her EKG showed 0.5 to 1 mm
ST elevations in II , III , aVF , and V6. There was no recent surgery
and no history of bleeds or cerebrovascular accident. TPA was
initiated within less than thirty minutes following arrival. She
was put on intravenous nitroglycerin , Heparin , morphine , and
aspirin. She had a resolution of her pain within 45 minutes
following the TPA with return to baseline of her ST segments. She
was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Atrial tachyarrhythmias ,
hypothyroidism , and status post
spinal fusion in 11/19 .
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission included Synthroid 0.125 mg and
Procan SR 500 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She had a twenty pack year history of smoking ,
currently smoking half a pack a day , and no
alcohol. She lived with her husband and her brother.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died at 94 from cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature was 97.5 , blood pressure 91/48 ,
heart rate of 48 , O2 saturation 99% on three
liters , and weight 115 pounds. She was alert , oriented , and
responsive. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugular
venous pressure was 5 cm. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: She had a
non-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm ,
and normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN:
Soft , non-tender , and non-distended. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in
the Emergency Ward. EXTREMITIES: Negative for cyanosis and edema
and 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. NEUROLOGICAL:
Non-contributory.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her sodium was 141 , potassium of 4.5 ,
creatinine of 0.7 , her LDH was 290 , her
first CPK was 53 , cholesterol was 222 , PA was less than assay , her
NAPA was 1.0 , chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart
failure or cardiomegaly , and her EKG in the Coronary Care Unit was
normal sinus with 0.15/0.08/0.2 , 0.5 mm ST elevations in F , and no
Q or flipped T waves.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit ,
put on aspirin q.d. , and kept on Heparin. We
held off on a beta blockade given her heart rate which was often
less than 50 with a systolic blood pressure of 80 to 90. Her
intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned off and she was given some
fluid boluses secondary to the low blood pressure. We started her
on simvastatin for her cholesterol and discussed smoking cessation.
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK was 789 with
an MB fraction of 79.2 and her troponin was 20. Over the course of
several days , her CPK drifted down to 695 to 604 with MB fraction
of 46.9%. Heparin was discontinued on 8/5/96 and the patient , on
2/23/96 , had been encouraged to get up and walk around. She did
so without any evidence of chest pain , she had no recurrence of
chest pain after this point , and on 8/5/96 , the Heparin was
discontinued and she continued to be pain free with ambulation. On
the morning of 2/27/96 , she had an exercise tolerance test , a
modified Bruce , which was positive. She went seven minutes and
twenty seconds stopping due to chest pain. There was no change in
her blood pressure , her maximal heart rate was 89 , and the EKG
showed 2 mm ST downsloping depressions in V4 and V5 that developed
with exercise and persisted into recovery which was highly
predictive of coronary artery disease. She came back up to the
floor and we discussed doing a catheterization with her. At the
time , we kept her NPO. An hour later , she developed 8/10 chest
pain that was relieved with one sublingual and she was pain free
before the EKG could be done , however , thirty minutes after that ,
she again developed 8/10 chest pain. An EKG showed 2-3 mm ST
elevations in V4 through V6 with pseudonormalization of T waves in
II , III , aVF , and V3 through V6. Her pain decreased to 6/10 , she
had been restarted on Heparin , and put on intravenous nitroglycerin
with her blood pressure tolerating it. She was given six
sublinguals and 8 mg of morphine without relief of pain , heart rate
was 60 , and blood pressure was 100/60. She was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory. The catheterization showed right
atrial pressure of 1 , right ventricle 24/4 , pulmonary capillary
wedge of 8 , arterial 110/70 , she had a 50% stenosis in her left
anterior descending , and a subtotal occlusion of her left
circumflex which was opened with PTCA to 20%. She was kept on
Heparin for another 24 hours following the PTCA and then the
Heparin was discontinued. She remained pain free after her cardiac
catheterization/PTCA and was discharged home on 8/9/96 with
follow-up with Dr. Rumphol . Her TSH level was checked given her
history of hypothyroidism and her TSH was 1.0.
DISPOSITION: Patient&apos;s hospital course was without complication.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , ECASA , 325 mg q.d. , Synthroid 125
micrograms q.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150
sublingually one tablet q.5 minutes times three , and simvastatin 20
mg q.h.s.
FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to follow-up with Dr. Stikeleather in two to
three weeks.

Discharge Date: 11/5/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: FIBROID UTERUS.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: MENORRHAGIA.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY , BILATERAL
SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43 year old gravida
V , para V with a history of
hypermenorrhea and anemia who was seen at Onfarbkern En Rush-mee Hospital May for these problems. In October of 1999 , she
had endometrial biopsy done that showed secondary endometrium. She
was prescribed Provera and oral contraceptive pills without relief.
She had a dilation and curettage performed at the Nesbot Strafound Hospital on April which showed normal pathology. She
continued bleeding and was prescribed Lupron. Office hysteroscopy
showed submucosal myomas with ultrasound showing a 2.5 x 1.8 cm
intracavitary mass. She was told she could have a hysteroscopy ,
but she is in desire to have an abdominal hysterectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , not well controlled. History
of heart murmur with normal echocardiogram
in 1996.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right herniorrhaphy in 1994.
OB: She had normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Smoking two to three cigarettes per day. Denies
alcohol. She is a recovered cocaine abuser ,
stating she has not used in six months. She had positive PPD in
the past and she was treated with INH for a year.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lupron.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/30/99 and had a
total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy with a blood loss of 300 cc. She was then
admitted to the postoperative recovery unit and then to the floor
in stable condition. On postoperative day one , she complained of a
lot of pain and was given much pain medication in response to this.
On her examination , she only had superficial tenderness to
palpation and to light to touch to skin. The patient absolutely
refused to get out of bed for the first two and a half
postoperative days. She was warned of the risk of deep venous
thrombosis and pneumonia but still refused to get out of the bed.
Her postoperative hematocrit was 28.0 , down from 30 on her
preoperative hematocrit. She complained of being unable to eat and
still refused to get out of bed on postoperative day three , so
physical therapy was consulted to help with mobilization. She did
have temperature of 101 on 7/13/99 and blood cultures , urine
culture , and CBC was sent. Her white count was 7.9. Urine cultures
were 10 , 000. The next urinalysis was negative and blood cultures
showed no growth. She continued to have temperatures without good
ambulation. A chest x-ray was performed which was clear. The
patient&apos;s affect suggested some secondary game for delaying
discharge from hospital. She was receiving empiric clindamycin and
gentamicin for approximately two days before discharge.
She had been afebrile for greater than 24 hours at the time of
discharge. A pelvic ultrasound performed on the day of discharge
was normal. She was eating well , eating French toast and eggs on
the day of discharge without problems.

ATTENDING: SIMMON , JEFFERY MD
ADDENDUM:
Addendum to discharge summary , record number #8830141 which was
dictated by Kovats , Doyle Bradly .
ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY:
NEURO: Neurology consult was obtained for increased somnolence
over the past three weeks , which was noted per the patient&apos;s son
which he thinks is a change from baseline. Neurology consult
recommended that we get an MRI/MRA of the brain with gadolinium
contrast to look for leptomeningeal disease and other sources for
increased somnolence which are treatable. They also recommended
an EEG be done. The EEG was done and showed no seizure activity.
The MRI/MRA was done and showed only a right MCA infarct , which
was known and old with no interval change. Gadolinium contrast
was not given because the patient became too agitated and was
moving too much during the study for an effective study to be
obtained. They also recommended that we check certain labs
including folate , B12 , TSH and RPR all of which were essentially
normal. TSH was elevated but patient has a history of
hypothyroidism and is on Synthroid. Neurology was consulted on
the day of discharge and they agreed that no further evaluation
of the somnolence is necessary at this time. If the somnolence
continues into the near future further evaluation may be
necessary. Leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given the lack of
new neurological findings , and since the patient is scheduled for
a PET scan of the chest to evaluate for spread of her known lung
cancer , if there is no interval change in her oncological process
the likeliness of leptomeningeal disease is quite low.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily ,
vitamin B12 1000 mcg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. daily , Niferex-150 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Senna two tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly ,
Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily , Lamictal

p.o. daily , Lidoderm 5% patch topically daily , NovoLog sliding
scale , Cymbalta 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily.
DISCHARGE EXAM: On the day of discharge , the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 96.7. She remained slightly
hypertensive with a blood pressure range of 103 to 152 systolic
and 54 to 90 diastolic. Her heart rate , respirations and oxygen
saturations were all normal. She was urinating on her own
without a Foley catheter. Her blood sugars were stable. A
one-to-one sitter which had been placed prior during her hospital
course was discontinued. Her ciprofloxacin course for her
urinary tract infection was discontinued because she had been
treated fully and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL the
extended release formulation for improved compliance and
convenience. At discharge , Ms. Klein &apos;s mental status
remained at baseline and she showed no signs of agitation at the
time of my exam.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: She has an appointment with her primary
care physician Dr. Baney , phone number is 010-743-1248 on
10/26/06 at 10:40 a.m. She also has an appointment with
Neurology Dr. Duplaga , phone number is 891-850-7392 and that is

Discharge Date:
SERVICE: CHTL MEDICAL CENTER HOSPITAL
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ASPIRATION PNEUMONITIS.
IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 43 year old man with
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , recently
discharged from Woo Ackla Beth&apos;s Hospital ICU on November , 2001 ,
who returns for hypercarbic respiratory failure , presumed due to
aspiration.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43 year old man
with a complicated past medical
history , but a recent long hospitalization during the month of September
2001. He was initially admitted to the ENT service at that time
with lingual tonsillitis that was complicated by difficulty
handling secretions. During this admission he had an episode of
desaturation which prompted transfer to the MICU on May , 2001.
He was also febrile at that time with a productive cough. He was
treated with clinda and levo and intubated on October . He had an
acute course of prolonged intubation with extubation finally on January .  Post extubation he was heavily sedated , with waxing and waning
alertness , but gradually became more able to follow commands.
The patient was discharged to Vancor on 10/10 with still some
depressed level of mental status. On the day of admission he
developed increased respiratory difficulty and increased
secretions. This was new since his discharge. He became acutely
tachypneic to the 40s and his oxygen saturation dropped into the
80s on 100% nonrebreather. His mother reported that his lungs
&quot;sounded junky.&quot; He spiked a fever. Hypotension to a systolic
blood pressure of 70 was also noted. For this reason he was
transferred to Cirygene Hospital for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
( 2 ) Status post CVA with residual
right-sided weakness. ( 3 ) Epilepsy. ( 4 ) Noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. ( 5 ) History of mitral valve repair in 1996.
( 6 ) Irritable bowel syndrome. ( 7 ) Gout. ( 8 ) History of left
atrial clot , status post thrombectomy.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lived previously in a group home and
is a nonsmoker. He has a close relationship with
his mother.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 103.2 , heart rate
100 , blood pressure 101/40.
Vent Settings: SIMV with a rate of 20 on 100% FIO2. Arterial
blood gases - pH 7.4 , pCO2 44 , PO2 120. Generally , this was an
intubated , sedated man who appeared comfortable. HEENT: Exam
unremarkable. NECK: Without jugular venous distention or
lymphadenopathy. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. LUNGS: Bronchial breath sounds bilaterally ,
right greater than left , decreased air entry on the left. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , nondistended , normoactive bowel sounds , no rebound
or guarding. EXTREMITIES: Warm with 2+ distal pulses.
LAB STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Sodium 156 , potassium 5 , chloride 117 ,
bicarb 28 , BUN 49 , creatinine 2.4 ,
glucose 171. Hematocrit 34.5 , white count 16.05 , platelets 226.
INR - 1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pulmonary. The patient arrived at the Anall Health intubated. He had a history of pulmonary hemorrhage
on his previous admission. However he was more easily extubated on
10/27/01 and after that time continued to exhibit and inability to
handle his secretions. He did , however , maintain good saturations
on progressively diminishing amounts of oxygen via nasal cannula.
By the time of discharge , he was able to maintain an adequate
oxygen saturation on room air. He underwent placement of a PEG
tube on 2/3/01 in order to feed him without aspiration after a
speech and swallow study showed that he had problems with
aspiration.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient was managed with metoprolol and
Captopril , which was titrated up during this admission. His
blood pressure was well controlled at the time of discharge. His
hypotension that characterized his presentation did not recur at
all during his hospitalization.
3. Infectious Disease. The patient was to complete a 21 day
course of vancomycin from his prior admission but had ongoing
fever and positive blood cultures for Staph epi. He completed an
additional seven days of vancomycin and was treated with Flagyl for
seven days for his aspiration pneumonia. He was briefly also
treated with ampicillin early in his hospitalization. By the time
he completed his 28 day course of vanco , the patient had
defervesced and had no signs of infection.
4. Heme. The patient came to Jeunerah Memorial Hospital
anticoagulated with Coumadin. He however was transitioned to
heparin so that he might be more able to get procedures if needed.
He continued on heparin with an easily managed PTT. After his PEG
tube placement , he was transitioned to Lovenox and Coumadin. He
will be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin. He will need to be
transitioned to Coumadin alone once his INR is therapeutic.
5. Neuro. The patient continued on his seizures medicines -
Valproic Acid and Neurontin - during his admission. He had no
evidence of seizure activity. His mental status improved
progressively after intubation , however it was clear that he had
deficits in swallowing , significant enough to require the PEG tube.
On discharge he was awake and alert and interactive.
6. Disposition. The patient was felt to benefit from acute rehab
and was transferred to rehab at the conclusion of his
hospitalization to enjoy aggressive PT and OT.

.
HPI: 83 F with hereditary angio-edema ( C1-esterase inhibitor
deficiency ) and multiple prior attacks characterized by abdominal pain
and distension and airway compromise s/p tracheostomy. She was in her
USOH until this morning when she developed worsening abdominal pain ,
periumbilical , constant. The pain was associated with abdominal
distension and typical of prior attacks. No new foods - typically these
episodes are without an identifiable precipitant. No associated
nausea/vomiting or diarrhea. + flatus , had bowel movement this AM.
Typical BM&apos;s are either watery or &quot;pencil thin&quot; due to colonic stricture
( s/p multiple dilatations. ) No respiratory distress , rash or hives.
She called her Allergist/Immunologist who advised her to take 2mg
Stanozolol ( instead of 1mg ) and come to the ED. In the past , abdominal
attacks have responded to FFP. Yet , given a history of hives to FFP , she
requires premedication with Benadryl.

Consults: Followed in-house by attg Loughman ( Allergy/Immuno )
Impression: Abdominal pain due to hereditary angioedema.
1. ALLERGY: Patient was admitted with abdominal pain that was similar in
nature to prior episodes of hereditary angioedema flare. She was treated
with ffp x 2units on admission with benadryl premedication. She did
develop a few facial hives without any respiratory distress by the end of
the second unit of FFP. This resolved after FFP infusion stopped and she
was given additional benadryl. She tolerated benadryl well , yet had a
sensation of restlessness afterwards. On 4/4 she got another 2 units FFP
with premedication of benadyrl 25 iv prior to each bag as well as ativan
0.5 mg po prior to transfusions. This was a good combination as she did
not get hives , nor the anxiety that accompanies benadryl. By 8/21 , her
abdominal distension had improved markedly and her pain had largely
subsided. Given the fact that prior episodes have taken a few days for
complete resolution of distension , she was discharged with instructions to
contact her immunologist should symptoms worsen or persist.
She will be discharged on a stanozolol taper as outlined by
allergy/immuno. Please see patient instructions full regimen.
.
During the hospital stay , she had no upper air way symptoms and was given
tracheostomy care.
.
ELEVATED HCT: On admission , HCT was 59 ( baselin is low 40&apos;s ). Part of the
elevation was attributed to intravascular volume depletion. Lasix was
held for 3 days and HCT was 42% on discharge. No prior documented history
of polycythemia. Please consider further evaluation as outpatient for
this erythrocytosis.
.
AFib: continued on digoxin and atenolol with good rate control ( HR 70-80s
throughout hospital stay. )
CODE: Discussed with patient. FULL CODE. Daughter hcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were hospitalized for abdominal pain due to your condition of
hereditary angioedema. You received a total of 4 units of FFP with
benadryl and pepcid premedication.
.
MEDICATION CHANGES:
Please continue all medications that you were on prior to this admission
with the following changes:
1. Please follow the stanozolol taper as outlined by Dr. Gehlert and
colleagues during your stay:
2 mg every 8 hours for 5/23/07 , then
2 mg every 12 hours for 10/28/07 , then
2 mg every day for 1 week , then
2 mg every other day.
Then you should adjust further as an outpatient in consultation with Dr.
Bennes .
.
Followup: schedule , with Dr. Areizaga .
Please contact Dr. Demski to discuss how you are doing.
.
CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR OR RETURN TO EMERGENCY DEPT. IF:
Your abdominal pain worsens , you become more bloated or distended , you
develop nausea , vomiting , facial swelling , difficulty breathing , or any
other concerns.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:

with one day of fever and pain around her Hickman site. The
patient was in her usual state of health the week of admission ,
but on the Friday prior to admission , she felt sick and was in
bed all day. She noticed worsening back and knee pain. That had
been present since July when she was in a motor vehicle
accident. She also felt warm to the temperature and noticed
herself to be febrile to 101 degrees. The morning of admission ,
she had worsening pain and induration around her Hickman site and
called her physician who told her to come to the Emergency
Department. On review of systems , she denied cough , sputum
production , nasal congestion , headache , chest pain , shortness of
breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , rashes ,
dysuria , increased urinary frequency or urgency.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is notable for
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hepatitis C positivity ,
aplastic anemia , transfusion dependent , acute 2 weeks , chronic
kidney disease , avascular necrosis of the hips bilaterally ,
status post bilateral total hip replacements , hepatitis B
secondary hemachromatosis and hypothyroidism and she has an
allergy to acetaminophen.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications include , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lantus 25 units q.h.s. , thiamine 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Humalog
sliding scale , folic acid 1 mg q.d. , Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
levothyroxine 75 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
methadone 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , oxycodone 98 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.
pain , quinine 260 mg q.h.s. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Zoloft 100 mg p.o. q.d. , and Compazine p.r.n. nausea.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives at home with her daughter. She does
not drink alcohol. She does not smoke tobacco.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her family history is noncontributory. In the
emergency department , blood cultures were drawn from her Hickman
line and peripherally plain films were obtained of the left knee
and the lumbar spine and she received a single dose of
vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl intravenously.
ADMISSION EXAMINATION: Her temperature was 97.8. Her heart rate
was 80. Her blood pressure was 102/68. Her respiratory rate was
16. She was satting 100% on room air. Generally , she was awake
and alert. HEENT: Mucous membranes were moist. Oropharynx was
clear , pupils equal , round and reactive to light. Her pupils
were pinpoint. Cardiovascular: JVP was at 7 cm of water ,
carotid upstrokes were brisk. Her cardiovascular exam was
regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , no rubs , murmurs or gallops.
Pulmonary: Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Her abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended. No
hepatosplenomegaly , negative Murphy&apos;s sign and she had normal
active bowel sounds. Extremities were warm and well perfused.
She had 1+ edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. She had
left medial knee tenderness but no effusion , full range of
motion. Her neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Her laboratory evaluation was notable for a
glucose of 49. Her complete blood count was notable for a white
blood count of 1.7 with an absolute neutrophil count of 735. Her
hematocrit was 26. Her platelet count was 7. Plain films
obtained of the left knee showed a stable pattern sclerosis in
the distal femur with an effusion. Plain films of the L-spine
showed no fracture or other pathology.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Her blood cultures.
1. ID , her blood cultures grew out coag-negative staphylococcus.
Her Hickman line was pulled and thought to be the source of
infection. She was started on vancomycin intravenously to
complete a 2-week course of vancomycin.
2. Musculoskeletal , the patient had has chronic hip and knee
pain secondary to avascular necrosis and also from her MVA that
she experienced , which likely exacerbated the pain. The
patient&apos;s pain seemed to be out of control throughout the
admission. Anesthesia was consulted and the patient was treated
with a fentanyl PCA. She was also continued on her home dose of
methadone 40 t.i.d. with oxycodone for breakthrough. Toward the
end of the admission , the patient was thought to be somnolent ,
perhaps over sedated from narcotics. Her medication regimen was
titrated back down to her home regimen versus the methadone 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d. and her oxycodone was titrated down to 60 mg q.8h p.
r.n. , breakthrough pain.
3. Heme , the patient has a history of aplastic anemia. She was
transfused blood for hematocrit less than 25. Furthermore upper
extremity noninvasive vascular studies were obtained to rule out
subclavian clot associated with her prior Hickman and that study
was negative. The decision was made to transfuse platelets only
if the patient was actively bleeding , which she was not.
4. Endocrine: Throughout the patient&apos;s admission , her blood
sugars were somewhat difficult to control having episodes of both
hyper and hypoglycemia. The patient was discharged on the
following regimen NPH 34 units in the morning with Humalog
sliding scale with the plan for her to follow up with her primary
physician in office to further adjust her insulin scale. She was
continued on her Synthroid at 75 mg q.d. for hypothyroidism , this
was not initially during this admission.
5. Cardiovascular system: The patient has a history of
hypertension. She was continued on her lisinopril 20 mg q.d. ,
and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient had pneumoboots for DVT
prophylaxis.
7. FEN: The patient was had her nutrition supplemented with
multivitamin , thiamine and folate.
8. GI: The patient was on GI prophylaxis with Nexium and was
given Colace as a stool softener versus her narcotics.
9. The patient was full code during this admission.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of
neutropenia and Hickman line infection. She was completed a
course of intravenous vancomycin for coag-negative staphylococcus
bacteremia , which ended on 6/5/05 . Prior to her discharge , she
had a tunneled catheter placed by general surgery , procedure ,
which she tolerated well. Please see separate operative report.
The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. Biagioni in his

Discharge Date: 10/11/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LYMPHOMA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43-year-old with
an FUO recently admitted for further
work-up of fever. Approximately 12 weeks ago , the patient noted
the onset of fevers , intermittent to 102 or 103 , nonproductive
cough , arthralgias , myalgias , sweats and chills. There was some
diffuse abdominal pain. The patient has had recurrent fevers and
was admitted to Un Dell Nimay Memorial Hospital on 12/10/91 for a
work-up. This together with SH work-up has been fairly
extensive. He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and
five days ago after afebrile days , he began having fevers again. He
was admitted at this time for further work-up. He has had three
episodes of nausea and vomiting during the febrile episodes in the
last week. He has been passing gas and has been constipated. He
also noted a productive cough. HIV risk factors were negative.
Work-up has included chest CT which revealed enlarged diaphragmatic
lymph nodes , coronary artery calcium deposits and two small liver
cysts. Pelvic CT revealed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with a
second cecum. Chest x-ray was normal. Testicular ultrasound
revealed no masses. Abdominal ultrasound was normal with ectatic
aorta. Upper GI series revealed nodularity to the mucosa within
the gastric antrum , question focal gastritis. Endoscopy with
biopsy revealed gastritis , no evidence of malignancy. Serology
revealed hepatitis A IgM antibody negative , hepatitis A IgG
antibody positive , hepatitis surface antigen negative , rubella
immune , RPR negative , Toxo negative , CMV negative , HSV positive
( old infection ). Lyme titer was 11.7 ( normal is 0-9 ). PPD was
negative. SPEP normal. AFP , beta hCG , CEA negative. Malaria
screens were negative. B-12 and folate were normal. HIV was
negative. Multiple blood and urine cultures all negative.
ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN. MEDICATIONS: On admission included
Tylenol and Percocet.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a temperature of
103.4. HEENT exam was within normal limits.
Lungs were clear. Neck was supple with no jugular venous
distention , there was some shotty lymphadenopathy. Cardiac exam
revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or
gallops. Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds , some mild
tenderness , question enlarged liver edge. There was positive
inguinal lymphadenopathy. Extremities revealed no clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema , positive lichen planus. Neurological exam was
nonfocal. Rectal exam was deferred.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by both Infectious
Disease Service and Hematology Oncology Service.
The patient had an ANA which was negative. Rheumatoid factor was
negative. Lyme titer was 4.5. Hepatitis C was negative. CT scan
of the abdomen and pelvis done on 10/11 showed essentially no change
with multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes , possible increased size
of the left external inguinal lymph node. The ultrasound of the
abdomen was negative for gallstones or biliary duct dilatation but
showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 2.5 cm. The patient had a
bone marrow biopsy which showed large atypical cells infiltrating
with fibrosis , a picture consistent with Hodgkin&apos;s disease
involving the bone marrow. The patient had defervesced and was
scheduled for discharge on the day which the bone marrow biopsy
results were received. He was informed of the diagnosis and is to
follow-up with Dr. Dallmann on an outpatient basis.

Discharge Date: 3/19/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Mr. Coxum is a 60-year-old man
admitted to the MICU on 3/1 in the
setting of massive hemoptysis. He has an 80 pack year history of
smoking. He was noted to have upper respiratory symptoms three
days prior to admission. One day prior to admission , he had some
pink sputum and shortness of breath. He was admitted to Cox Hospital
with possible COPD flare. At that time , he had massive hemoptysis ,
was intubated and transferred to BUOHC for further management.
Initially , he was seen by anesthesia and intubated with a double
lumen ETT for airway protection. He was taken to the O.R. the
following day and found to have an endobronchial lesion at the left
bifurcation of the upper and lower lobes. Samples were taken which
subsequently revealed clot. An endobronchial blocker was placed.
He had no further episodes of hemoptysis. On 3/15 , he had a
bronchoscopic Wang needle biopsy which was nondiagnostic but showed
cells suspicious for non small cell lung cell cancer versus
squamous metaplasia. He was easily extubated in the evening of
3/15 without event.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes , alcohol , PAF , BPH ,
glaucoma , osteoarthritis , DVTs , CVA of total
right internal carotid and 80% of the left internal carotid artery ,
pilonidal cyst.
ALLERGIES: To Keflex.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Zestril 30 , NPH , aspirin.
MEDS ON TRANSFER: Also include Diltiazem , levo. and prednisone ,
Nexium , Nitropaste , trazodone , Ativan , Heparin ,
Zestril.
SOCIAL HISTORY: 80 pack years of tobacco. Alcohol in the past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. Pulmonary: The patient had no
repeat episodes of hemoptysis on this
admission. He received a total body bone scan with no skeletal
metastasis found. CT of the chest on 2/10 revealed consolidation
improved since admission , no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy
and low attenuation areas of enlargement within both adrenal
glands , unchanged from the admission CT. An abdominal CT showed
calcified gallstone , a left apical adrenal nodule needing further
imaging and a tiny , hypoattenuating liver lesion in the right liver
lobe. A CT scan of the head was negative for metastasis disease.
Because of the finding in the adrenal glands , an MRI of the abdomen
without contrast was also completed on the day prior to discharge.
Results of the study are pending. The case was discussed with Dr.
Doogan and Dr. Amoa and Dr. Hartt at length. It was decided
that if there was no evidence of metastatic disease , the patient
would possibly be offered left upper lobectomy for both diagnostic
and therapeutic purposes. If there were evidence of metastatic
disease on biopsy of a visible adrenal nodule , then potential
medical therapy would include chemotherapy and radiation. The
patient did well on the floor with O2 sats remaining in the upper
90s on room air. At one point , two days prior to discharge , he did
develop some mild inspiratory stridor. There was a question of
aspiration pneumonia; however , chest PA and lateral was negative.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient developed atrial fibrillation in
the setting of hemoptysis. He was loaded with IV amiodarone and
subsequently returned to normal sinus rhythm. He was on
maintenance dose of 200 mg p.o. q. d. and remained in normal sinus
rhythm. He also had hypertension and was started on Captopril and
Lopressor for better blood pressure control. Amiodarone will
likely be stopped at the time of discharge.
3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable throughout hospital course.
4. ID: The patient has been on levo. and Flagyl for presumed
aspiration pneumonia. He completed a two week course of these
medications. PPD was negative. BAL was negative for infectious
organisms.
5. GI: Was on Nexium for GI prophylaxis. Because the patient was
intubated for several days , he had significant swallowing
difficulties with possible aspiration. A video fluoroscopy study
revealed penetration and aspiration of all consistencies secondary
to decreased epiglottic deflection and moderate residue in the
piriform sinuses. Thus the patient received an NG tube and
received all feeds and pills through it. He is to remain NPO until
a repeat video fluoroscopy is performed.
6. Heme: The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells
during his stay and his hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
7. Endocrine: The patient required high doses of insulin , notably
80 in the a.m. and 85 in the p.m. with some breakthrough doses of
insulin as well.
8. Vascular: On the day of discharge , the patient was noted to
have bilateral ankle swelling. However in the setting of normal
creatinine , normal albumin of 3.9 and an echocardiogram with a
normal EF , this was not thought to be cardiovascular or renal in
origin. Furthermore , the patient had no tenderness to palpation
and no pain. LENIs were considered.
Thus the patient was discharged on 8/20/02 in the morning with
follow-up with Dr. Wickett and Dr. Alba .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Artificial tears two drops o.u. t.i.d. ,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. d. , folate 1 mg p.o.
q. d. , NPH 85 units in the morning and 80 units in the evening ,

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
this very pleasant 54yo with a history of NIDDM failure of other
conventional methods of weight loss , underwent a laparoscopic adjustable
gastric band placement without complication. The pt was transferred to
the PACU in stable condition. Her pain was well controlled with PCA
analgesia on POD0 and transitioned to po elixir analgesia following a
negative upper GI studfy exhibiting no leaks. Her diet was advanced from
NPO to stage 2 post gastric banding diet , which she tolerated with no
nausea/vomiting. On POD 1 the surgical site was examined and there were
no signs of hematoma. The pt remained hemodynamically stable and was
making good urine. At the time of discharge the pt&apos;s pain was well
controlled and she was tolerating a stage 2 diet and was afebrile with
all incisions were clean dry and intact. Pt is being sent home on roxicet
and ranitidine elixir as wel as a course of qugmentin suspension as well
as previous home medications.
She will follow up her diabetes in DM clinic as previously arranged and
will take only her lantus in the interim.

Discharge Date: 9/27/1992
CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41
year old female who is status post
L5-S1 fusion in 22 of August , who complains of right greater than left
bilateral leg pain with moderate LS spine spasms in the same
distribution as before the first surgery ( S1 area ). She has had
epidural steroid injections during the past year and had no relief
of these symptoms. She is presently unable to work for the past 6
weeks. She has been on bedrest for most of the day. She has
minimal relief with non steroidals. She is here for a second
diskectomy after demonstration on CT of marked recurrence on the
right to just above the mid line. She donated 1 unit of autologous
blood. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noteable for the patient having had
difficulty maintaining IV&apos;s in the past. She also had urinary
retention after her last surgery. She is otherwise healthy. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post L5-S1 diskectomy in 3 of June status
post tubal ligation; status post cholecystectomy; C. section x 2
and tonsillectomy and appendectomy. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Percocet 4-8 per day. ALLERGIES: NKDA.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The heart exam was within
normal limits. The belly exam was benign. The orthopedic exam was
noteable for an old well healed surgical scar in the mid line of
the low back. She had a very limited range of motion of the back
secondary to pain. She was tender over L4-S1 centrally. She had
bilateral sciatic notch tenderness , right greater than left. She
had positive straight leg raising sign at 60 degrees on the right
and 80 degrees on the left. She had positive bowstring sign on the
right. She had decreased light touch sensation on the right
lateral thigh , lower leg and foot and otherwise was normal.
Reflexes demonstrated right 2+ at the knee and 2+ at the ankle
compared to 3+ at the knee on the left and 2+ of the ankle. The
toes were bilaterally downgoing. There was no clonus bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was operated on on the day of
admission undergoing a re-do of L5-S1 disk and
L5-S1 posterior lateral fusion with right iliac crest bone graft
taken through the same incision. The patient tolerated this
procedure well. Postoperatively , her hospital course went as
follows by systems: 1 ) NEUROLOGIC-The patient continued to have
some degree of pain that was noted on weight bearing of the lateral
aspect of the right thigh but not progressing much further beyond
that towards the foot as it had preoperatively. The intensity of
this pain was also somewhat less than it was preoperatively. There
were no significant symptoms on the left. She also had the expected
surgical pain. 2 ) RESPIRATORY-There were no significant issues.
The patient did have the history of mild childhood asthma and
perioperatively she did demonstrate some end expiratory wheezes
that were treated with Ventolin and Albertol inhaler treatents.
These were resolved by the time of discharge. Her O2 saturations
were well maintained throughout her hospital stay. 3 )
CARDIAC-There were no significant issues. 4 ) GI/NUTRITIONAL-The
patient had no significant problems. She had a bowel movement
prior to discharge. Her diet was advanced without difficulty.
5 ) RENAL/ELECTROLYTE-The patient was able to void when her Foley
was discontinued on postoperative day 4. Electrolytes were followed
and treated on prn basis. 6 ) HEMOLOGIC-The patient required
transfusion of her 1 unit of autologous blood. Subsequently , with
the patient on Iron Gluconate and Colace , her hematocrit came from
25 after her unit of blood up to 29.1 on her last check prior to
discharge. She will be on iron for 1 month postoperatively. The
patient was maintained on compression boots postoperatively until
she was up and walking more independently. 7 ) INFECTIOUS
DISEASE-There were no significant itssues. 8 ) ORTHOPEDIC-Her
wound showed excellent signs of healing postoperatively. There was
no evidence of infection at any time and her flaps looked viable at
all times. Her postoperative neurologic status was as described
above. The patient was given an Orthomol brace which she is to
wear at all times whenever out of bed.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. RECURRENT RIGHT L5-S1 DISK.
2. HISTORY OF PHLEBITIS AND DIFFICULTY WITH
IV&apos;S.
PROCEDURES: Re-do right L5-S1 diskectomy and L5-S1 posterolateral
fusion with right iliac crest bone graft on October ,

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
59 yo F with DM , HTN , OSA , s/p CVA admitted for
hypoxia to 70s. She experienced similar SOB on prior
episodes. She has had no CP. Her SOB is primarily related to her body
habitus.
IN AHS ED , hypoxic to 80s on RA , up to 90s on 3L NC. Had clear CXR ,
Patient&apos;s prior PE protocol was negitive though she did have a positive
D-Dimer. In ED EKG was w/ inf lat ST segment depressoions that were
unchanged from prior. She also has LA enlargement. While in ED patient&apos;s
troponin returned 1.64 ( prior less than assay a couple of days PTA ).

2/2 OSA here w/ likely demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoxia.* Pulm HTN
is also a possibility as a cause for her desaturation and SOB , but past

treatment now seems to be good respiratory rehab , use of CPAP in PM and
ultimately weight reduction.

Hospital course by problem:
1 ) CP: Pt with story unlikely to be cardiac origin but has RF for
ischemia in HTN. No sig fhx. Rule out by enzymes. CT chest in ED neg
for PE or dissection. Was kept on BBlock after admission , bu
t c/o feeling heavy and noted significant Bradycardia overnight to
48-52. BBlock was then DC&apos;d and BP was controlled with hctz. On HD#2
Pt w/ episode CP and weakness. No EKG changes on R or L EKG. Pain did
not resolve after 3 nitro. Pt received MSO4 1mg and Maalox with
complete resolution of pain and weakness; no further sx for the rest
of the day. Given likely poor exercise tolerance ETT was changed to
Dobutamine-MIBI 10/20 .  MIBI was read as negative. DC&apos;d to home with
ECASa , lisinopril , verapamil , hctz.
2 ) HTN: Pt on Verapimil and Lisinopril at home. Had tried Maxzide in
past but did not tolerate. Given &quot;weakness&quot; sx , B blocker dc&apos;d.
Started HCTZ for long term management of HTN. Verapamil 480 mg also
split into BID dosing. KDur rx&apos;d for hypokalemia.
DC&apos;d to home with f/u by PMD in 1-2 weeks , bp check and k check.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your dobutamine stress test was negative for coronary disease. Take
your blood pressure medications as prescribed. Please take the
verapamil 240 mg twice a day. Continue to take the hctz in the
morning. HCT will lower potassium low , so we have started a low dose of
potassium in pill form every day. Please make an appointment to see
Dr. Kosky within 1-2 weeks for a check of your blood pressure and your
potassium. You may try maalox for your chest pain , but if it worsens or
you have significant shortness of breath , come to hospital or call MD

Discharge Date: 7/27/2006
ATTENDING: PROWELL , RODRIGO TYLER M.D.
SERVICE: GMS Ank Thay Nage intern.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Seizure and urosepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 75-year-old female with history
of left MCA stroke with residual right-sided weakness , vascular
dementia , insulin-dependent diabetes , CAD with recent admission
for proteus UTI , admitted with mental status changes , possible
tonic-clonic seizure , new atrial fibrillation with RVR , and
hypotension in setting of presumed urosepsis. The patient
presented from her nursing home on responses status post witness
seizure activity and new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR. The
patient recently admitted on 10/22 with proteus UTI requiring
intubation , discharged to rehabilitation and extensive courses of
cefpodoxime. As per the EMS , the patient had tonic-clonic
seizure activity with tachycardiac to 180s and desaturated to
70%. Notable studies at that time , chest x-ray without obvious
infiltrate , head CT without acute changes or left MCA territory
infarct was noted. Urinalysis is notable for grossly infected
urine. The patient was admitted to the MICU where the patient
was aggressively resuscitated with normalization of blood
pressure. The patient&apos;s urine culture grew enterococcus and she
was treated with ceftazidime and vancomycin given her history of
MRSA and proteus UTI. The patient was weight controlled with IV
Lopressor and transferred to GMS service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As follows , left MCA stroke , which
resulted in visible right-sided weakness and dysarthria ,
insulin-dependent diabetes , neuropathy , nephropathy , CAD. The
MIBI was on done in 3/3 , which showed a reversible anteroapical
defect , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , status post
right fifth toe amputation , status post left fem bypass , also
vascular dementia , chronic kidney disease with creatinines of
1.8-2 , GERD , cataracts , depression , venous insufficiency with
right heel ulcer , left heel ulcer with underlying osteomyelitis ,
angina , status post right mastectomy for distant breast cancer ,
status post cholecystectomy , TAH , open distal right tibial
fracture in 11/24 .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 83 , blood pressure is
ranging from 110-150/70-80 , O2 sat 100% on room air. She has
regular rate and rhythm in sinus. Extremity exam is notable for
2+ edema bilaterally right greater than left , upper arm erythema
near her PICC site , which is not new. Heel dressings clean , dry ,
and intact. Neuro exam was notable for baseline right
hemiparesis and aphasia. Pupils of left are greater than right.
Left is surgical pupils and both reactive. At baseline , she has
repetitive speech and also had a history of screaming when wake
at night that can be sued by direction with people.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. ID: Admitted with urosepsis , afebrile , leukocytosis
resolving , and urine culture from admit not growing
enterococcus-VRE on IV Linezolid for better absorption.
Instruction: Finished 14-day course of Linezolid today day six.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydro , patient incontinent ,
passing urine , has been afebrile with normal white blood cell
count and blood pressure.
2. CV: Ischemia: History of CAD , enzymes negative x3 here.
Had ST depressions on EKG initially. EKG is normal since
continue aspirin , statin beta-blocker , pump. No known history of
CHF , EF 55% , total body fluid overloaded. We have restarted
Lasix 20 daily , blood pressures had been elevated. The patient
is treated right now with Lopressor , Catapres patch versus
currently 12.5 mg t.i.d. Instruction: Please titrate as
necessary to home dose of Toprol XL 50 daily. Instruction:
Continue clonidine patch , add Imdur as necessary. Rate: Atrial
fibrillation with RVR visit admit likely secondary to sepsis has
been in normal sinus. No Coumadin now. Rate controlled with IV
Lopressor and on aspirin 81. If the patient is in paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation can consider increasing to aspirin 325 mg
later in a week.
3. Neuro: Possible seizures secondary to urosepsis. EEG
negative for epileptic form activity , but the patient is
currently on Dilantin for goal equal to 10 , last level was 8.7
corrected for albumin is 13.5 , currently on Dilantin 100 mg
t.i.d. Instructions: We checked Dilantin level in one week -
history of CVA , left MCA stroke , has right-sided weakness not
new. Question of new stroke clinically on 11/24 was seen by
Neurology , but they think most likely just Haldol effect and type
of old left MCA stroke. The patient with improved exam in 7/28 ,
so no MRI indicated in the future. The patient does require MRI ,
must get consent from family , discussed with her orthopedist and
radiology. The pain is in her right foot and contact Dr. Julian E Charbonnel from ortho at Blantonain Hospital , 126-888-6789.
Mental status remains poor and per the patient&apos;s husband the
patient is intermittently conversant at home and occasionally
screams at rehab. Give Haldol if the patient inconsolable. Home
regimen was Remeron , Prozac , and Seroquel. We have held the
Remeron to do its interaction with clonidine and it is decreased
after she had the clonidine for hypertension and also had held
Prozac which has caused serotonin syndrome with the Linezolid on
board. Instructions: Consider restarting these antidepressants
once off Linezolid. Instructions: The patient takes meds. If
husband around so may want at time p.o. meds around this.
4. Heme: The patient has been PF4 positive , but platelets are
normal.

Discharge Date: 9/22/2003
Date of Discharge: 9/22/2003
ATTENDING: SYDNEY VELOVIC MD
SERVICE: Chief Surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old male
who presented to his primary care doctor in early September with
dysphagia and acolasia and epigastric pain. He had an upper
endoscopy which showed an ulcer in the distal esophagus and
proximal stomach. He had a repeat EGD and biopsies of the ulcer
which showed adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach and distal
esophagus. Metastatic workup showed only thickening at the GE
junction and one enlarged lymph node in the periportal region 3.4
x 1.6 cm. The patient was referred to Dr. Dunks for resection
and was planned for an esophagectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history includes
hypertension , ischemic cardiomyopathy , noninsulin dependent
diabetes , kidney stones , status post laser lithotripsy , history
of hyponatremia , myocardial infarction six years ago ,
hypercholesterolemia , and an infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Prevacid 30 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg q.day ,
Toprol-XL 50 mg q.day , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , Zestril 5 mg
q.day , aspirin 325 mg q.day and Coumadin alternating 5 and 2.5 mg
p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient came into the hospital , after
admission was taken to the operating room on 9/5/03 . In the
operating room he underwent exploratory laparotomy biopsy of a
portacaval lymph node. Uterolithotomy on the right side , liver
biopsy , cystoscopy , placement of double J ureteral stent on the
right side and open nephrolithotomy. The large right ureteral
stone was found upon exploration and urology was called for an
intraoperative consult. Please see both Dr. Moriarity and Dr.
Cushard dictated reports for more information. There was a
very high amount of blood loss approximately 17 liters
intraoperatively from venous plexus bleeding of the pelvis and
kidney and the patient was closed after stomach mobilization
without resection of his tumor and admitted to the Angeles Vandie Morepa surgical
intensive care unit. The patient was left intubated due to his
large fluid and blood product replacement and surrounding facial
edema. He was kept intubated , paralyzed and sedated , started on
Lopressor , put on a rule out MI protocol , kept NPO with an
NG-tube. His electrolytes , CBC and coagulation labs were
corrected. The patient had multiple abdominal drains and was
kept on triple antibiotics. Over the next several days , the
patient was kept intubated and sedated. His chest x-rays
revealed some early ARDS and he continued to need blood product
including red cell and platelet and FFP transfusions. He
underwent bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit and was slowly
weaned on his valve dilatory settings. Over postop day 4 , 5 and
6 the patient began to spike some fevers up to 102. He had been
weaned to pressure support ventilation and was beginning to auto
diurese. He then started on tube feeds of small amounts which
were increased as tolerated.
Over the next couple of days as the patient&apos;s sedation was weaned
and he woke up more , it was noticed that he had decreased
movement of his left lower extremity and upon examination and
given his recurrent fevers , there was a question of an epidural
hematoma. He was scheduled for an MRI to assess this. He was
tolerating tube feeds well and these were increased and his labs
were stabilizing. Neurosurgery was consulted and it was
ascertained that the patient did have an epidural hematoma ,
therefore his epidural was removed and this was deemed likely to
be secondary to trauma from the epidural. It was decided that
the patient would benefit from evacuation of epidural hematoma
and the patient was made NPO and taken back to the operating room
on 8/18/03 . He underwent a T5-T8 laminectomy with evacuation of
the epidural hematoma. Please see the dictated operative report
for more information , but a handful of clot was removed from the
area. The patient was transferred back to Or Ox Nor , intubated and
stable having tolerated the procedure well.
Thereafter , the patient was more awake and alert and more quickly
weaned off his ventilatory support. His fingersticks were more
difficult to control and he was therefore started on the
Heartland protocol and was seen by the Diabetes Management
Service. The patient was extubated on 9/11/03 and was doing well
on a face mask on that day. His tube feeds were restarted and
speech and swallow was consulted to evaluate the patient. He
began to be seen by physical therapy for his lower extremity
weakness. The Cardiology Service was consulted on 8/18 and asked
to optimize medical management of the patient&apos;s ischemic
cardiomyopathy. They recommended discontinuing and titrating the
patient&apos;s Lopressor. He had been somewhat tachycardic previously
and this resolved shortly. Speech and swallow saw the patient
and initially cleared him for soft foods and thickened foods and
this was likely just due to endotracheal tube trauma. After
another day or two they cleared him for all regular foods
including thin liquids without any restrictions.
For the patient&apos;s epidural hematoma , he had been started on
Vancomycin and it was decided that he would get a total of a
three week course of Vancomycin. Urology continued to followed
the patient and wanted at least one Blake drain kept in place and
the Foley catheter kept in place. The patient did have a CT scan
on 10/19/03 which demonstrated no urine leak on the CT urogram.
The patient continued to be seen by physical therapy every day
and was doing very well. It was very difficulty initially to
normalize him but by the time of discharge he was up walking with
the walker with physical therapy and doing quite well.
Infectious disease was consulted to confirm the three week course
of Vancomycin was appropriate for the patient&apos;s epidural
hematoma , and they agreed and thought no other interventions or
treatment as needed at the time. The patient was transferred out
of the intensive care unit on 10/19/03 .
Neuro: At this time he was getting increasingly more oriented.
He had had some ICU psychosis and confusion and he was taking no
pain medication. He was stable from his neurosurgery procedure
and neurosurgery was following him.
Pulmonary: His lungs were clear. He was now stable on room air.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , he was stable and continued on
his low dose Lopressor.
Gastroenterology: He was tolerating a house diet , eating small
amounts.
GU: As stated , the urologist wanted to keep the Foley catheter
and keep one of the Blake drains upon discharge.
From a hematology standpoint , the patient had a stable
hematocrit. From an infectious disease standpoint , the patient
was continued on IV Vancomycin for three weeks. He had a PICC
line placed on 9/22/03 which was put in good position.
From an endocrine standpoint , he was placed on glyburide ,
continued to be followed by diabetes and also on a humalog scale.
From an activity standpoint , he was seen by physical therapy
every day.
Over the ensuing few days he was begun on calorie counts to see
how much of the diet he was tolerating and he continued to work
with physical therapy. His glyburide and insulin doses were
tweaked a little bit by the diabetes management service and he
was improving every day as was his mental status. He had been
discharged from the unit with a one-to-one sitter but this was
very soon thereafter stopped on 10/21/03 . He was stable medically
about 3/11 or 2/4/03 for discharge and was ______ for a
rehabilitation facility appropriately. He was accepted to a
rehab facility near his home on 5/16/03 , Dis University Hospital and was ready
to go.
From a neurologic standpoint , he is awake and oriented x3 most of
his time. His back limbs are stable. The staples have been
removed by neurosurgery and he will follow up with Dr. Ochwat
from Neurosurgery in a couple of weeks. From a cardiovascular
standpoint , he has been restarted on all of his home medications
and his blood pressure and heart rate had been stable on those.
From a pulmonary standpoint , he currently has no issues and is
breathing well on room air. From a GI standpoint , he is
tolerating an ADA diet with diabetic booster , Ensure and has been
eating fairly well the last couple of days. From a GU
standpoint , he is urinating sufficiently and he will keep his
Foley catheter and Blake drain. From an endocrine standpoint , he
is on glyburide twice a day and twice a day fingersticks with
humalog sliding scale. From an infectious disease standpoint , he
has a well functioning PICC and has been fine and will begin on
Vancomycin for a total of three weeks. Today , 5/16/03 is day 8 of
21 of the Vancomycin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: On physical exam , the patient
is awake and oriented in no acute distress. His lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. His heart is regular , rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft , nontender ,
nondistended with a well healing midline incision scar with some
Steri-Strips still in place. He has one Blake drain in place on
the right side which is functioning well. His extremities have
no edema and his Foley catheter is in place and working well.

Plan:
- Chest pain ( I ): CAD s/p CABG , DM. High risk w/ inc SOB. Not
convincing for unstable angina but having progressive SOB. ECG
changes nonspecific , not concerning as noted on multiple prior EKG&apos;s.
Cont ASA , BB , ARB , statin. Noted to be hypertensive during hospital stay
with SBP&apos;s in 130-160. HR 60-80s. Will discharge on increased dose of
atenolol ( 100 mg daily instead of 75 mg daily. )
( P ): Repeat echo for progressive SOB. ddCHF. Preserved EF. No wall motion
abnormalities or changes suggestive of worsening systolic/diastolic
function or ischemia. Discharge on home lasix with standing potassium
supplementation.
( R ): Sinus rhythm. No events on telemetry. T waves in V1-V2 originally
noted varied from flat to slightly negative. No other dynamic changes.
.
COUGH: Patient gives a history of chronic cough that has recently
involved sputum production and low grade fever. Her symptoms are
consistent with a viral bronchitis with some reactive airway disease.
She got relief from duoneb and was discharged with a new albuterol
inhaler. She will also be treated with an empiric course of protonix to
treat reflux which may exacerbate reactive airway disease or in itself
cause night time cough. There was no evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
-Sputum gram stain and culture pending at discharge.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted with concerning changes on your EKG and chest pressure.
Numerous studies were performed and show that your heart gets adequate
blood flow during rest and exercise. You did not have any evidence of
heart attack either. Your cough and chest discomfort are most likely due
to an upper respiratory tract infection. This may also make your asthma
worse. We would recommend using your asthma inhaler during the day for
cough and wheeze. Also we would recommend trying a low dose of stomach
acid reducer ( protonix ) as acid reflux can also make cough worse.
.
KEY MEDICATION CHANGES:
Continue all medicines that you were taking before with the following
changes:
1. Atenolol. Take 100 mg daily ( increase from 75 mg daily. ) You were
noted to have high blood pressure even on your current dose.
2. Prilosec. Take as directed for 2 weeks. This may help your chronic
cough.
3. Albuterol inhaler ( Ventolin. ) Please take as directed.
4. Robitussion , sugar free. Take as directed for cough.
.
Please return to your doctor to check in on how you are doing in the next
2 weeks. Return to the ER if you are having difficulty breathing ,
recurrent chest pain , or other concerning symptoms.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Followup sputum gram stain/culture.
2. Blood pressure check on increased dose atenolol.
3. Cough: improved on albuterol inhaler and proton-pump inhibitor?

Discharge Date: 5/25/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year-old male who
presents to the Wek Bri Medical Center Emergency Department with low back pain and a five day
history of hemoptysis. The patient has an extensive psychiatric
history and an apparent history of tuberculosis treated in 1987 for
one year ( confirmation of this fact is not found at the present
time ). The patient presents with a five day history of hemoptysis.
The patient notes that he has had blood tinged sputum and
occasional bright red blood for the past five days totalling about
1/8th of a cup a day. He denies any fevers , chills or other sputum
production , but he notes a positive cough. He is homeless and was
exposed to cold and rain during the past week. He has had no
tuberculosis follow-up since 1988. The patient also has
long-standing lower back pain. He had a previous accident where he
was pinned between two cars at age 17. He has had pain in his
lower lumbar spine and occasional sharp pain that radiates down
both legs. He notes no weakness in his lower extremities , no
incontinence. This pain has increased substantially over the past
two months. The patient has noted an extensive psychiatric
history , evidently followed by Dr. Ruedy at the Acjames General Medical Center at the Albriel Health Care Services ( number 184-4108. ) The
patient was apparently diagnosed with paranoid schizoid
disorder vs. bipolar vs. schizophrenia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Tuberculosis , status post treatment
possibly for one year in 1987 , though no
confirmation of this has been found. 2 ) Psychiatric disorder. 3 )
Status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Prolixin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Depakote 500 mg p.o. q. AM , 1 , 000 mg
p.o. q.h.s. 3 ) Cogentin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 96.7 degrees ,
heart rate 100 , blood pressure 130/80. Head
and neck examination revealed that the pupils were equal , round and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. There was
no scleral icterus. Oropharynx was clear. Neck was supple without
any adenopathy , no jugular venous pressure was noted.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a two
out of six holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex , no S3 or S4.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was obese ,
soft , non-tender , positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed no
clubbing , cyanosis or edema noted. There were good peripheral
pulses. On rectal examination , the patient had good tone and was
guaiac negative. Neurologically , the patient was intact. On
admission , the patient received a chest x-ray which showed a
possible ground glass infiltrate in the right medial segment of the
upper lung field approximately 1 cm in size , otherwise clear lung
fields.
LABORATORY: The patient&apos;s laboratory examinations on admission
were all within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out
tuberculosis and was subsequently kept in the
respiratory isolation room and serial induced sputums were sent for
culture and stain and noted to be negative for acid fast
bacilli or other signs of tuberculosis. The patient was also noted to have no
further signs of hemoptysis while he was in the
hospital and therefore his history of hemoptysis has not been
verified. The patient was very cooperative while in the hospital
and showed no signs of being febrile or other signs of active
infection. No other signs of pulmonary
infection were identified that could account for hemoptysis.
It also did not appear that the patient had any form of possible lung
malignancy because he did not report weight loss or other suggestive features
To further work-up this up however , the patient
received a spiral CT scan of his chest which showed no focal
abnormalities and was notable for clear lung fields and no signs of
tuberculosis. As this was the case , the patient was subsequently
discharged home having been ruled out for tuberculosis. Notable
also , his PPD was negative at 48 hours with a positive mumps and
Candida anergy panel also suggestive of not having tuberculosis.
The patient was evaluated by Psychiatry while inhouse who was in
touch with his primary psychiatrist. The patient was continued on
his medications and noted to be quite stable while he was in the
hospital. He was deemed not medically able to make his own
decisions on admission and was therefore not allowed to leave
when the patient tried to leave on the night of admission. He was
very cooperative however over the course of his admission and was
followed by Psychiatry who have arranged follow-up with him upon
discharge. The patient was seen by Social Work who is actively
working with him to establish a shelter or other place to stay upon
discharge. The patient is amendable to this and anxious to receive
assistance. The patient was subsequently discharged on July , 1997 in good condition with the name and addresses of possible
places to stay and close follow-up with a social worker and his
psychiatrist.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Cogentin 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Depakote 100 mg p.o. q. AM , 200 mg p.o.
q.h.s. 3 ) Prolixin. 4 ) Tylenol p.r.n. back pain.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
cc: chest pain
HPI: This is a 75 yo woman with h/o DMII , CAD. Over past 2-3 months
the patient has had burning epigastric pain. Previous anginal chest
pain per pt. was chest tightness , but given her history of CAD her
epigastric pain has been investigated for an ischemic cause. The
patient underwent PET CT 2 months prior that revealed an LvEF of 70% ,
no wall motion abnormalities , and inferiolateral and basal
anterolateral wall ischemia ( reversible at rest ) , in the distribution
of the LCx. She presented to her PCP 12/10 to review these findings and
complained of current epigastric burning. She was sent as a direct
admit for evaluation of ischemia and possible catheterization.
PMH: GERD , HTN , DMII , CAD LAD/Lcx/OM , CVA

98 allergies: NKDA
SH: does not smoke or drink Exam: Tm AF P 46 , BP 138/70 sat
99%RA PE: notable for physiologic split S2 ,
prominent S2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops , o/w normal
exam. EKG: old 1mm st depressions v4-6 ,
I. Labs: troponin &lt; assay.
Impression: This is a 75 yo woman with multivessel CAD with epigastric
burning , possibly GERD but given risk for ischemia and positive PET
CT deserves diagnostic catherization and intervention to relieve any
pain caused by ischemia.
Hospital Course.
1. card - ischemia: The patient ruled out for acute myocardial
infarction by EKG and cardiac biomarkers. She was continued on her
outpatient regimen of ASA/BB/statin/ACEI/plavix. Left heart
catheterization performed 10/25 shows LCx disease with an 80% mid LCx
lesion opened to 0% with TAXUS stenting. Additionally , a TAXUS stent
was applied to an 80% ostial occlusion of the OM1 with no residual
occlusion. RCA disease was present with proximal 40% and ostial
50% occlusions that required no intervention.
During the procedure the patient experienced bradycardia to 38 and
SBP 86. IV fluids were given with recovery of systolic pressure to 90 -
150s , and HR 40s. The patient was asymptomatic during this event , and

Discharge Date: 10/3/2005
ATTENDING: KELLEY , IRWIN M.D.
SERVICE: Orthopedic Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Infected left total hip replacement.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Removal of infected cemented left total hip
replacement with debridement of the hip and placement of
antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers on 2/16/05 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Beish is a 46-year-old female
with multiple medical problems who initially sustained a left hip
intertrochanteric fracture in October of 2004 and underwent an
ORIF with a DHS on 10/15/04 . The screw ultimately cut off and
she underwent removal of hardware on 9/28/04 with insertion of a
hemiarthroplasty with antibiotic beads. Her culture grew
coag-negative staph at that time and she was treated with six
weeks of IV antibiotics. After multiple hip aspirations to
confirm that the joint was no longer infected , she underwent a
left total hip replacement on 8/15/04 by Dr. Sweis . She ended
up being hospitalized in Gassonvenchand Pendinea Port from 3/5/05 to 8/16/05
with an E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology , although it was
felt likely secondary to pyelonephritis. During that
hospitalization , she developed neck pain and was found to have
MRSA osteomyelitis at C6-C7. She underwent a C6-C7 I&amp;D infusion
on 5/24/05 . She ultimately completed 16 weeks of IV vancomycin
for her MRSA spinal infection and at the completion of the
vancomycin therapy in February of 2005 , was started on minocycline
with a plan for a six-month treatment. She ultimately presented
to Dr. Amoako &apos;s office on 7/13/05 with increasing left
groin/hip/lateral thigh pain over several months duration. Two
left hip aspirates in August , both grew MRSA , and as such , she
was scheduled for an explant of her left total hip replacement
with insertion of an antibiotic spacer on 2/16/05 .

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single and lives alone in Utah She quit smoking tobacco 25 years ago and does not drink
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for an obese
female , ambulates with a walker and an antalgic gait on the left.
She had mild tenderness with palpation in her mid cervical
spine. She had some mild distal left upper extremity and
proximal left lower extremity weakness. Gentle range of motion
of her left hip caused pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/9/05 for
initiation of IV antibiotic therapy at the request of the
Infectious Disease Service under the direction of Dr. Willy H Kirkey . Prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy , she had
blood cultures drawn , which ultimately showed no growth. Given
her neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of her
cervical spine performed , which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. Preoperatively , she was seen by both the
Infectious Disease Consult Service as well as the Medical Consult
Service. She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service. On the morning of
hospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt to
likely add little benefit. She did receive one dose of Coumadin
the night before surgery in preparation for DVT prophylaxis. She
was ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2
where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacement
with irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibiotic
spacer. Estimated blood loss was 2.5 L. She received six units
of packed red blood cells , 9 L of crystalloid and 1 L of albumin.
Intraoperatively , gross pus was found. Intraoperative cultures
were sent , which ultimately grew MRSA. The patient received
perioperative stress dose hydrocortisone. Postoperatively , she
was taken to the surgical intensive care unit and intubated. Her
postoperative hematocrit was 29.2. The morning of postoperative
day 1 , the patient remained intubated but was able to open her
eyes and follow commands. She was neurovascularly intact in the
left lower extremity. She was treated with Lovenox only
initially given that she did not initially have an NG tube so
that p.o. medications including Coumadin could be administered.
She was continued on the vancomycin. The patient remained
intubated throughout the remainder of postoperative day 1 and
into the morning of postoperative day 2. Her hematocrit had
drifted down to 22.4 on postoperative day #1 for which she was
transfused two units with her hematocrit up to 26.2. She
continued to remain hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly
intact. An NG tube had been placed on postoperative day 1 , so
that p.o. medications including her Mestinon could be given for
her myasthenia gravis. She was ultimately extubated mid morning
on postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that time
and the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. The
patient remained in the surgical ICU until postoperative day 3 ,
mainly with continued pain issues. She had been on a fentanyl
drip and was transitioned over to Dilaudid PCA. She was started
on clear diet on postoperative day 3 and transitioned over to
regular insulin sliding scale from the insulin drip that she had
been on to the early a.m. hours of postoperative day 3. Her
hematocrit remained stable in the high 20s. Her right IJ central
line was changed out over a wire under sterile technique in the
ICU on postoperative day 3 prior to transfer to the floor. She
was transferred to the floor in stable condition lat in the day
on postoperative day 3. She was taking p.o.&apos;s at that time and
her home medications were restarted including her home
prednisone. Postoperative day 4 , pain continued to be her main
issue and she was seen by the Chronic Pain Service for
recommendations on transitioning her off of the high-dose
Dilaudid PCA. PCA was discontinued and she was started on p.r.n.
oxycodone in addition to her home a fentanyl patch and OxyContin.
Physical Therapy worked with the patient throughout her hospital
stay and were able to first sit her up on the edge of the bed on
postoperative day 4. She continued to remain afebrile ,
hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization. Her hematocrit was stable in
the high 20s. She had a PICC line placed on postoperative day 5
for administration of her long-term IV vancomycin. The Pain
Service continued to see the patient and titrate her pain
medications with gradually improving effect. The Foley was
discontinued the morning of postoperative day 6 , as the patient
began to be able to move around a little more easily. By
postoperative day 7 , she was more comfortable , was tolerating a
regular diet and voiding q. shift without a Foley. She was
afebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. She
was continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR was
still not therapeutic. She should continue on the Coumadin with
a Lovenox bridge until the INR is therapeutic. The patient was
cleared for transfer to rehab on postoperative day 7 by the
Orthopedic Infectious Disease and Physical Therapy services. She
was accepted for transfer to the Biger Community Hospital in Ee ,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 46 year old woman
with a history of asthma , who was
admitted with an asthma exacerbation. She had asthma since
childhood , never intubated , never previously treated with steroids.
She felt upper respiratory symptoms 5 days before admission. She
had dyspnea 2 days before admission. In the emergency room , the
patient had a peak flow of 300 , oxygen saturation 92% on room air.
She was treated with steroids , Solu-Medrol and then prednisone 60
milligrams orally , beta agonist , nebulizer and ampicillin. She had
continuation of oral theophylline as she had been using as an
outpatient. Her lung examination showed wheezes bilaterally in the
emergency room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for asthma ,
degenerative joint disease , lower back pain , status post burn
injury. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Theo-Dur 200 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , prednisone 60 milligrams by mouth each day ,
Albuterol nebulizer , ampicillin 500 milligrams by mouth 3 times a
day and Bronkosol. ALLERGIES included sulfa drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese woman in no acute
distress. Temperature was 97.8 , heart rate
84 to 90 , blood pressure 110 to 132/70 to 84. Of note on the
physical examination her lungs had bilateral wheezes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , hematocrit was 41.6 , white
count 9.66 , platelets 199 , 000. SMA-7 was
within normal limits , theophylline level was subtherapeutic. Sputum
gram stain showed many gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs
with a few polys , and grew Hemophilus and a peri-influenza that was
sensitive to ciprofloxacin and Keflex , but resistant to ampicillin.
Chest x-ray was negative.

wheezing in her breath sounds , increased peak
flow from 300 , went down to 270 , back up to 300 with less dyspnea
at the time of discharge and she was given an echocardiogram to
look for a cardiac etiology of bilateral pedal edema that she was
having. The patient was discharged on 6 of July .
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE were all her usual medications , plus Keflex
500 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day , prednisone 50 milligrams by

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: CLIFTON PHILLIANS MD
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with no known CAD but multiple
cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , and diabetes , who presents to the Umman Healthcare
on the evening of 9/19/04 from her PCP office for possible
unstable angina. She was in her usual state of health until
approximately 10 days ago when she noted URI symptoms including
fevers , cough , rhinorrhea , and fatigue. Her coughing was
associated with left scapular pain; however , at this time she had
no chest pain. The patient actually denies any chest pain ,
although her PCP had a report of chest pain from her office.
Patient at baseline has excellent exercise tolerance. She works
as a security at the Woodyonkers and walks several blocks a
day without any chest pain or shortness of breath. She also
denies any PND , orthopnea , or leg swelling. There is some
question of recent weight gain of approximately 9 lbs according
to the WMC chart but otherwise patient has no other symptoms.
The patient&apos;s URI started approximately one week prior to
admission and her symptoms have resolved approximately two to
three days prior to admission. Upon presentation , she has
minimal cough but no fevers or chills. No nausea , vomiting ,
diarrhea , or constipation. No urinary or bowel changes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient&apos;s past medical history is significant diabetes ,
poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c of 12.2 in 5/19
hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; hypothyroidism; asthma;
angioedema; diabetic retinopathy; diabetic neuropathy. No known
CAD. By report , negative ETT at NAHMC greater than 10 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:
Her medications on admission are glyburide 10 mg b.i.d. ,
amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg
p.o. q.d. , KCl 20 mEq q.d. , and insulin 70/30 95 units b.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has several documented allergies including angioedema
to ACE inhibitors , angioedema to penicillin , metformin gives her
hives , simvastatin gives her myalgias , and sulfa drugs give her
renal failure.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has no documented history of tobacco use. She has
occasional alcohol and lives with a friend who is undergoing
surgery for her eyes at present.
FAMILY HISTORY:
She has a mother who had CHF in her 70s and a brother who
sustained CVA in his 70s.
ADMISSION EXAMINATION:
The patient&apos;s admission examination , she was afebrile at 97.9
with a pulse in the 80s , blood pressure 150s/90s , and O2
saturation 96% on 1.5 L. Her examination was significant for
general obesity. Her JVP was flat. Her heart was regular rate
and rhythm. She did have a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur with no
radiation. Her extremities , trace edema bilaterally.
Her admission labs were within normal limits. Her hematocrit was
36. Her creatinine was 1.2. She had a BMP that was 7 and her
enzymes have been negative during her admission. Her EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement , T wave
inversions in I , aVL , V4 through V6 with no ST changes. However ,
none of these are new. Her chest x-ray was negative. There was
some question of lingular atelectasis. She had an echocardiogram
in 2002 that showed LVH with normal systolic function and normal
valves.
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with URI symptoms for
approximately 10 days whose symptoms are resolving. Her main
complaint now is fatigue. She denies any kind of chest pain or
shortness of breath and she is low probability for any cardiac
cause of her presentation. She has been on the rule out protocal and has
had serial enzymes and EKGs which have been negative. As an
outpatient , she will receive an echocardiogram to evaluate her
murmur and she will also perform an ETT as an outpatient as well
for risk stratification.
Her medications on discharge are unchanged.

Discharge Date:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: At the time of admission , altered mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73-year-old man with a
history of prior delirious episodes as
well as a history of chronic diarrhea who , on the night before
admission , was noted to no longer recognize people at home and to
be confused about his location. On the morning of admission , the
patient had had intractable explosive diarrhea. He does have a
history of chronic diarrhea but the diarrhea on the date of
admission was significantly more severe than usual.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied any chest pain , nausea ,
vomiting , urinary tract infection , or decrease
in his p.o. intake.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for congestive heart failure
with an ejection fraction of 50% , coronary
artery disease status post five vessel coronary artery bypass graft
in October 2002 , myelodysplastic syndrome , peripheral vascular
disease , gastrointestinal bleed status post right colectomy ,
prostate cancer status post transurethral resection of the
prostate , and macular degeneration.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission included opium
tincture , aspirin , Lomotil , Lasix , Ditropan ,
Lopid , Zocor , Atapryl , and iron.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , patient was
afebrile , his heart rate was 60 , his blood
pressure was 145/68 , and he was saturating 95% on room air. His
physical examination was notable for a jugular venous pressure at 5
cm , moist mucous membranes , and soft , nontender , nondistended
abdominal examination. On rectal examination , the patient was
noted to have guaiac positive brown stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Head CT at the time of admission was
negative for any acute change , chest x-ray
was negative for any evidence of pneumonia , and the patient&apos;s EKG
was reviewed and shown to be without change from prior studies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological - The patient&apos;s mental status
improved quickly on admission. As noted above ,
his head CT was negative. It was thought that his mental status
changes were likely secondary to dehydration and were resolved at
the time of discharge.
2. Pulmonary - During resuscitation of the patient&apos;s dehydration ,
he developed an O2 requirement although chest x-ray did not show
any evidence for fluid overload or infiltrates. Occasional wheezes
were appreciated on examination and the patient&apos;s symptoms improved
significantly with occasional nebulizer treatments of Albuterol and
Atrovent. At the time of discharge , the patient was oxygenating
well.
3. Cardiovascular - There were no acute cardiac issues during this
hospitalization. Patient&apos;s losartan was held at admission given
his acute renal failure but other outpatient medications were
continued.
4. Hematology - The patient had a history of MDS and was a patient
of Dr. Boivin . At the time of admission , the patient&apos;s hematocrit
dropped 10 points but was thought to be likely due to hydration.
Since that time , the patient&apos;s hematocrit has remained stable at
35.
5. Infectious disease - At the time of admission , the patient&apos;s
blood cultures , urine cultures , and stool cultures were all
negative. Chest x-ray on January , 2003 was clear. It was felt
that the most likely etiology of his acute worsening of his
diarrhea was viral gastroenteritis. He also did receive a 7-day
course of levofloxacin and Flagyl for empiric abdominal coverage.
The patient remained afebrile since the time of his antibiotics.
6. Gastrointestinal - The patient is status post right
hemicolectomy. He has a long history of diarrhea and presented to
this admission with explosive diarrhea and guaiac positive brown
stool. At the time of admission , Kaopectate and Lomotil were
started. On July , 2003 , he was noted to have increased
distention but a KUB was negative at that time for partial
obstruction or impaction. There were concerns that the patient&apos;s
abdominal symptoms might be secondary to ischemia so an MRI was
obtained which showed proximal disease in the SMA , IMA , and celiac
but overall with good distal flow. An abdominal CT was obtained
which showed a thick small bowel and dilated gallbladder with
stranding but no evidence for ischemia. Gastrointestinal
consultation was obtained and on November , 2003 , and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed grade IV
gastritis. As a result , the patient was started on Nexium 40
b.i.d.
7. Renal - The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. The entire hospitalization , his BUN was in the
fifties with a creatinine of 2.2. His FENA was less than 0.1% and
the patient was thought to be extremely intervascularly dry. With
gentle hydration , the patient&apos;s creatinine eventually improved to
1.9 at the time of this dictation.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Included esophagogastroduodenoscopy
revealing gastritis as discussed above.
DISPOSITION: Diet includes that the patient is discharged on a
full p.o. diet. He was also instructed to supplement
his diet with high nutrition Boost shakes. Nutrition followed the
patient closely during the admission and thought that he would need
close follow-up as an outpatient for his nutrition status.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Will be dictated in an Addendum to this
Discharge Summary.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Venzor following
discharge.

Discharge Date: 1/16/2006
Date of Admission: 3/6/2006
ATTENDING: DEROCHER , SHAUN ANTONIO MD
ADDENDUM:
ADMISSION TO THE ICU: 2/8/06 .
This will be the hospital course and plan as well as the
discharge medications.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lower extremity wounds: The patient had several left lower
extremity wounds which by report had been chronic as well as a
deeper acute onset right lower extremity wound which was
ulcerated to the level of muscle. It was thought that this wound
had occurred as a result of a hematoma after incision and
drainage by Surgical Service one to two weeks prior to admission.
There was no obvious evidence of infection , however , it is
certainly possible that there is a soft tissue surrounding that
ulcer. There was some thought of whether that could be
osteomyelitis underlying the ulcer. The patient had tibial and
fibula films which at first there was some consideration of
whether there was abnormality to the bone. On further
consideration , it was felt this is most likely not the case ,
however , to evaluate more specifically a bone scan was performed.
There was no uptake in the area of that ulcer , however , there
was some mild uptake at the left Achilles tendon calcaneal
insertion and marked uptake in the T9 thoracic 9th vertebrae. A
CAT scan of the spine was performed which revealed no evidence of
infection or neoplasm but there was evidence of osteopenia and
possibly a microfracture but no evidence of real compression
fracture. The patient was seen and examined by the Vascular
Surgery Consult Service and Dr. Smallidge , her primary vascular
surgeon. Their recommendation in terms of wound dressing was
three times a day , wet-to-dry dressing changes with 4 x 8 gauze
sponges. It was recommended that the patient follow up with Dr.
Goolden in mid 9/6 .  Please call Dr. Usman &apos;s office for an
appointment. The recommendation for three times a day wet-to-dry
dressings without additional ointments or treatments. The
patient should be followed by wound care service. In addition ,
the patient has small necrotic regions on her heels. These
should be treated with Panafil. In terms of her sacral decubitus
ulcer , the patient was seen by the Plastic Surgery Service , they
debrided the wound twice , there was minimal amount of superficial
necrotic tissue which was excised. Their recommendations for
further care were to apply one-quarter strength Dakin&apos;s solution
soaked wet-to-dry dressings to be changed twice a day for 48
hours that will be for 36 hours from discharge and then this
treatment should be changed to standard wet-to-dry dressings
twice daily to that sacral decubitus ulcer. They recommend that
she be placed on an air mattress. She should have turns at least
every 2 hours. They also recommend that her weight be kept off
the sacrum and that her nutrition be optimized. She was placed
on a multivitamin , continued on calcium , started on zinc , vitamin
C supplements as well. The patient should follow up with Dr.
Roscoe Szymonik as an outpatient. This should be scheduled by
calling 390-948-8630.
2. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted with
a low-grade temperature. It was unclear whether she had a
primary infection and what the source of that infection was.
Cultures were taken from blood , urine , and sputum. All blood
cultures were negative. Urine culture grew extended spectrum
beta-lactamase resistant Klebsiella pneumonia which was
intermediate to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to levofloxacin.
Because the patient has so little urine output it was unclear
whether at first this was a colonizer or an actual infection.
Infectious disease consultation was requested. Their
recommendations were to start ciprofloxacin and then this was
changed to levofloxacin when the final susceptibilities came back
and they continued that for a two-week course. She is currently
on levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.48h. This course will finish on
9/4/06 . Sputum cultures grew multidrug resistant Pseudomonas
aeruginosa as well as a few Acinetobacter which were also
resistant to many antibiotics. After close consultation with
Infectious Disease Consultation Service it was decided that these
were most likely colonizers. There was no evidence of an acute
pneumonia or tracheobronchitis and the patient was not treated
for her colonization with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. In the
past she has had multiple other multiple drug resistant organisms
that grew from her sputum cultures at other institutions and it
was felt that unless she demonstrated evidence of clinical
pulmonary infection these should not be treated. Overall , her
hemodynamic status was stable and she was afebrile throughout her
course. Several days into her admission , however , she did have
one episode of low blood pressure initially treated with
intravenous fluids and then norepinephrine infusion for short
period of time. However , on repeat cuff pressure manually it was
revealed that her blood pressure actually was normal and that
there was dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of the
automatic cuff , therefore it was thought that this low blood
pressure was spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff that
was being used. So in conclusion the only medication on
discharge will be levofloxacin 500 mg q.48h. through 9/4/06 .
3. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease and atrial fibrillation. She was on Toprol 12.5 mg by
mouth two times a day throughout her stay. Her heart rate ranged
from 120s-130s when she was first admitted to 50s-60s on
discharge. This should be readdressed regularly in terms of her
need for rate control. At this point , she will be discharged on
that low dose of beta-blocker. Otherwise , she was admitted on
Coumadin with a INR of 2-3 for her St. Jude&apos;s aortic valve. Her
INR was therapeutic on admission. This was actually discontinued
after a couple of days in anticipation of a possible procedure.
It was restarted three days prior to discharge. She was on
heparin as a bridge for anticoagulation in the meantime. She
should be continued on the heparin with a goal PTT of 50-70 until
her INR is therapeutic at 2-3 and this should be rechecked to
make sure that her INR remains therapeutic. Her care was
discussed with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Sean Mesa .
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
Her diabetes was controlled with insulin NPH 35 units
subcutaneous every morning with a regular insulin sliding scale
every 6 hours as well. This should be continued and fingersticks
should be done every 6 hours. The patient also has a history of
hypothyroidism. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level was
checked and was found to be elevated at 14.5. Her thyroid
replacement dose was increased from 75 mcg per day to 88 mcg a
day. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level should be checked
again in four to six weeks and dose adjustment accordingly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient was continued on her mechanical
ventilation. There were attempts at lower pressure support and
even spontaneously breathing trials. She was not able to
tolerate these for a long period of time , however , it does seem
that she has improved to some degree in terms of her ventilatory
mechanics. She is currently on pressure support ventilation at
15 of pressure support and 5 of positive end expiratory pressure
with an FIO2 of 0.4. We believe that she could probably be
weaned slowly to significantly decreased pressure support and I
believe most likely she will be able at some point to be taken
off the ventilator , although this is certainly not certain. She
will be continued on her nebulizer treatments.
6. Nutrition: The patient was continued on tube feeds. She is
on full strength Nepro at 50 cc per hour. In addition , she is
getting vitamin C supplementation , ascorbic acid 500 mg by mouth
two times a day , Nephrocaps , zinc sulfate 220 mg by mouth daily
and these should be continued as indicated for her renal failure
and wound healing.
7. Psychiatric: The patient was continued on her home dose of
fluoxetine 20 mg by G tube daily and on Zyprexa 10 mg by G tube
at bedtime.
8. Prophylaxis: Throughout her stay , the patient was continued
on her home esomeprazole 40 mg by G tube twice a day and for deep
venous thrombosis prophylaxis , her INR on Coumadin remained above
1.4 and her PTT was kept therapeutic on intravenous heparin.
Intravenous heparin should be continued with PTT checks on
admission and then every 6 hours unit they were fairly stable
between 50 and 70 and that should be monitored at least daily
until her INR is stably therapeutic. It will be very important
to monitor her INR carefully while she is on levofloxacin as
well.
9. Access: The patient has a left-sided midline which was
placed in mid 8/6 .  This should be removed within the next
one week and another line placed as preferred by the
rehabilitation physician. In addition , the patient&apos;s dialysis
catheter while functional does seem to have eroded through the
skin below her clavicle. The hemodialysis service should be
aware and consider replacement as indicated. At this point there
is no indication of infection of either of those lines , however ,
she is at high risk of infection of both.
10. Renal: The patient was continued on her hemodialysis as per
the Renal Service. Please feel free to contact Dr. Napoleon R Lafevre , the patient&apos;s ICU physician here at Ciledall Hospital with any questions you may have. As noted in the
dictation , the patient should follow up within the next three to
four weeks with Dr. Mcniel of Vascular Surgery and also with the
Plastic Surgery Service.

1. Vitamin C 500 mg by G tube two times a day.
2. Peridex mouthwash 15 mL twice a day.

Discharge Date: 10/1/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55 year old male
with a history of asthma , chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant psychiatric history
including mania , depression and psychosis.
His cardiac risk factors include hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use ,
family history. He does not have diabetes mellitus , although he
has had chemical diabetes mellitus in the past while on steroids.
He has been hypertensive.
He is transferred from Ler Dition Hospital with questionable
chest pain during the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
bronchitis flare. In 10 of January he had an asthma flare. He had a
respiratory arrest with intubation. Catheterization at that time
showed a 40% LAD lesion. His wedge pressure was 20 mmHg. He had
normal LV function on LV gram at that time. In 11 of March he had a
nonQ-wave myocardial infarction with CKs approximately 300. In
2 of July he had another nonQ-wave myocardial infarction. CK is
approximately 700. In 7 of March he had an exercise tolerance test in
which he went nine minutes. He had 1 mm ST depression in 2 , 3 and
F. He reached maximum heart rate of 137 , blood pressure 186/80.
Since that time he has had multiple , multiple admissions for asthma
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares and rule out for
myocardial infarction; each time ruling out. In 28 of May he was in the
emergency room with vasovagal episode , treated with atropine. In
12 of November he had an exercise tolerance test with thallium of which he
underwent four minutes. He had a blood pressure of 164/80. He did
not have any chest pain , ectopy or evidence of ischemia on EKG ,
although there was questionable old infarct or ischemia at the apex
on the thallium images. In 9 of February he had a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare. He went to Sampf. And Memorial Hospital .  He had a
chest pain. He refused cardiac catheterization at that time and
was felt to be not competent to do such. Then his mental status
improved and he was deemed competent. He continued to refuse
cardiac catheterization. In 10 of September he was transferred from
Sidegreen Louw. Hospital to Elkhays Healthcare after difficulty
breathing and coughing up green-brown sputum for a couple of days.
He had chest pressure radiating to his left arm and his jaw and
this lasted for hours. He ruled out at Rock Community Hospital for
myocardial infarction. He had 0.5 mm ST depressions in V4 through
V6. He was treated there for unstable angina with nitropaste ,
aspirin , heparin and transferred to Dely Hospital on
aminophylline and heparin IV drips.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Vital signs - 98.1 temperature ,
84 heart rate , 146/82 blood pressure , room
air sat was 98%. He was slightly labored breathing on admission ,
but was not in respiratory distress. His jugular venous pulsations
were visible approximately 3 cm above the angle. He had decreased
breath sounds bilaterally and moderate , diffuse wheezing
throughout. Heart - Sounds were very distant across the precordium
although audible at the epigastrium , S1 and S2 were normal. There
was no murmurs , gallops or rubs. He did not have any rashes. His
mental status was intact although he had increased rate of speech
and rapid thoughts.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission - 141 sodium , 4.1 potassium , 100
chloride , 27 bicarb , 118 glucose , 26/1.2 ,
BUN/creatinine. WBC 10.39 , hematocrit 44.1 , platelet count 190.
CK was 100. troponin 0.7 , calcium was 9.5 , magnesium 2.2 , valproic
acid 42 level.
EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per
minute. He had a normal axis. His R-wave progression was normal.
Intervals are 0.128 , 0.96 , 0.394. He had inverted Ts in 1 and L
and nonspecific T-wave changes throughout with some 0.5 mm ST
depressions at baseline in his inferior leads.
Chest x-ray was normal.
He was admitted and declined catheterization initially , asking about an
exercise test first. He had his sputum gram stain
which showed gram positive cocci and gram positive rods. He was started on IV
cefuroxime. His heparin and aminophylline were discontinued on
admission. He was treated mainly for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare. He had a history of steroid induced psychosis. He
was treated with inhaled steroids and Albuterol and Azmacort via
nebulization. He improved his peak flows on admission which were
approximately 250; discharge peak flows were between 500 and 700.
He underwent an exercise echocardiogram on 11 of August which showed one
mm ST depression on top of the half mm baseline ST depressions of
the inferior leads , potentially consistent with ischemia although
when the echo images were reviewed they were not thought to be
consistent with ischemia. There was no change in wall motion
during exercise as compared to rest.

HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50-year-old man who was admitted to
Arlricks Community Hospital on March , 2005 , with respiratory failure
and fever diagnosed with pneumonia and COPD flare. He was
started empirically on antibiotics. Sputum culture was positive
for Pseudomonas and treated with ceftazidime and levofloxacin.
Also , noted at Ieldha Hospital to have 4/4 blood cultures
positive for coagulation-negative Staphylococcus. He was placed
on vancomycin. During the course of this hospital stay , he had
other medical issues including: Non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction. Also noted to have upper gastrointestinal bleed due
to supratherapeutic INR. Also had acute on chronic renal failure
with a creatinine of 7.7 , thought to be due to IV contrast. He
was transferred to O Medical Center ICU after going into
respiratory distress at Sti Versut Center , for which he was intubated.
He was continued on antibiotics at Onnau Hospital .  In
the shore health center surgical ICU at the Quinla , he was also noted to have
an improvement in his acute renal failure with his creatinine
improving to 2.0 range. With IV fluids , his non-ST elevation MI
appeared to be resolving; however , was noted to have ongoing
fevers despite antibiotics. Noted on abdominal CT to have free
air. He was taken to the operating room on June , 2005 ,
and had sigmoid colectomy with colostomy and he remained
intubated postoperatively , and was transferred to Ins Surgical
ICU. Postoperatively , he was continued on broad-spectrum
antibiotics including vancomycin , ceftazidime , and was continued
on fluconazole for fungemia. Intraoperatively , he was noted to
have perforation in his sigmoid colon. He in the ICU , required
Levophed and vasopressin. The patient was noted to have ongoing
respiratory failure. He required reintubation on October ,
2005 , after a brief period of extubation. He returned to the
operating room on October , 2005 , where he had an ileostomy ,
T-tube placement , and a tracheostomy. In addition , his abdomen
was explored and adhesions were lysed. Postoperatively , he was
noted to have further improvement of his renal failure. He was
noted to have improvement in acidosis; however , had ongoing slow
wean off the ventilator. He was noted to have on followup CT to
have intraabdominal fluid collections along with his daily
fevers. On January , 2005 , he had a CT-guided drainage and
placement of a drain for one of these fluid collections. He had
some ongoing improvement and was continued on vancomycin , Flagyl ,
fluconazole , and ceftazidime post procedurally. Repeat cultures
of sputum yielded ongoing Pseudomonas in the sputum sensitive to
ceftazidime. Also noted to have Aspergillus in his sputum.
Thought to have possible colonization of his airways. On
followup CT , he was noted to have ongoing fluid collection as
well as daily fevers. He was discontinued on his central lines
and had a change-out of his arterial line. He also obtained a
tagged white blood cell scan , which revealed an area of
enhancement in his right lower quadrant consistent with possible
abscess; however , this patient had decreasing frequency of fevers
with discontinuation of lines and continuation of antibiotics. Moreover , the
area of enhancement on the tagged cell scan did not correlate with a
significant fluid collection on abdominal CT. After consultation with the
Infectious
Disease Service , Interventional Radiology Service , and the Surgical Service , it
was decided that there would be no intervention done on this
collection at this time. Otherwise , the patient now is starting
PO and is having ongoing low-grade temperatures , but clinically
improving. From the respiratory standpoint , was liberated from mechanical
prior to discharge from the ICU.
LABORATORY DATA: White cell count 16 , 000 , hematocrit 27 ,
platelets 443. Chem 7: Sodium 134 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 95 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 36 , creatinine 1.7 , calcium 9.1. PT 14.9 ,
INR 1.2 , PTT 34.1.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 50-year-old man with history of
coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic renal insufficiency , who
is status post colectomy with ileostomy secondary to perforated
sigmoid colon , status post tracheostomy for respiratory failure ,
prolonged ICU course secondary to pneumonia , sepsis , acute on
chronic renal failure , and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Neurological: The patient is now off sedative drips. He is
alert and oriented and has chronic pain secondary to degenerative
lower back disease; however , his pain has been well controlled
with his current regimen. Psychiatric consult was obtained and
he is noted to have an adjustment disorder with anxiety.
Plan is to continue oxycodone as needed and continue Ativan as
needed.
Cardiovascular: Status post non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30% , has had no further signs of pulmonary edema by x-ray or by
clinical symptoms. He is off pressors. He has been
hemodynamically stable and in normal sinus rhythm.
Plan is to continue amiodarone via T tube and continue digoxin.
We will diurese with Lasix as needed to keep I&apos;s and O&apos;s even.
Respiratory: Continues to be slow steroid wean. Liberated from mechanical
ventilation prior to transfer out of the ICU. S/p tracheostomy , history
chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease , completing course of Pseudomonas pneumonia
treatments on ceftazidime.
Gastrointestinal: Continues to be on tube feeds , goal rate. We
will start advancing PO diet as tolerated with a plan to wean
tube feeds as the patient is able to tolerate further PO&apos;s. We
will plan to start PO medications as tolerated.
FEN/GU: Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.5
to 1.7. Acute renal failure , resolved. He has been having good
urine output with no major electrolyte abnormalities. We will
continue to diurese with Lasix as needed to keep I&apos;s and O&apos;s
even.
Endocrine: This patient remains on insulin sliding scale. We
will titrate to keep euglycemic.
Heme: The patient has been anemic with hematocrits in the mid
20s and has been stable , likely due to nutrition and anemia of
chronic disease. We will continue to watch hematocrit on the
floor and continue DVT prophylaxis.
ID: Currently on day #19 of ceftazidime of 21. The patient has
been doing well off vancomycin , fluconazole , and Flagyl. He has
been having low-grade temperatures , but improved from the last
several weeks. We will continue to monitor JP output as well as
to follow clinically. He is noted to have an ongoing fluid
collection in his abdomen and may warrant a followup CT at some
point in the future. Transferred to floor with cardiac
monitoring.
DISPOSITION: This patient&apos;s condition is stable.

since last cath 99
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 yo with CAD s/p PTCA with stent to 1st diag in 1999 , also with
chronic lower back pain with intrathecal morphine pump. Presents with
chest pain in context of 12 hours nausea/vomiting/dry heave likely
secondary to morphine withdrawal from malfunctioning pump. Chest pain
relieved with SL NTG x3. Enzyme leak , troponin 1.3 at outside hospital
--&gt; NQWMI. Pt transferred for cath to evaluate stent. Cath 5/10/01
showed patent D1 stent , 50% LAD , 60% PDA with likely accelerated
idioventricular rhythm post cath. He was transferred to cards
for evaluation of rhythm and optimization of cardiac management.
Pt has been asymptomatic on morphine PCA ( pending arrival of
intrathecal pump infusion per pain service ). HTN was controlled with
clonidine , and his ECG normalized. Chest pain was thought
to be secondary to increased demand during acute withdrawal. Will
Pump was refilled per pain service , and his cardiac regimen was
optimized. Outpatient cardiology follow up with stress test to risk
stratify was arranged. Patient&apos;s urine output was marginal on 3/16/01 .
He was hydrated with modest response. BUN and creatinine were stable.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Call your doctor or go to emergency room if you develop chest pain ,
lightheadedness , worsening shortness of breath , or palpitations. Follow
-up appointments have ben scheduled for cardiology , cholesterol
management , and primary care.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: THis is a 71 year old male with
diabetes mellitus , asthma , history of
guaiac positive stool , history of angina now with increased
weakness and shortness of breath progressive over one month. He
has required increased metered dose inhalers for &quot;asthma&quot; over the
past two weeks and has become progressively short of breath over
one block where he used to be able to walk &quot;all the way into town.&quot;
He denied dizziness , myalgias , no fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting
or diarrhea but did complain of a decreased appetite and ten pound
weight loss over the past month. He said he has had black stools

and Zantac 150 b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive tobacco pack per day , ETOH occasionally
and he lives with his wife. He doesn&apos;t work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile at
97.8 with heart rate of 80 , blood pressure
110/50 , lying down and sitting up heart rate of 88 and blood
pressure of 120/50. He was satting 97% on room air. GENERAL: He
was awake , alert , Spanish speaking male , poor historian. HEENT:
NC/AT , EOMI , PERRLA. OROPHARYNX: Negative with moist mucous
membranes. NECK: He had no JVP. CORONARY: Regular rate , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. LUNGS; Crackles bilaterally at bases.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , tympanic with good bowel sounds and no
peritoneal signs. RECTAL: Showed guaiac positive brown stool.
EXTREMITIES: Warm , dry but poorly palpable peripheral pulses.
Cranial nerves examination showed II/XII grossly intact and motor
and sensory exams were without gross deficit.
LABORATORY: His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with first degree
AV block , rate of 78 , PR of 212 , QRS of 96 and QT 448
with axis of 57. He had some flat Ts in AVL and T wave inversion
in V1. His chest x-ray had no infiltrate , no effusion and no
evidence of failure. Laboratory revealed sodium of 138 , potassium
of 4.1 , chloride 103 and bicarbonate of 25 with BUN of 17 and
creatinine 1.2. His baseline was 0.7 in 4/10 .  Glucose was 186 and
anion gap of 10. He had a white count of 8.2 , hematocrit of 17.9
which his baseline was 39.5 in 4/10 , platelets of 280 and MCV of
68. He had 66 neutrophils , 21 lymphs and 8 monos and PT of 12.1 ,
PTT of 21.3 and INR of 1.0. His CK was 47 and Troponin was 21.9.
His amylase was 28 and lipase was 187.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problem list: Heme: He had a hematocrit of
17.9 down from baseline of 39.5. He was
transfused three packed red blood cells and his hematocrit
responded appropriately. It was 34.5 by the day of discharge. He
also had iron studies sent off that showed a total iron binding
capacity of 324 and ferritin of 20 consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. He was restarted on Niferex.
GI: Given this guaiac positive stool and history of guaiac
positive stool in 1999 , he was thought to have an acute on chronic
GI bleed questionably secondary to diverticulosis or cancer. He
also has history of gastritis. We kept him NPO. GI consult was
obtained. He underwent initially an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
which was completely normal. Esophagus had no varices , no
esophagitis. Stomach was normal; no ulcer , no erosion or end NSAID
gastropathy. His duodenum to D3 was normal with small
periampullary diverticulum. Colonoscopy was then performed which
found sigmoid diverticulosis , 4 millimeter non-bleeding sessile
polyp which was removed by snare cautery and some mild oozing after
the polypectomy but good hemostasis was achieved. Small , internal
hemorrhoids were present but no active bleeding sites were found.
On pathology , it was found to be a hyperplastic polyp. GI team
recommended small bowel follow through to rule out small bowel
source for bleeding as an outpatient. The patient was kept on his
Zantac 150 b.i.d. for history of gastritis. The patient was sent
home on Tylenol for pain and told to avoid taking aspirin or any
other NSAIDs given his GI bleed.
Renal: Creatinine was 1.2 on admission. His baseline was 0.9. He
received some IV fluids as he was NPO for his GI studies and his
creatinine came down to 0.9. So , it was likely that he was
slightly volume depleted on admission.
Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of angina but no recent
chest pain and no cardiac complaints. With his hematocrit of 18 ,
he had a flat CK and Troponin of 0.19 and had no further cardiac
issues during this hospital course. He was kept off aspirin given
his GI bleeding. THe patient also has hypertension and was on
Isordil and Cardizem for that. His blood pressure meds were held
initially on admission and were re-added back at the time of
discharge as well as his Mevacor.
Endocrine: The patient was maintained on his Humulin NPH and
covered with sliding scale during this admission. His blood sugars
remained in the 160 to 180 range.
Pulmonary: The patient was kept on his Albuterol and Azmacort
metered dose inhalers and by the time of discharge , was without
wheezes and satting well at 96% on room air.
Neuro: The patient was kept on his Klonopin and Paxil for anxiety.
Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was started on
magnesium oxide for low magnesium during his hospital course.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Are as follows: 1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4
p.r.n. headache , 2. Isordil 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , 3. Cardizem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , 4. Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q day ,

Discharge Date: 8/12/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: LEFT LEG WOUND INFECTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Ploss is a 67-year-old female
with a history of diabetes , who
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft on 26 of October for unstable
angina with non-Q wave myocardial infection. She did well
postoperatively and was discharged home in good condition. About
two weeks after her operation , she began to notice some swelling
and erythema around her left thigh saphenous vein graft harvest
site. This increased and she came to the Emergency Room on
17 of March .  She denied any fever , chills , night sweats , nausea , or
vomiting. She stated there was a small amount of purulent
appearing liquid draining from the wound.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for noninsulin dependent
diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease ,
hypercholesterolemia , supraventricular tachycardia , hiatal hernia ,
osteoarthritis , chronic right ear abscess , and schizophrenia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery bypass
grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery , and saphenous vein grafts to the
posterior descending artery and the obtuse marginal artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.4 , with her other vital
signs stable. Her heart rate was regular
with a regular rhythm and no murmur. Her heart rate was 98 , and
her blood pressure was 104/58. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation , and her sternum was stable. Her left thigh was
erythematous around the wound , with a large area of induration.
She had good distal pulses , and her left foot was warm. The thigh
wound had an area of necrotic appearing skin.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The staples were removed in this area ,
and a large amount of pus was extracted.
Some of this was sent for culture. The areas of necrotic skin were
debrided and after copious irrigation , the wound was packed with
sterile gauze soaked in normal saline. She was started on
Vancomycin and gentamicin intravenously , and was admitted to the
hospital for IV antibiotics and dressing changes. Her cultures
grew out staph aureus which was methacillin resistant , but
sensative to gentamicin and vancomycin , as well as citrobacter ,
which was sensative to gentamicin and vancomycin.
She remained hemodynamically stable , and her white count came down
from 14 to a stable level of 7-8. Her temperature on the second
day after admission was 99.6 , and never rose higher than that. The
erythema in the area of her wound decreased markedly , and she
remained pain free. The wound began to granulate very well , and
the lower portion of the wound remained clean and dry , while the
upper portion required three different debridements over her
hospital course. After this , however , the entire wound remained
clean and well granulated.
The dressing changes were continued and the patient was screened
for the Rehabilitation Service to follow up with some strengthening
and IV antibiotics and dressing changes. A follow-up culture was
obtained after one of the dressing changes , which grew out e. coli ,
which was sensative to Cipro , ofloxacin , citrobacter , and
enterococci. All species have been sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
The patient was changed from vancomyin and gentamicin to vancomyin
IV and ciprofloxacin p.o. She will receive a total of 14 days of
vancomycin , and seven days of ciprofloxacin , after seven days of
gentamicin.
She was accepted for rehabilitation by Woodwa Herscotl Kuaen Region Medical Center , and on 25 of September , she was discharged to Wellma Sgriff Hospital in good condition. She will continue on an
1800 calorie ADA diet , and her discharge medications include
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol 100 mg q. day , Librium 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Cipro 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. x3 days , vancomycin 1000 mg
IV q. 24 hours x3 days , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , iron sulfate 300
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Prolixin LA 12.5 mg
intramuscularly q. two weeks. She should have dressing changes
with wet to dry normal saline gauze to her left thigh wound three
times each day , as well as wound inspections to make sure that it
continues healing as well as it is now. She will follow-up with
Dr. Danser and with her own cardiologist.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY CLAUDICATION
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: RIGHT FEMORAL POPLITEAL BYPASS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 54-year-old woman
with a history of hypertension ,
coronary artery disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
adult onset diabetes , who now presents for right lower extremity
revascularization. The patient was admitted to Strakua Memorial Hospital with severe chest pain on 1/5/92 . At that time , the
patient emergently underwent a coronary artery bypass graft after
dissection of her right coronary artery during angioplasty. She
had a coronary artery bypass graft times three ( LIMA to the LAD ,
saphenous vein graft to RCA times two ). Postoperatively , she had
an intra-aortic balloon pump placed. Immediately postoperatively ,
the patient lost pulses in her right lower extremity. She
underwent an emergent fem-fem bypass graft with return of her
pulses. The patient&apos;s postoperative course was uneventful.
Since that time , the patient has had persistent lower extremity
claudication symptoms in her right lower extremity. She underwent
angioplasty of her right SFA on 4/10 with resolution of the
angiographically evident stenosis , however , she has had persistent
symptoms. The patient now presents with right lower extremity
claudication after 10 feet. She denies any chest pain or rest
pain. She denies any shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for hypertension. 2.
Coronary artery disease. 3. Peptic ulcer
disease. 4. Adult onset diabetes. 5. Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient is status
post coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 , status post
fem-fem bypass graft in 1992 , status post angioplasty in 4/10 .

The patient has a reaction to Amoxicillin. SOCIAL HISTORY:
Cigarettes one pack a day times 35 years and the patient is still
smoking.
LABORATORY STUDIES: Electrolytes were within normal limits. BUN
of 9 and creatinine of .9. LFTs were within
normal limits. White count of 8 , hematocrit of 50. PT and PTT
were within normal limits. Chest x-ray showed no acute disease.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute disease. Noninvasive
vasculars showed no DP on the right , PT of .56for an ABI. DP on
the left was .8 and PT was .9.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a pleasant woman in no
apparent distress. Head/neck examination
were unremarkable. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Cardiac
examination was unremarkable. Abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender
and non-distended and bowel sounds were positive. There was a
palpable fem-fem graft with a positive thrill. Extremities showed
left groin site without hematoma , 2+ femoral pulses with 2+ left
sided DP and PT pulses , 1+ DP palpable. The PT was dopplerable on
monophasic.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted after angio which she
tolerated without difficulty. There was no
hematoma on her left groin. The patient was seen by Cardiology who
cleared for the revascularization recommending monitored bed and
serial EKGs and CPKs postoperatively. The patient was taken to the
Operating Room on 3/7/94 for right lower extremity
revascularization. At that time , the patient underwent a right
fem-pop bypass graft without complication. There were no
complications. For details of the operation , please see the
dictated Operative Note.
The patient&apos;s postoperative course was unremarkable. She was
afebrile and vital signs were within normal limits. The patient
had a dopplerable pulse on postoperative day #1 and for the
remainder of her hospital course. The patient&apos;s wound from her
groin had persistent serous drainage for which the patient had
t.i.d. dressing changes while in the hospital. She will be
discharged to home with VNA for b.i.d. dressing changes because of
the serous drainage has been persistent. In the upper aspect of
the patient&apos;s wound , there was some erythema for which she was
maintained on I.V. antibiotics during her hospital stay and will be
discharged on po antibiotics. There was no active purulent
drainage from any of the wound sites. The patient was ambulating
without difficulty. She was tolerating a regular diet and
urinating and having normal bowel movements. The staples were left
intact at the time of discharge because of the patient&apos;s diabetes.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home on 2/9/94
with VNA for b.i.d. dressing changes. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Keflex 500 mg q.i.d. times five days days , Percocet 1
to 2 tablets q 3 to 4 h prn pain. The patient is to resume taking
all her previous medications as normally scheduled. FOLLOW-UP
CARE: The patient is to follow up with Dr. Swigart in 1 to 2
weeks for evaluation.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Elter is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking female with history
of CAD , distant three-vessel CABG , CRI , NSTEMI in 10/29 ,
treated with just medications , EF of 75% in 10/29 , who
presented one week of PND , dyspnea on exertion , and chest
heaviness. This chest sensation did not radiate and was
unassociated with nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis or
lightheadedness. The patient also had cough with green sputum x1
year , no fevers or chills , no sick contacts. EMS gave Lasix and
Nitrospray. In the ED , she was briefly on a nonrebreather mask ,
responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix , K was 5.8 and got Kayexalate.
She became comfortable , sitting at 75 degrees , chest pain-free.
Also , noted no change in bowel/bladder habits , no change in meds
and no dietary changes. She had positive progressive lower
extremity edema x2 weeks.
ALLERGIES:
Lisinopril leading to hyperkalemia.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Retired textile worker from Ral , lives with daughter , and is
Spanish speaking.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin , metoprolol , allopurinol , valsartan , glipizide , Lipitor ,
and nifedipine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Temperature was 96 , pulse was 70 , blood pressure was 148/56 ,
respiratory rate was 20 , and saturating 100% on nonrebreather and
eventually in the high 90s on a couple of liters of oxygen. In
general , she was in no acute distress , JVP 12 cm with positive
hepatojugular reflux , soft bibasilar rales , regular rate and
rhythm , 2-3/6 systolic murmur , loudest at the left upper sternal
border , ( mild AS on echo from 1/26 ). Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended , bowel sounds positive. Extremities
showed 3+ bilateral pitting ankle edema with weak distal pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:
Showed a sodium of 129 , potassium of 5.7 , creatinine of 2.8 with
a baseline anywhere between 2 and 3.5 , cardiac enzymes negative
x1 , BNP of 1448. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 , septal
Qs , QTC of 456. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small bilateral
effusions , no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Rule out MI by enzymes and EKG
with a full set negative. Continued her aspirin , beta-blockers ,
and statin for coronary artery disease. Pump: CHF flare with
elevated BNP , volume overload , diuresed with Lasix and Diuril;
salt/water restricted , kept strict I/O with moderate diuresis.
After load reduced with ARB , weaned off her previous home calcium
channel blocker. Rhythm: Telemetry showing transient new atrial
fibrillation with a maximum heart rate of less than 70 , which
spontaneously resolved after several hours. An echo showed
stable aortic stenosis without any acute worsening. She also had
a rhythm strip on the telemetry showing a regular focus of
ventricular ectopy , also spontaneously resolving. This was
treated with continued beta-blockers. At the time of discharge ,
she was in normal sinus rhythm.
2. Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine
of 2.8 to 3.3 , with acute worsening in-house , most likely
secondary to over diuresis with Diuril/Lasix , also some prerenal
component secondary to fluid restriction. Her potassium was
elevated initially , got Kayexalate , and then was low/low normal
after Lasix. Creatinine peaked at 4.1 , Lasix and ARBs were held.
Urine study showed a prerenal component , also showed some
proteinuria. Her creatinine eventually improved to 3.3 , and her
bicarb improved from 17 to 23 with the closing of her acid gap
from 17 to 11. Potassium was 4.5 at the time of discharge. The
patient will need to follow up with Dr. Dasgupta , her
nephrologist , and she was set up for an appointment on 2/18/04 .
3. Endocrine: DM-2 , she was treated with regular sliding scale
insulin with good blood sugar control. Her glipizide was held
given that her creatinine clearance was worsening. We did not
restart her glipizide at the time of discharge until follow up
with Dr. Ohlenbusch given her overall worsening creatinine
clearance.
4. Rheumatology: History of gout , change her allopurinol to
q.72h. from q.o.d. secondary to creatinine clearance. She did
complain of some left heel pain and left foot pain , thought
secondary to her gout. This improved at the time of discharge.
5. Heme: Hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25 , her guaiac was
negative on the 2/5/04 . She also has epistaxis at night for
four to five days. She was placed on humidified room air given
nasal saline sprays and Afrin. Because of her coronary artery
disease , she was transfused total of 3 units over the course of
her hospital stay to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. She
was given Lasix after her transfusions. An ENT evaluation showed
a small area of ulceration in her posterior nasopharynx , which
will need a follow up possibly with a CT as an outpatient to rule
out malignancy. At the time of her discharge , her hematocrit was
36. Initially , Coumadin was started given her new onset of
atrial fibrillation. After consideration of risks versus benefit
of anticoagulation , her transient atrial fibrillation which
resolved spontaneously , it was decided to continue any further
anticoagulation and send her out just on aspirin. She did
receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while in-house.
GI: The patient initially had some constipation , which was
relieved with stool softeners. The patient&apos;s stool was guaiac
negative. The patient received the PPI.
DISPOSITION:
The daughter who is the patient&apos;s healthcare proxy was made aware
of the patient&apos;s status and disposition throughout her hospital
course. A PT evaluation indicated that the patient would benefit
from a period of re-stay at rehab , however the patient family
preferred the patient to go home and was constant that they would
be able to provide 24/7 support over the next week as the patient
will need help in navigating her home which included two flights
of stairs. PT was comfortable with this and this was explained
thoroughly to the patient and her family with regard to the risks
versus benefit of going home versus going to rehab. The patient
will follow up with Dr. Heingartner in one to two weeks , which has
not been scheduled , and with Dr. Tsunoda with Nephrology which
has been scheduled for 2/18/04 . Communication was made with Dr.
Smyth regarding her admission here. The patient will be sent
home with VNA support to follow up on her weights and fluid
status , she will also have home physical therapy.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND BRIEF SUMMARY: This is a 27-year-old
female with a history of craniopharyngioma , status post resection
and XRT in 1993 with subsequent panhypopituitarism and chronic
sleepiness. She was admitted to the General Medical Service on
1/1/05 with a two-week history of a.m. confusion , visual changes ,
ataxia , tinnitus , bilateral lower extremity edema , and shortness
of breath. She had also had easy bruising and a severe episode
of epistaxis requiring cauterization. Her blood work was notable
for pancytopenia. She then had swelling of her hands and arms as
well as a rash. MRI in 2/17 showed no change or evidence of
tumor recurrence. The patient , while on the General Medical
Service , had an extensive rheumatologic , neurologic , and
hematologic workup , at which point she underwent both bone marrow
biopsy and unsuccessful LP under IV conscious sedation. The
patient became unresponsive and hypothermic about 2 hours after
her bone marrow biopsy and was therefore transferred to the MICU
on 10/6/05 for closer observation. She seemed encephalopathic
during this stay and was started empirically on ampicillin ,
cefoxitin , and acyclovir. She was then sent for a CT-guided
lumbar puncture requiring intubation. She was extubated on
4/18/05 . She was then transferred out to the floor where she
continued to improve. Hospital course in more detail by system
below.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses
CPAP at home. Her outpatient pulmonologist at the Ceanmin Chbre Memorial
was contacted who confirmed this. On admission , she had a normal
O2 saturation with a relatively clear chest x-ray. However , she
became hypothermic and unresponsive following her bone marrow
biopsy. She also required intubation for CT-guided lumbar
puncture for airway protection in the setting of her excessive
sedation. She was extubated on 4/18/05 and her oxygen was
quickly weaned off. Since then she has been oxygenating and
ventilating well on room air. CPAP was continued at night. She
has had no other pulmonary complications.
2. CVS. The patient has no history of cardiac disease. An
echocardiogram done on 6/1/05 showed normal LV function with
preserved ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities ,
moderate tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral regurgitation.
In terms of her rhythm , the patient has a resting bradycardia in
the 30s to 40s that is thought to be secondary to increased vagal
tone and has no hemodynamic consequence. She received atropine
while in the ICU at 1 mg x 1 on two separate occasions; in the
first instance for bradycardia to a heart rate of 19 in the
setting of getting vasoconstrictors for a low blood pressure and
the second time when she had a heart rate down to 30. After the
patient was transferred out to the floor , we did obtain a
dedicated EP Service Cardiology consult , who evaluated the
patient. They confirmed that her bradycardia is most likely due
to vagal tone. She responds appropriately with an increase in
her heart rate with exertion. In this young woman , it was deemed
that a pacemaker would not be an appropriate choice. She did
have 3-4 second pauses on one occasion on the floor but had no
recurrence throughout the rest of her stay. If after discharge
she develops further pauses or a syncopal episode , this issue can
be revisited. While she was in house , we did keep atropine and
Zoll pads at the bedside but did not have to use it once she was
transferred out of the ICU. In terms of ischemia , the patient
had a slightly elevated CK-MB on admission , but she has had a
normal echocardiogram and negative troponin since.
3. Renal. The patient developed acute renal failure during the
early part of her stay thought secondary to acyclovir , which had
been given for presumptive meningitis. Her abdominal ultrasound
was negative and urine eosinophils were also negative. Her
creatinine improved with appropriate hydration and was normal at
the time of discharge ( creatinine equal to 1.0 ).
4. The patient does have a history of hypernatremia. Initially ,
her home DDAVP was held for fear that it would be difficult to
diurese her if she became volume overloaded given her somewhat
elevated creatinine. However , her sodium continued to increase
to 155 despite getting free water repletion , so her DDAVP was
restarted on 10/5/05 . She was discharged on her home dose of
DDAVP of 0.2 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 0.4 mg p.o. q.p.m. with one nasal
spray q.h.s. Her sodium at the time of discharge was 145. She
has been followed by the Endocrine Service in house for this.
They have recommended that she not increase her home dose ,
instead she will aggressively increase her p.o. water intake in
order to maintain her normal sodium. She will follow up in two
weeks with Dr. Kearley of Endocrine who will recheck her
electrolytes at that time.
5. Derm/Rheumatology. The patient was evaluated by both of
these services during her stay. She had biopsies done of several
locations that showed nonspecific pathology consistent with mixed
connective tissue disease. However , her serologies have , for the
most part , been negative. She was treated presumptively with
stress-dose and eventually pulse steroids. These were tapered
towards her stay. She will be discharged on a quick taper of
hydrocortisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two days , after which she
will revert to her home dose of 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o.
q.p.m.
6. Endocrine. The patient has panhypopituitarism and was
followed by the Endocrine Service throughout her stay. In terms
of her thyroid function , the patient was continued on her home
dose of Levoxyl. It was difficult to interpret her TSH in the
setting of panhypopituitarism; therefore we followed her T4 , T3 ,
and free T4 levels. These were rechecked towards the end of her
stay once she had recovered from her acute illness and in light
of a slightly decreased free T4 level , her Levoxyl was increased
to 275 mcg p.o. daily at the time of discharge.
7. Diabetes insipidus. The patient&apos;s hypernatremia was
corrected with D5 water and increasing her p.o. fluid intake.
She was also put back on her home dose of DDAVP.
8. Growth hormone. There was no indication for growth hormone
replacement.
9. Adrenal insufficiency. The patient completed a course of
stress dose steroids for her procedures and then got pulse
steroids per wound for a question of lupus versus mixed
connective tissue disorder. However , this was tapered over her
stay and she will be discharged on a very brief taper. She will
go back to her home regimen of hydrocortisone.
10. Gonadotropins. The patient was continued on Aviane ( OCP )
during her stay.
11. Neurologic. The patient had no clear etiology for her
hypersomnolence. She was followed by the Neurologic Service in
house. She does not appear to be hypercarbic or hypoxic. Her
infectious workup was entirely negative and she was therefore
taken off antibiotics. Her EEG showed nonspecific diffuse
slowing with no seizure foci. The default diagnosis has been
that some of her symptoms , including her altered mental status ,
lower extremity edema , rash , and perhaps even pancytopenia , may
be secondary to Provigil. This was therefore discontinued and
she should not start this once she returns home. Initially , her
stimulants were held for fear that they were contributing to her
pancytopenia. However , her Ritalin was restarted once her counts
started to recover. She was discharged on Ritalin-SR 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Her mental status seemed to improve on this regimen. At
the time of discharge , she was awake , alert , able to converse
well , and at her baseline.
12. Hematologic. The patient presented with pancytopenia , again
of unclear etiology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for
leukemia , lymphoma , and myelodysplasia. Rather , it was
consistent with a viral effect or drug effect. Her counts had
resolved by the time of discharge with a white blood count equal
to 9.26 , hematocrit of 27.6 , and platelets of 266. This too may
have been due to Provigil effect.
13. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Pepcid for GI
prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
14. Code. Full.
15. ID. The patient had multiple blood , urine cultures , and CSF
cultures sent. These were all negative. Of note , stool culture
was positive for C. difficile. She was therefore started on p.o.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. on 9/20/05 . She will complete a 14-day
course of this antibiotic.
DISPOSITION: Home with VNA services.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Satisfactory.
COMPLICATIONS DURING THIS HOSPITAL STAY: None.
TO DO/FOLLOWUP PLAN:
1. The patient should follow up with her PCP in 1-2 weeks.
2. The patient should follow up with Dr. Bodenstein in the Endocrine
Department in 2-4 weeks. She can be reached at 842-444-3923.
3. The patient should aggressively increase her oral water
intake in order to keep her sodium within normal limits.
4. The patient should call her doctor if she has any changes in
her mental status or if she develops nausea , vomiting , abdominal
pain , rash , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or any other
worrisome symptoms.
5. Of note , the patient&apos;s biopsy sutures on her left abdomen and
right forearm were removed on the day of discharge. These areas
appear to have healed well. Her central line was also removed on
3/9/05 without complications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Neuro/Psych/Social: I have spoken with Lafountaine , spanish social worker who
knows the patient and family from multiple admissions. Psychiatry has
seen the patient in the past per her and felt there was some overlying
secondary gain from hospitalizations given her depression. The patient
had declined medication for depression in the past but on last admission
clexa was started. This medication will need to be increased after
discharge. It was felt that the patient would benefit from rehab per PT
and that this would give time for her home situation to improve. Patient
lives on top floor and has difficulty leaving. She is in for alternative
housing.
Dispo: Placement in rehab as FTT at home and requires rehabilitation as
PT finds her below functional capacity.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please return to the hospital with any urgent concerns such as
shortness of breath , chest pain , or other symptoms that concern you.
2. Take your medications as instructed.
3. Please call your PCP for follow up appointment at the time of
discharge from rehabilitation.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Return to hospital with any urgent concerns , otherwise seek the care
of you PCP.
2. You will need to follow up with your PCP for increasing in Celexa.
3. Call you PCP for follow up appointment and to schedule outpatient
colonoscopy.

4. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
5. PARKINSONISM.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old woman with a
history of hypertension , non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , high cholesterol , who presents with
chest pain. She is status post a coronary artery bypass grafting
in 1992 and catheterizations in 1993 and 1998 and has had a long
history of stable angina. This angina is approximately once per
week , always responds to one sublingual nitroglycerin. It is
usually diffuse pain in the front of her chest and across her back.
The morning of admission she experienced shortness of breath and
chest pain which decreased after one sublingual nitroglycerin.
After lunch she had a repeated episode which was not relieved by
nitroglycerin. She came to the emergency room at the Choharlbull Community Hospital .  Electrocardiogram there showed lateral changes.
The patient has been recently undergoing a work up for a weight
loss of 40-50 pounds over only a couple of months. An ERCP in
5/12 showed narrowing in the common bile duct. This narrow was
stented and brushings were taken. These brushings were sent for
cytology and pathological analysis and they were not diagnostic.
This course status post ERCP was complicated by pancreatitis.
Echocardiogram in 7/16/98 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45%
with 2+ mitral regurgitation. The most recent catheterization in
1998 showed the SVG to OM1 graft patent , the SVG to RCA graft
patent , LAD was totally occluded , the RCA was 40-50% occluded , PDA
had an ostial 80% lesion that was rotabladed. This was complicated
by a perforation. She had a short stay in the CCU after this
procedure.
ALLERGIES: Dilaudid which makes her dizzy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting 1992.
2. Two catheterizations , 1993 and 1998.
3. Hypertension.
4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. High cholesterol.
6. Peripheral vascular disease , status post fem/pop and fem
thrombectomy.
7. Weight loss with constriction of the common bile ducts , status
post ERCP.
8. Pancreatitis post ERCP.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS
OTHER PROBLEMS:
1. HISTORY OF MORBID OBESITY.
2. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA.
3. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
4. HISTORY OF CELLULITIS.
5. EJECTION FRACTION OF 40 PERCENT WITH LEFT ATRIAL ENLARGEMENT.
6. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mr. Foller is a very pleasant 59 year-old man who
presents with a history of morbid obesity ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ejection fraction of 40 percent
who presents status post a fall and with increasing urinary
frequency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Neilsen has morbid obesity and is
currently at a weight of 450 pounds
and also has a history of fluctuating weight with decrease in
weight to 200 pounds with dieting. He also has obstructive sleep
apnea on continuous positive airway pressure , history of atrial
fibrillation and is not anticoagulated per his primary care
physician. He has a mildly decreased ejection fraction with mitral
regurgitation and a history of cellulitis. He presented in 4/5
for a short stay unit admission with progressive lower extremity
weakness bilaterally and urinary incontinence. It was felt at that
time by neurosurgery and neurology to be multifactorial and no
consistent with disk or cord impingement. There was a work up at
that time including B12 , ANA and HIV all of which were negative.
EMG showed decreased recruitment in the tibialis anterior and
gastrocnemius bilaterally. His rectus femoris were normal
bilaterally. He was treated for a urinary tract infection at that
time with Bactrim for resolution of his incontinence and he was not
anticoagulated by his primary care physician. Since discharge he
noted continued right greater than left lower extremity weakness
otherwise at baseline health until two weeks prior to admission
when he noted some lumbar and sacral pain , nonradiating , worse
while moving his right leg. Over the past few days he noted also
increasing urinary frequency without burning or urinary
incontinence , no fever or chills and no costovertebral angle
tenderness or pain. No bowel incontinence or perianal numbness or
pain. The night of admission , at 7:30 p.m. while getting up from a

away in a motor vehicle accident. No history of clots.
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is a morbidly obese man in no acute
distress , sitting in a chair. Vital signs showed
temperature of 97.1 , pulse 80 , blood pressure 148/90 , oxygen
saturation 96% on room air with a respiratory rate of 20. HEENT:
Obese neck. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. No conjunctivitis. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous
membranes were moist. Jugular venous distention not appreciated.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Irregular ,

nontender. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft and nontender. Nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and a significant rash of his pannus.
RECTAL: Strong rectal tone. EXTREMITIES: Right calf was with a
shallow , erythematous dry ulcer which was chronic with changes
consistent with venous insufficiency and varicose veins.
NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal. Strength in the right hip flexor was
decreased to 4/5 and on the right his plantar dorsiflexion strength
was 4/5 bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact to touch.
Finger-to-nose was normal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride
102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 20 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 101. He had a white blood cell count of 9
with 76 polys , 4 bands , hematocrit 37.6 and a platelet count of
236. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and positive leukocyte
esterase with 15-20 white blood cells , one plus bacteria and one
plus squamous cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological: The neurology service came by
to see the patient in the Emergency Room and felt
that there was no acute neurologic change but if the patient was
unable to walk he should be sent to rehabilitation. They saw no
new acute change and he should continue to be followed by neurology
in clinic.
2. Cardiac: He does have a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and echocardiogram with decreased ejection fraction
was noted previously. He will be started on a trial of Lasix p.o.
q day to decrease his peripheral edema to help him with
rehabilitation and his primary care physician will continue to
follow him for his atrial fibrillation and he does elect not to
anticoagulate him at the moment though Coumadin should be a
consideration given his risk of stroke.
3. Skin care: Right calf demonstrates a pressure ulcer and the
patient should apply Nystatin powder for his pannus rash.
4. Infectious disease: His urinary tract infection will be
treated with seven days of Bactrim and follow urine cultures.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: To Patient: You were admitted to the hospital to rule out a heart attack
as the cause for your chest pain. Based on our evaluation we feel that
your chest pain is atypical and most likely not related to your heart.
We have made a few changes to your medications. We increased your dose
of imdur from 30mg to 60mg , we changed your norvasc from 10mg daily to
5mg twice per day and we added ativan on an as needed basis for anxiety
and agitation. If you develope recurrent chest pain , shortness of breath
or other concerning symptoms please contact a physician. You may try
taking ativan when you have chest pain especially if the chest pain is
brought on by fear or anxiety. Please follow-up with your PCP in the
next 1-2 weeks to be sure that you are tolerating the changes in
medications well.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV. The patient was felt to be high risk for CAD on presentation
with her ESRD and DM. Will typical chest pain and a positive troponin
she was felt to have NSTEMI and was immediately placed on Reopro and
Heparin gtt , as well as nitro gtt for BP and pain control. She did well
overnight and went to hemodialysis and then directly to catheterization
the next morning. She was found to have a 70% LAD lesion which was
stented with a DES. She was started on ACEI , lipitor , ASA , plavix and
her oupatient lopressor was increased. She did well post-cath ,
complaining only of mild numbness/tingling in the lateral R thigh thought
to be a mild compression neuropathy from laying flat for hours post-cath.
Her groin was stable without hematoma and she had good peripheral
pulses. She was discharged to home to continue her cardiac medications
and follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Madaffari , and her PCP. Her BP was
well controlled and she had no rhythm issues throughout the
hospitalization.
2. ESRD. She was followed by the renal team throughout hospitalization
for hemodialysis and had no issues. Per the renal team she received
pre-cath mucomyst as she still makes some urine , and she was started on
lisinopril. She continued on nephrocaps. She will continue HD at
Paz General Hospital every MWF after discharge.
3. GOUT: She was continued on her outpatient allopurinol.
4. DM. She was continued on her outpatient insulin regimen with good
FSBG control.
5. COPD. She was continued on her outpatient atrovent with PRN
albuterol and she has oxygen at home.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your chest pain was caused by decreased flow to your heart muscle which
was corrected with a metal stent to keep the blood vessel in your heart
open. It is VERY important that you NEVER miss a day of your new
medication PLAVIX because this medication keeps that metal stent open.
Call Dr. Brownlie or Dr. Wendelberger if you have any chest pain , shortness of
breath or any other worrisome symptoms. Keep eating a heart-healthy
diet , gradually increase your exercise back to your baseline and take all
of your med

Discharge Date: 10/18/1990
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1 )MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2 )CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3 )HYPERTENSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 60-year-old white
male who presented with a two week
history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion
admitted with new EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction
for rule out MI. The patient&apos;s cardiac risk factors are diabetes ,
hypertension , distant smoking history. There is no history of
increased cholesterol and no family history of heart disease. The
patient noted the onset of exertional shortness of breath around
the beginning of 10 of October .  At that time the patient was experiencing
increased stress because of the recent death of the patient&apos;s
sister-in-law. The patient consulted his local physician , Dr.
Bret Langner , on 14 of October .  An EKG at that time showed no change
from an EKG of a year earlier. Over the next week the patient
reported feeling weak , general malaise , experienced occasional
chills with continuing dyspnea on exertion. There was one event on
7 of July where the patient experienced chest pain with severe
diaphoresis and a chill which he attributed to the flu although the
patient did not seek medical attention at that time. Over the last
10 to 14 days prior to admission the patient noted increasing
exertional dyspnea , three episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
associated with right chest discomfort. There was no nausea ,
vomiting , diaphoresis , cyanosis. The patient also noted edema in
his lower extremities over the last two weeks. The last episode of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea was this past weekend. On the day of
admission the patient saw Dr. Mugrage once again and EKG
demonstrated marked anterolateral changes that were new since the
EKG taken on 14 of October .  The patient presented to the Lacon Hospital Emergency Ward. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant
for hypertension of approximately 10 years , non-insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus of approximately 12 years , left Bell&apos;s palsy in
1985 treated with prednisone , type IV hypolipoproteinemia. The
patient was also admitted for right face and arm pain at the
Skastem, Medical Center in 21 of April .  This was attributed to TIA. Carotid
non-invasives at that time along with a head CT were reportedly
negative. The patient also had a right cranial nerve III palsy in
30 of August .  MEDICATIONS: Micronase 10 mg po bid , Persantine 60 mg po
tid , aspirin one po q d , Lisinopril 5 mg po q d , and Atenolol 50 mg
po q d. ALLERGIES: None known. SOCIAL HISTORY: There is
approximately 20 pack year history of smoking. The patient quit
cigarettes 20 years ago. Ethanol history was social. The patient
is married , has two grown children. He currently works in a short
term storage warehouse office , apparently recently lost his tobacco
shop business and there is certainly a potential stress regarding
his employment situation and recent death of his sister-in-law
following a prolonged illness. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports
his parents are still living , has single sibling who is alive and
well. He denies family history of coronary artery disease ,
hypertension or diabetes. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin white male in no
acute distress sitting up on the stretcher.
Vital signs demonstrated he was afebrile , blood pressure 140/90 ,
pulse 88 , respirations 18. His room air O2 sat was 96%. HEENT
exam normocephalic , atraumatic. Left pupil was 5 mm and contracted
to 3; right pupil was 4 mm and contracted to 3. His extraocular
movements were intact. Fundi were poorly visualized secondary to
possible partial cataract. Oropharynx was only remarkable for
extensive upper bridge work. Neck was supple , no adenopathy. His
carotids were 1+ bilaterally without bruits. His chest exam was
remarkable for decreased breath sounds halfway up , right greater
than left , with absent breath sounds at the bases. The chest was
dull to percussion halfway up , however , there were no rales ,
wheezes or rhonchi noted. Cardiac exam revealed jugular venous
pulse was approximately 7 cm at 30 degrees , regular rate and
rhythm , S1 and S2 with loud S4 , otherwise no murmur or rub.
Abdominal exam demonstrated bowel sounds were present , non-tender ,
liver span 8 cm in midclavicular line. There was no spleen tip
palpable. Rectal exam normal tone with a firm prostate without
masses and stool was guaiac negative. Back exam revealed no spinal
or CVA tenderness noted. There was slight buffalo hump present ,
however. Extremities - Radial pulses 3+ , femoral 2+ , posterior
tibial 2+ on the right and 1+ on the left , dorsal pedis 1+
bilaterally. There are no femoral bruits. There was 1+ pitting
ankle edema bilaterally. Neuro exam was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission sodium 141 , potassium 4.6 , chloride
105 , CO2 24 , BUN 19 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 178.
ALT 20 , AST 18 , LDH 177. CK 107. Alk phos 98 , bili total 0.5 ,
direct 0.2. Cholesterol 236 , triglycerides 320. Total protein
7.0 , globulin 4.6 , albumin 2.4 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 3.8. White
count 6.6 , Hct 39.8 , platelets 260 , 000 , three point differential
revealed 26% lymphocytes , 5.8% monocytes , 68.2% granulocytes. PT
was 12.6 , PTT 31.0. UA was pending. EKG showed normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 84 , PR interval 160 , QRS 84 , QTC 0.44 , axis
+30. The EKG was remarkable for Q wave in T and F and extensively
across the precordium , T wave inversions in 1 , 2 , and R. ST
elevations of 2 to 3 mm in V2 , V3 , and V4 with T wave inversion in
V2 through V6 , all of these changes new since 21 of April .  Portable
chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with fluid in
the minor fissures , question of cardiomegaly , increasing pulmonary
vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical
Service Ri Jotonmavilleceance Lisker and subsequently ruled out for MI
by enzymes. His initial CK was 107. Eight hours later his CK
drawn was 45 and final CK was 89. However , the patient underwent
echocardiography and the echocardiogram demonstrated a moderately
dilated left ventricle with decreased global contractile function ,
roughly estimated at around 25%. There were extensive wall motion
abnormalities with mid to distal septal akinesis , anterior ,
anterolateral , and septal apex dyskinesis consistent with a large
anterior myocardial infarction. However , there was no mural
thrombus seen although occult thrombi could not be excluded at that
time. Because of the echocardiogram result and the fact that the
patient ruled out for a recent MI the clinical picture was
consistent with an evolved myocardial infarction within the time
between the patient&apos;s initial presentation to Dr. Connelley in 10 of October
and the patient&apos;s presentation in 16 of October .  Consequently the plan was
made to manage the patient with gentle Lasix diuresis. The
patient&apos;s beta blocker was held because of the concern for wall
motion abnormalities and possible aneurysm formation. The patient
was anticoagulated on heparin and subsequently was loaded on
Coumadin. In addition the patient&apos;s afterload reduction was
increased and changed to Captopril. In addition the patient
underwent an exercise tolerance test with thallium scan on
1 of November .  During this procedure the patient exercised for 6
minutes on modified Bruce protocol. The test was stopped secondary
to leg fatigue. The patient&apos;s heart rate rose from 98 to 150 ,
blood pressure rose from 126/72 to 148/76. The patient had no
chest pain. There was no evidence for ischemia. Thallium images
showed a moderately severe perfusion defect at the apex sustained
to the low anterior wall , inferolateral wall , and septum. This
defect was unchanged on late images. There were , therefore , no
signs of ischemia , however , there was some mild transient loss of
uptake consistent with CHF. The overall impression was of a fixed
defect consistent with an evolved myocardial infarction. Because
of the evidence for an evolved myocardial infarction the decision
was made that this patient would not be a candidate for coronary
artery bypass grafting and so cardiac catheterization was deferred
at this time. The patient was discharged to home on 16 of April .  At
the time of discharge a UA and sediment were pending.

IDENTIFICATION: This is a 35-year-old woman who presented with
left lower extremity pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 35-year-old , morbidly obese
woman who has a history of diabetes
as well as sleep apnea , who now presents two days after persistent
left lower extremity throbbing , cramping , calf pain. She was very
non-mobile , spending most of her time in bed secondary to
non-motivation. She denies any leg swelling , trauma , or recent
travel. She also denies pleuritic pain and swelling. She also had
previous left lower extremity pain and had a negative LENIs in
1993. She had a recent right lower extremity cellulitis and she
was treated in October 1996 with Keflex and Zovirax.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic urea. She is status past
appendectomy. She has had incidence of
diabetes. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as
hemorrhoids. She has a history of depression , hypertension ,
obstructive sleep apnea , as well as amenorrhea.
ALLERGIES: She is allergic to penicillin and Bactrim , which gives
her a rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Keflex q.i.d. , Zovirax 500 five times a
day , Bentyl 20 q.6h. p.r.n. , Provera and
trazodone 150 q.h.s , Elavil 25 q.h.s. , Prozac 60 q.a.m. , Insulin
70/30 which gets 35 in the morning and 25 at night , lisinopril 215
once a day , CPAP , as well as Percocet p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her temperature was 99.7 , pulse 90 ,
respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure
110/palp. She is a morbidly obese , white woman who was lying in
bed in no apparent distress. Her HEENT examination was benign.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination
was without distant heart sounds. Abdomen was soft , obese ,
non-tender , and non-distended. Extremities had positive left shin
sebaceous non-healing ulcer that measured 61 mm on the calf. She
had a positive Homans , positive calf tenderness , but no palpable
pulse. Her right side showed a healing ulcer and covered 60 cm.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital with the
presenting diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of
the left lower extremity. She underwent LENIs which showed that
markedly poor examination due to the patient&apos;s body habitus , there
was no obstructive thrombus identified in the left common femoral
popliteal vein at the knee and sebaceous wound was not identified.
The patient was treated because she did have the signs of deep
venous thrombus with IV heparin , as well as Coumadin. It took a
lot of heparin and Coumadin to get her therapeutic so that by the
time of discharge , her INR was 1.8. So she is being discharged on
10 mg of Coumadin a night with the plan for her to follow up
tomorrow morning where she will be checked for INR once again.
There were no other complications during this hospitalization. Her
other problems were all treated with the medications that she was
on and no other changes were made.

aortic valve replacement to be admitted on September , 2001. He
has had an echocardiogram which demonstrates severe aortic stenosis
with mitral annular calcification , left ventricular hypertrophy and
1+ aortic insufficiency , also mild tricuspid regurgitation and
ejection fraction of 55%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , depression , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , and gout.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Simvastatin. 2 ) Lopressor 50 mg

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Native
American female with history of
diabetes , hypertension , chronic low back pain who had a syncopal
episode on the night prior to admission. The patient was at home
sitting on the bed and go up to go outside. The patient felt pain
in her lower back and numbness and tingling in legs similar to her
chronic low back pain. The patient walked to the top of the stairs
to go down and last remembered grabbing onto the bannister. The

chest tightness/pressure on occasion that is often associated with
shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She states the pain radiates
to her arms on occasions. She experiences this pain both at rest
and with exertion. She states she has occasional leg swelling but
denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient&apos;s
risk factors for coronary artery disease include hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and strong family history of
heart disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated above.
ALLERGIES: The patient has had a reaction to contrast dye in the
past that resulted in hives. THe patient has
questionable allergy to an unknown antibiotic which causes a rash.
The patient is also reportedly allergic to Bactrim.
MEDICATIONS: Lopid 600 b.i.d. , Axid 150 b.i.d. , Captopril 75
b.i.d. , Cardizem 180 q d , Lasix 40 q d , Insulin 70/30
80 in the am and 40 in the pm.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a housekeeper originally from
Ponce Stertuc Mode She denies tobacco or alcohol use. The
patient lives with her son who is blind and also her granddaughter.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s father died of MI at age 81; mother
died of MI at age 73. The patient has a brother
who died of MI at age 38.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is comfortable in no acute
distress. It is noted that the patient is
morbidly obese. Vital signs; Pulse 120 , blood pressure 180/80 ,
temperature 99.5 , respiratory rate 16 , O2 sats 96% at room air.
HEENT: Pupils are equal , round and reactive to light; Extraocular
muscles are intact. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are
moist. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 ,
S2 no murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. The patient has
diminished dorsalis pedis pulse on the left side; otherwise ,
peripheral pulses are intact. CHEST: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally; crackles bilaterally at the bases. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis or edema
noted. There is a 1 cm abrasion at the right shin , bruising over
the right shin and dorsal aspect of the foot. NEURO: Alert and
oriented times three. There is a right lower facial droop;
otherwise cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor is 5/5 in
all extremities; sensory is intact throughout to light touch.
LABORATORY: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 100 , bicarb 26 ,
BUN 16 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 305. WBC 12.7 ,
hematocrit 36.1 , platelets 327. Troponin I is 0; CK 216. Chest
x-ray is negative. CT of head is negative. EKG shows normal sinus
rhythm at rate of 117. There is a right bundle branch block and
left anterior fascicular block present. There are also Q waves in
lateral leads V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the general medical
service for evaluation of syncope. She was
monitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up on
cardiac monitor. The patient underwent echocardiography which
showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of
80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also noted
mild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Due
to the worrisome nature of patient&apos;s history of angina-like
symptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which
revealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximal
stenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%
and the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that this
represented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source
of the patient&apos;s syncopal episode. The patient also underwent
electrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular
arrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patient
continued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor
throughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiac
cath well and did well during the postprocedure period. The
patient&apos;s diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may
contribute to heart block given the fact that she has a
bifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. The
patient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primary
care physician , Dr. Mendoca .
MEDICATIONS: On discharge , Captopril 75 b.i.d. , Nifedipine XL 90 q
d , Lopid 600 b.i.d. , Axid 150 b.i.d. , Lasix 40 q d ,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 68-year-old female with diastolic heart failure ,
hypertension , and diabetes , who is status post a perforated
duodenal ulcer repaired on 8/13/05 at an outside hospital. The
patient&apos;s course at the outside hospital was complicated by
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and
hypotension that required pressor support with Neo-Synephrine.
After aggressive diureses , she was extubated and on 5/29/05 , the
patient was transferred to Erverv Medical Center on
facemask. On 4/29/05 , the patient was found to have a left
upper lobe pulmonary embolism on chest CT and was started on
heparin drip. At that time , a chest tube was placed for removal of left
pleural effusion. Upon manipulation of the chest tubes , the
patient was noted to desaturate and required intubation.
Bronchoscopy was performed with copious secretions.
Echocardiogram on 4/29/05 showed moderate pericardial effusion
and evidence of right ventricular strain. At this time , the
patient was transferred to the CCU for further care.

VITALS AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER TO THE CCU:
Temperature 102 , pulse 100-113 , blood pressure 86-125/39-50. The
patient was ventilated on assist control , tidal volume 400 ,
respiratory rate of 14 , overbreathing at 27 , PEEP of 10 with PIP
of 33 , saturating 92% on 95% FiO2. Physical examination revealed
a patient who was intubated and only mildly responsive to
stimuli. The patient&apos;s cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 ,
a possible S4 with no evidence of murmur. Her JVP was not
assessable at the time of transfer. Pulmonary exam revealed the
lungs that were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen
was soft. The patient grimaces with deep palpation to the right
lower quadrant. Her extremities were warm with no evidence of
rash and good pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs at the time of transfer to the CCU revealed a white cell
count of 13.3 , hematocrit of 30.8 , a platelet count of 200 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 13 , creatinine of
0.5 , and glucose 131. PTT was 32.6 , INR 1.4. LFTs were normal
other than a mildly elevated total bilirubin at 1.1. CK was 27.
MB was 0.4. Troponin was 0.22.
STUDIES PERFORMED DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:
The patient had a chest CT on 4/29/05 that revealed left upper
lobe and lingular branch pulmonary embolism , but no evidence of
DVT. Her most recent chest CT done on 6/21/06 revealed
segmental atelectasis involving the posterior basal
and lateral basal segments of the left lower lobe , minimal
left-sided effusion , and slight improvement of opacities in
the upper lobe due to improving pneumonia. Abdominal CT
on 4/29/05 , revealed no evidence of free intraperitoneal gas or
extravasation of oral contrast to suggest persistent bowel
perforation. There was a small to moderate amount of ascites
with a more localized 2.5 cm phlegmonous area in the right
pericolic gutter , not amenable to percutaneous drainage. Follow
up abdominal CT on 9/6/06 , revealed decreased splenic
subcapsular hematoma and enlarged bilateral ovaries.
Transvaginal ultrasound on 8/26/06 revealed mildly enlarged and
lobular right ovary with the size of 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm.
IMPRESSION:
A 68-year-old woman with diabetes , hypertension , who presented to
an outside hospital with duodenal bleed on 9/29/06 , requiring
gram patch repair , complicated postoperatively by volume
overload , hypotension , pulmonary embolism , Enterobacter
pneumonia , and coag-negative Staph bacteremia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1. Infectious disease:
A. Enterobacter pneumonia: The patient completed a 14-day
course of imipenem for Enterobacter pneumonia. Chest CT on
10/22/05 showed resolving pneumonia. Sputum culture from
8/7/06 , revealed Enterobacter and MRSA. The sputum cultures
through 7/21/06 showed persistent Enterobacter. As the patient
was persistently febrile and repeat CT showed new left upper lobe
atelectasis with a question of infiltrate and bilateral ground
glass opacities , the patient was restarted on imipenem with the
addition of linezolid per recommendation of the Infectious
Disease consult team. The patient completed a full course of
imipenem on 4/5/06 , and a full course of linezolid on 1/1/06 .
Chest x-ray performed on 1/10/06 revealed no evidence of
consolidation.
B. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient had a urine culture on
7/21/06 that grew 100 , 000 colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The patient was initially placed on gentamicin; however , this was
switched to levofloxacin on 10/6/06 and then ciprofloxacin on
7/25/06 based on microbiologic susceptibilities. The patient
completed a full course of ciprofloxacin on 4/5/06 .
C. Enterococcus bacteremia: Blood culture on 10/19/06 grew
vancomycin susceptible Enterococcus. The patient completed a
14-day course of linezolid.
D. Candidal intertrigo: The patient was put on topical
antifungals with failure to improve candidal skin infection. She
was started on fluconazole 100 mg p.o. daily on 8/26/06 . She
will complete a seven-day course on 10/28/06 .
2. Pulmonary: The patient had a prolonged course of ventilator
dependence. A tracheostomy was performed on 6/26/05 . The
patient was successfully weaned to trach collar on 7/25/06 . Her
trach collar was capped on 1/10/06 and the patient has been
tolerating oxygen via nasal cannula since that point.
3. Heme:
A. Pulmonary embolism: The patient was found to have left upper
lobe and lingular branch pulmonary emboli. As discussed above ,
she was initially on heparin , which was discontinued on 8/7/06 .
The patient was found to be subtherapeutic on her Coumadin on
7/23/06 , and was initiated on Lovenox as a bridge at that time.
Lovenox was continued until 4/5/06 . At the time of discharge ,
the patient&apos;s Coumadin dose is 3 mg p.o. at bedtime. Her INR was
2.7 on 1/1/06 . Please continue to monitor and adjust dose
accordingly. There was some concern for possible right upper
extremity DVT during this hospitalization given the appearance of
right upper extremity swelling. Non-invasive studies were
negative for evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
B. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient was found to have an
iron less than assay on 8/6/06 , a TIBC of 181 , and ferritin of
828. She was started on ferrous sulfate. Her hematocrit has
been stable with the transfusion goal less than 27.
4. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: No active issues.
B. Pump: The patient had an echocardiogram done on 4/13/05 ,
revealing normal LV function and size , and an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no akinesis , mild right ventricular enlargement ,
moderate right ventricular global dysfunction , normal left
atrium , and right atrium , normal valves , and small circumscribed
pericardial effusion. The patient had evidence of fluid overload
on transfer to this hospital. She has been successfully diuresed
down to her dry weight of 100 kg. She was recently on
torsemide 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. that has been weaned off due to
concerns of increasing BUN and bicarbonate in the setting of
aggressive diureses. Please continue to monitor weights and dose
torsemide for concern of worsening fluid overload.
C. Rhythm: The patient has had a tachycardia , thought to be
secondary to fever and pulmonary embolism. Her heart rate the
day prior to discharge was 87-104.
5. Gynecologic: The patient has bilateral enlarged ovaries on
abdominal CT , confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound on 8/26/06 ,
revealing a mildly enlarged and lobular right ovary with the size
of 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm. The patient has a known history of enlarged
ovary , and comparison will need to be made with prior pelvic
ultrasounds as an outpatient. Recommended further outpatient
evaluations to rule out ovarian malignancy.
6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was
switched on 8/26/06 , on tube feeds of Jevity to increase the
fiber per recommendations of the nutrition consult team. We have
been continuing the free water boluses for mild hypernatremia.
The patient has a history of mild pill dysphagia and esophagogram
during this hospitalization revealed mild-to-moderate esophageal
dysmotility.
7. Endocrine: The patient has been followed by the Endocrine
consult team during the hospitalization for monitoring of blood
sugars. She has a tendency to become hypoglycemic when her tube
feeds are turned off. Please continue to monitor glucose
fingersticks every six hours.
8. Neurologic: We added Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. at bedtime and as
needed for anxiety or agitation. We also have added Klonopin 1
mg p.o. at bedtime.
9. Renal: As noted above , the patient has an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio consistent with prerenal azotemia. We have held
all diuretic agents , this will need to be monitored in the rehab
setting.
10. GI: The patient is constipated. She is on a bowel regimen
of Colace and senna with p.r.n. lactulose. She was disimpacted
1/10/06 . She has a chronic pill dysphagia as discussed above.
11. The patient seen by the Dermatology consult service on
4/5/06 for concern of a blanching erythematous rash on her mid
back , buttocks , upper thighs , groin area , and around her pannus.
The Dermatology consult team felt that this was most consistent
with a drug hypersensitivity eruption. As the timing of the
rash was unclear , it makes it difficult to determine the
offending agents. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics ,
which are likely offenders and has been discontinued as the
courses were completed. The rash is fairly limited and appears
to be improving at the time of discharge. Please continue
clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day to the effected areas with
pramoxine 1% lotion three times a day , and Sarna lotion as needed
for pruritus. Okay to stop these medications when the rash has
resolved. The patient is in satisfactory condition at the time
of discharge. She is full code.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:
At the time of discharge , her laboratories were as follows:
Sodium 135 , potassium 3.8 , bicarbonate 39 , BUN 80 , creatinine
0.7 , and glucose 60. She had normal LFTs with the exception of a
mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 134. Calcium is 9.5 ,
magnesium 2.6. White cell count 17.5 , with a normal differential
hematocrit to 28.2 and stable , platelets 471 , 000. All blood
cultures have been negative for greater than a week. The patient
had a maximum temperature of 100 on the day prior to discharge
and continues to have low-grade fevers. As discussed above , her
INR is 2.7 at the time of discharge. Please continue to monitor
and adjust Coumadin accordingly.

Discharge Date: 4/2/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old gentleman with a
history of chest pain and atrial
fibrillation. His cardiac risk factors included hypertension ,
cigarette smoking and a family history; no diabetes or cholesterol.
In 3/23 , he sustained an IMI complicated by V-tach , cardiogenic
shock and Dresler&apos;s. He was discharged on digoxin and Lasix. He
subsequently did well with chest pain only on extreme exertion
characterized by retrosternal burning which radiated to his left
arm with shortness of breath. It did not occur at rest. He saw
Dr. Luthi who prescribed Isordil with much decrement in symptoms.
In 8/13 , he was found to be hypertensive with decrease in T-4. He
was treated with captopril and Synthroid. In 6/8 , he had new
onset of atrial fibrillation. He was treated with Quinaglute. In
7/4 , he noted dizziness with decreased vision episodically. He
was treated with the discontinuation of captopril and digoxin was
begun. Atrial fibrillation was again documented on a Holter.
On 6/8/90 , he was admitted to Onlanfalls Health with atrial
fibrillation. The quinidine level was 1.6 and digoxin level 0.8 ,
T-4 9.2. The heart rate was 64 , blood pressure 110/90. He ruled
out for an MI. He was treated with an increase in his quinidine
sulfate. His course was complicated by a five second pause. A DDD
pacer was placed. He continued to have light-headedness without
associated arrhythmias. An echo revealed an ejection fraction of
30% with inferior akinesis , left ventricular hypertrophy and a
small pericardial effusion. While in the hospital , he had two
episodes of chest pain which were abated by nitroglycerin. There
were no brady or tachy arrhythmias noted at the times of the chest
pain. He was off Isordil. The chest pain occurred with walking.
There was no chest pain since restarting Isordil. On the monitor
he was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree heart
block and occasional atrial fibrillation. The T-4 value was 9.2.
PAST HISTORY: Cholecystectomy in 1983; hypertension; decreased
T-4; meningitis as a child. ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate 65; blood pressure 120/90;
temperature 97.5. The HEENT exam was
unremarkable. Carotids 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
The lungs were clear. The cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and
rhythm; S1 and S2; no S3; II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border radiating to the apex; no rubs; PMI nondisplaced;
JVD 6 cm. The abdomen revealed a cholecystectomy scar. The
extremities revealed strong pulses and no bruits. The neuro exam
was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: White count 9.4; hematocrit 42;
platelets 390; sodium 143; potassium 5.2;
chloride 107; CO2 30; BUN 26; creatinine 1.8; glucose 90; PT 12.6;
PTT 29.8; quinidine level 3; calcium 9.2. The EKG revealed dual
chamber 100% paced; no atrial activity; rate 65; intervals 0.16 ,
0.20 and 0.50. An EKG from 10/7 revealed sinus brady at 50;
intervals 0.22 , 0.12; appropriate QTC; left atrial hypertrophy.
Urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.025 , pH 5 ,
presence of urate crystals. The chest x-ray showed no CHF or
infiltrate; cardiomegaly as well as a dual chamber pacer present.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Hass
team. The Metteand Health Center team preferred to stop the
Quinidex at this time and observe him for recurrence of atrial
fibrillation with plans to start Norpace if this occurred. There
was no recurrence of atrial fibrillation while in-house. The DDD
remained in place with settings as per the admission note. He had
a cardiac work up consisting of an echocardiogram revealing an
ejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypokinesis
consistent with location of the old MI. He was maintained on
Isordil and atenolol as part of his admission regimen without
symptoms while in-house. On the prior to discharge , he underwent a
standard Bruce ETT. He exercised nine minutes stopping secondary
to fatigue with a peak heart rate of 105; blood pressure increased
from 100/80 to 124/78. There were no ST-T wave changes from
baseline. He was thought to be maximally medicated. His pulse
pressure product at rest was excellent and well maintained , and he
was asymptomatic. He was maintained on his current cardiac
regimen.
He was noted to have a mildly elevated BUN at 26 and creatinine 1.8
on admission. He was found to have urate crystals in his urine.
His BUN decreased to 23 and creatinine 1.3 prior to discharge. We
will consider alkalyzing his urine if we suspect a true urate
nephropathy.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged to home on 1/19/90 . MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; atenolol 50 mg
p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. ASYSTOLE.
4. QUESTION OF URIC ACID NEPHROPATHY.

Potassium of 5.1 , bicarb of 19 , creatinine elevated at 2.6 up
from baseline of 1.8 , glucose elevated at 377 , hematocrit stable
at 34.5 and BNP was recorded on admission at greater than assay.
EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate
of approximately
80 with T-wave inversion in V5-V6 which were similar to prior
echocardiograms. Chest x-ray obtained on admission revealed
pulmonary vascular congestion with flank pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions. No infiltrate was appreciated. As
such , patient was admitted for evaluation and management of CHF
exacerbation. CHF was felt to be secondary to medication and
dietary noncompliance as previously mentioned.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: Patient with no evidence for chest pain or
ischemic injury. At the time of admission , CHF exacerbation not
felt to be due to recurrent ischemia but rather medication
indiscretion. Of note , patient with multiple prior troponin
leaks ranging from 0.10 to 0.12 on prior admissions. Not felt to
be secondary to ischemia necessarily but rather due secondary to
elevated filling pressures.
B. Pump: Patient with decompensated heart failure on admission
not felt to be in a low cardiac output state but rather just
volume overloaded. Patient was subsequently diuresed using both
IV Lasix and p.o. torsemide. At the time of discharge , patient
felt to be relatively euvolemic though will likely require
further outpatient evaluation and ongoing diuresis given his
continued congestive heart failure. Patient with difficulty
adhering to a 2 liter per day fluid-restriction diet , would
recommend further nutritional outpatient evaluation and
counseling regarding his fluid status given poor cardiac
function. At the time of discharge , patient on 100 mg of
torsemide b.i.d. with relatively good urine output and I/O of
approximately negative 0.5 to 1 kg per day , would recommend
intensive outpatient CHF management including multidisciplinary
approach using heart failure nursing. Patient advised to use
scale and record daily weight , that there have been issues in the
past with compliance. Additionally , patient&apos;s Aldactone was
discontinued secondary to hyperkalemia and instead patient was
started on Isordil/hydralazine for hemodynamic support.
C. Rhythm: Patient stable from the perspective , maintained on
tele monitoring with no events over his hospital course.
2. Renal: Patient with acute renal failure on admission with
creatinine elevated to 2.6. With ongoing diuresis and correction
of volume overload , patient&apos;s creatinine corrected to a baseline
value. At the time of discharge , patient&apos;s creatinine was 2.0.
Recommend rehab monitoring of renal function including creatinine
and BUN every three days until patient on a stable dose of
torsemide and felt to be euvolemic , given concern or risk for
acute renal failure during ongoing diuresis.
3. Endocrine: Patient with a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes maintained on Lantus with Regular Insulin sliding scale
per outpatient regimen.
4. Psych: Patient with a history of bipolar disorder ,
maintained on Depakote. Additionally , patient with a history of
insomnia managed with Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
Patient with a history of bipolar disorder treated with Depakote
per outpatient regimen.
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: Include hydralazine 10 mg p.o.
q.i.d. with a hold parameter for systolic blood pressure less
than 100 mmHg. Regular Insulin sliding scale , Isordil 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , multivitamin , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d. , torsemide 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. given aspirin allergy ,
Depakote ER 250 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. with
appropriate substitution for formulary PPI , Lantus
20 units SC q.h.s. P.r.n. medications to include Tylenol , Ativan
0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , Atrovent neb 0.5 mg neb
t.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ultram 50 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n.
pain.
ONGOING MEDICAL ISSUES AND OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
1. Patient will require further aggressive outpatient CHF
management including ongoing diuresis using p.o. torsemide.
Patient does put out well to p.o. torsemide , though of note he
does have compliance issues with regards to daily fluid intake.
2. Additionally , would recommend further titration of
hydralazine and Isordil to maximize hemodynamic support.
3. Additionally , given hyperkalemia on admission with peak
potassium reaching 6.0 , patient&apos;s lisinopril and spironolactone
held at the time of discharge. Would recommend reinstitution of
patient&apos;s ACE inhibitor particularly as an outpatient with
low-dose lisinopril perhaps starting at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. with
intensive monitoring of potassium.
4. Additionally , would recommend further diabetic teaching as an
outpatient given patient&apos;s poor compliance.
5. Strongly feel patient would benefit from involvement in a CHF
program either through Gon Ce or
through other program.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: Patient to follow up with primary care
physician , Dr. Marion Salser , at the Pressou Healthcare Center .  Please call for follow-up appointment.

ATTENDING: GOSNELL , BRICE M.D.
PRELIMINARY DISCHARGE SUMMARY.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE: Aspiration pneumonia , line
infection , refractor asthma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 59-year-old female well
known to the team on admission with a history of COPD/asthma ,
history of intubation , CHF ( EF of 30% ) , diabetes , schizoaffective
disorder who presents with worsening shortness of breath and
dyspnea as well as night sweats from Landall Medical Center .  She was
discharged from GMS to rehab on January after being admitted
for shortness of breath and treated as a COPD flare with one week
of azithromycin , prednisone taper and nebulizer treatments. She
was discharged with good O2 sats in the 90s on two liters ( her
home O2 requirement is 2 liters ). Now she presents with
worsening shortness of breath , night sweats and cough which is
productive. She denies chest pain , palpitations ,
lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. She also finished a
course of levofloxacin after an admit from July to 2 of May for
similar symptoms.
She was transferred from the Landchi Vier Community Hospital to Townfaxt Medical Center ED with
vital signs at that time were 99.5 , heart rate of 120 , blood
pressure of 105/35 , and a respiratory rate of 36 , and 81% on room
air and 86% on 5 liters. She received 1 mg of Ativan , 5 duonebs ,
500 mg IV of clindamycin , 500 mg of levofloxacin. Her ABG at
that time was 7.32/82/113 . Her troponin was 0.13 and her BNP was
29. It was thought that she required ICU care and since no beds
were available at Morei Horan Winblo Health Center , she was transferred to the
Ceville Tianfaulkharb Medical Center . Her vital signs on admission include a heart rate of
110 , a blood pressure of 190/55 , respiratory rate of 32 and sats
87 to 89% on 4 liters , going up to 95% on 6 liters. She received
vancomycin 1.5 IV x1 , albuterol and Atrovent nebs stack as well
as aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for COPD/asthma with last
pulmonary function tests in October 2005 showing an FVC of 41% ,
FEV1 of 0.74 liters , 33% , and a ratio of FEV1/FVC of 83%. Also ,
schizoaffective disorder/questionable bipolar , GERD , diabetes ,
CHF with EF of 30% , and an echo in October 2005 , hypertension
and steroid myopathy.

ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone but has husband who is involved
in her care. Attends Geri-day program three times per week.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Heart rate of 105 , blood
pressure 98/64. Sat of 94% on six liters. On general exam , she
was morbidly obese , working to breathe , speaking in phrases.
Wanting water. Respiratory distress. HEENT: Tearing eyes.
Sclerae anicteric. Extraocular muscles intact. Oropharynx was
clear. Chest with very poor air movement. It was end expiratory
wheezes throughout. Her cardiovascular: JVP not visualized
secondary to body habitus. Tachycardic. Distant heart sounds.
Abdomen was soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Her
extremities: There was 2+ edema to the knee level.
LABS: Remarkable labs on admission include a creatinine of 1.7 ,
a bicarb of 38 , her BNP was 29 , troponin was 0.13. Her crit was
32.4 , white blood count 7.6 , and platelets 267. On the
differential her white blood count was 93 polys , no bands. Coags
were within normal limits. Her UA was ??__??. EKG showed sinus
tachycardia 106 , some T-wave inversions in lead 1 , some
flattening in lead 5 , but essentially unchanged from prior.
Chest x-ray: Portable AP view with stable cardiomegaly ,
questionable of lower lobe infiltrate but no evidence of CHF.
ANALYSIS AND PLAN: On admission , this is a 59-year-old female
with history of recent COPD and asthma exacerbation , diabetes ,
CHF , who presents with worsening shortness of breath and
suspected right middle lobe pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary: The patient presented with hypercarbic , hypoxemic
respiratory distress , most likely secondary to a recurrent
pneumonia in the setting of her baseline obstructive/restrictive
pulmonary disease. She was not found to be volume overloaded on
admission , and she had a D-Dimer that was negative as well. Her
restrictive lung disease is most likely secondary to her body
habitus leading to obesity hyperventilation syndrome and her
obstructive disease have components of asthma since has
responsive bronchodilation after beta-agonist. The management of
her respiratory status involved initially starting on steroids ,
prednisone 60 mg , frequent nebs , as well as continuing her Advair
and Singulair. It was also planned to use BiPAP since she might
have sleep apnea component despite no objective data supporting
that. She on second day of hospital stay , was under increased
respiratory distress. A repeat blood gas showed a pH of 7.27 , a
PCO2 of 88 , and a PO2 of 82 on 50% of O2. Since clinically
patient was deteriorating , it was decided that she would benefit
of intubation. The patient was intubated on May and was
placed on AC mode. On ventilation , the patient initially
required AC since she was not able to maintain good total volumes
on pressure support. Multiple times that it was attempted to
wean her off the ventilator , she developed increased respiratory
distress and decreased total volume with ventilator mechanics
showing increased airway resistance. Despite frequent nebs , she
was unable to be weaned off the ventilator. On January , after
multiple attempts , it was decided that she would benefit from
longterm ventilatory support. She underwent a PEG and
tracheostomy placement by Dr. Rosaro with no complications. Since
January , her ventilatory settings were decreased to pressure
support with peep of 5 and a pressure support of 10. She had two
recurrent episodes of increased respiratory distress when moved
in bed. It was suspected that her respiratory distress was
related to a mechanical obstruction of her tracheostomy and prior
to discharge , she will be getting a different trach recommended
by surgery which will minimize this mechanical obstruction.
Otherwise , she is currently on 40% of FIO2 and a peep of 5 ,
pressure support of 12 and at those settings she is getting tidal
volumes in the range from 380 to 450 and O2 sats between 98 and
100%.
2. ID: Her chest x-ray had a suspected right middle lobe
infiltrate in addition to the fever and increased white blood
count. It was decided that she would benefit from nosocomial
pneumonia coverage. Her first course of antibiotics included
levo , clinda. , as well as vancomycin. Cultures of her sputum and
blood were sent , were negative. Her sputum cultures just grew
oral flora and her blood cultures initially were all negative but
on January , she had a positive culture for staph. , guaiac
negative , in the setting of a central venous line. It was
thought at that moment that she had secondary infection which was
MSSE line infection and all lines were pulled and she was
continued on vancomycin for another 14 days. Her antibiotics
were switched to ceftaz. , azithromycin , clindamycin and
vancomycin. She received a total of 21 days of antibiotics and
prior to discharge had finished her ceftaz. and Flagyl. She also
received a 14 day course of vancomycin after the central venous
lines were removed and since then she has been afebrile and all
blood cultures after October have been negative , so about 10
days with negative blood cultures and sputum cultures.
Just prior to discharge , her left IJ line will be removed since
she just finished her course of antibiotics as well as her
peripheral A line.
Endocrine: The patient received high dose of steroids ,
prednisone 60 mg , for about two weeks and had a couple of
attempts to decrease the prednisone but responded with increased
broncho-resistance on ventilator measurements and it was decided
to keep her at a higher dose. The week prior to admission , a
slow tapering was started with 50 mg for 5 days , then 50 mg for
another 4 days and on discharge , she was on the transition point
to 30 mg. She was getting calcium carbonate and vitamin D for
osteoporosis prevention. Her diabetes was managed with Lantus
100 units a day with Portland Insulin Protocol on initial ICU
stay transitioned to Regular Insulin scale. She was not needing
any extra insulin units prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: The patient had recent workup for CAD including
Cath which was negative , but she did have an elevation troponin
which was likely secondary to demand ischemia with spontaneous
resolution. She was continued on aspirin. There was no angina
or new changes in EKG during this admission.
B. Pump: She looked slightly volume overloaded on admission.
She received Lasix
80 IV b.i.d. and her diuretic regimen was titrated and she might
need , once discharged ,
a standing dose of Lasix to maintain her I&apos;s and O&apos;s goal even.
Her blood pressure off the ACE inhibitor on hospital stay ranged
between 112 and 130. We plan to restart her on a small-dose ACE
inhibitor prior to discharge with the objective of better blood
pressure control as well as renal protection from her diabetes.
We will not restart Isordil since patient had no evidence of
coronary artery disease.
Psych: We will continue home regimen of Trileptal , Depakote as
well as Risperdal.
Heme: Her hematocrit has remained stable during this admission.
Since she was getting multiple blood draws , she received about 2
units of packed red blood cells and all her workup for a source
of anemia was negative including vitamin B12 , including iron
studies as well. Her heme ?__? panel was also negative.
Musculoskeletal: Patient had an infiltrative ?___? on her left
arm around her peripheral IV access. The infiltration lead to a
large ulcer which was managed by Plastics. They recommended only
b.i.d. dressing changes. There were no signs of evident
infection in the site and healing since that event has been quite
good. There are some signs of granulation tissue in the ulcer
base but no erythema or pus around it. Physical Therapy has
been involved in the case and have been doing tremendous work in
putting her sitting upright , as well as gaining increased
strength on her extremity. She is still unable to raise her arm
against gravity but she has 2/5 muscle strength throughout and
she will likely need intensive rehab once she is discharged.
FEN: She had a metabolic test performed which yielded a measure
resting energy expender of 2121 kilocalories a day and a
predicted basal metabolic rate of 1771 kilocalories a day. Those
results yielded to an increase in her tube feedings which are
consisted of Osmolite 1.2 at 70 cc an hour.

************** Hospital Course***************
1 ) ISCHEMIA: pt with prior CAD/stent , likely angina 2nd to demand
ischemia on decompenasted HF. cont meds , pt not on Plavix on
admission. Doubt primary angina as couse of CHF/RHF.
2 ) PUMP: Pt with ?dyastolic HF with
acute decomp/exacerbation ( with dietary
indiscretion )- as well as renal failure as poss source of
volume overload. Change to IV lasix 100 BID and
strict I/Os , weights. October Pt has responded to BMP diuresis in past.
Restarted here on BMP w/ limited response. Pt achieved -500 ml qd but
continued to have weight gain. I suspect that fluids were not being acc
urately accounted for. At this time patient is no longer being effect
ively diuresed and will require dialysis for volume overload in a
short period of time.
3 ) RHYTHM: No signs of arhtymias
4 ) RENAL: PT with stage 4 CRI and nephrotic
synd. May be volume overload 2nd to renal failure
in addition to CHF decomp/exacer. Cr. 4 at admission but elevated to
5.3. Given Pt&apos;s current condition , dialysis seems
imminent. October Pt went for vein mapping but pt remained uncertain if
he will accept dialysis as a treatment option. At time of d/c
creatnine now 5.0. Pt will have creatnine checked in 2 days and
called in to following physician. Will HD plan accordingly.
5 ) GI: GI bleed in past , Guaiac neg in ED

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC- sent in by pcp for chest pressure
HPI-66yo M spanish speaking from O Ankament Ta 11/27 had labs drawn at
frelawn dinghung ant hospital .  5/9 saw pcp , reported sig.cardiac hx. and over the past
few months has had an increase in chest pressure , nonradiating , initially
sx on exertion , most recently at rest. On sunday ,
he was lying on couch when the sx started , took two nitro with good
resolution. no sob , no n/v/diaphoresis/fevers. he has also noted
worsening LE edema and weight gain of 30lbs over this time period. He
admits to missing his meds and to eating a lot of salt.
He was worked up at A in Tonusni for several months to
try and determine how to best treat his cardiac disease. Per the pt , they
said they couldn&apos;t do anything for him.

Discharge Date: 1/16/2007
ATTENDING: PAAVOLA , OMAR MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 81-year-old Italian-speaking
gentleman with a past medical history significant for diabetes ,
hypertension , and COPD who was admitted to an outside hospital
with rise in his chest pain. At that time , there were no EKG
changes and the chest CT PE protocol was reportedly negative.
Several hours later , the patient developed left-sided chest pain
with ST elevations in V2 , V4 and enzyme leak. On
11/27/06 , the patient was transferred to M Valley Medical Center where he underwent a cardiac catheterization , which
revealed three-vessel disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hyperglyceridemia.
4. COPD.
5. BPH.
6. Seizures.
7. Blindness in the right eye.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Bilateral knee replacement.
2. Right knee re-operated for infection.
3. Bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
4. Right eye enucleation.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Italian speaking , lives at home , is accompanied
with his son. The patient is a retired farm worker.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Ciprofloxacin , Ceftin , and
Singulair.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 25 orally every 6 hours.
2. Diltiazem 125 mg orally daily.
3. Aspirin 325 mg orally daily.
4. Furosemide 20 mg orally daily.
5. Methylprednisolone 30 mg IV every 8 hours.

7. Allopurinol 100 mg orally daily.
8. Ativan 0.5 mg orally at bedtime.
9. Nexium 20 mg orally daily.
10. Proscar 5 mg orally every night.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs were as follows.
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure on the right arm
108/59 , and oxygen saturation 98%. HEENT , PERRLA , dentition
without evidence of infection , no carotid bruits. On chest
examination , no incisions. Cardiovascular , regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs. Respiratory , breath sounds are clear
bilaterally. On abdominal exam , bilateral inguinal hernia
incisions and enlarged right groin hematoma from previous cardiac
catheterization. On extremities , bilateral lower extremity
varicosities. Neuro exam , the patient was alert and oriented
without focal deficits.
Cardiac catheterization performed at An
on 11/2/06 revealed 30% mid RCA occlusion , 40% distal RCA , 90%
ostial OM1 , 90% mid CX , 80% proximal LAD , 99% mid LAD , and 60%
mid LM. EKG on 5/5/06 showed a normal sinus rhythm at 76 and
an incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest x-ray on
11/2/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient&apos;s hospital course is as follows by
systems.
1. Neurologic: Agitation and delirium. In the immediate
postoperative period , the patient was on alcohol drip , given a
preop history of alcohol use. The patient&apos;s neurologic status
improved with the patient being more alert during the day ,
particularly with family members present. Haldol was used p.r.n.
for agitation during the hospital course.
2. Cardiovascular: On 11/27/06 , the patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x1
with LIMA to LAD , with incomplete revascularization due to
inadequate conduit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and
after a period of observation , was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Intensive Care Unit. Subsequently , during the hospital
stay , the patient was started on beta-blockers and statins.
Later during the hospital stay , the patient became hypotensive , requiring
fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration.
3. Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative day
two , but he was reintubated for acute respiratory failure later during the day
with subsequent re-extubation on 2/16/07 . During the hospital stay ,
the patient had two additional re-intubations for acute respiratory failure
events , one on 11/21/07 followed by extubation on the next day , on 11/17/07 and
the second one on 4/18/07 followed by extubation on 3/23/07 .
4. GI: It was characterized by nutrition deficiency , although
the patient was able to tolerate soft mechanical diet , the intake
was limited. The puff tubes were placed multiple times for
additional nutrition , but were frequently removed by the patient ,
given the delirium and agitation.
5. Renal: The patient had good urine output and the electrolyte
and creatinine levels were closely monitored.
6. Endocrine: Tight glycemic control was maintained with
Portland protocol in the immediate postop period and subsequently
with subcu insulin. The patient was also on prednisone with the
preop indications for COPD and given his postop frequent
bronchospastic events.
7. Hematologic: The patient was started on aspirin and also on
Plavix , given the incomplete coronary vascularization.
Hematocrit and platelets were stable.
8. Infectious disease: The course was complicated by: A )
Sternal wound infection for which the patient underwent
pericardial strip advancement on 11/21/07 and omental flap and
wound closure on 10/1/07 . The wound was reopened at the bedside
on 7/28/07 by Plastic Surgery due to increased drainage and a
VAC sponge was placed. Wound cultures were sent and appropriate
antibiotic treatment was instituted. B ) Pneumonias. Treated
initially empirically and subsequently with specific antibiotics
after culture results became available. C ) Fever , later in the
hospital course , the patient experienced fever without
leukocytosis despite negative cultures. Throughout the hospital
course , Infectious Disease Service and Pulmonary Service were
consulted and they followed the patient continuously.
9. Other: Incidental radiologic finding of a renal mass
consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Urology Service was
consulted and the recommendations were made for no intervention
at this time.
After excessive discussion with the very supportive patient&apos;s family with
regards to the patient&apos;s prognosis , family decision was made to withdraw
medical care and discharge the patient to home with hospice services. Thus , on
4/18/07 , the patient was discharged to home after hospice services were
arranged.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Were the following.
1. Tylenol suppository 650 mg every 6 hours.
2. Toradol orally 10 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.
3. Haldol liquid 1 to 3 mg orally every 4 hours as needed for
agitation.
4. Nexium 20 mg everyday.
5. Morphine liquid 5 to 20 mg orally every 2 hours as needed for
pain and for shortness of breath.
Support for the patient&apos;s family was provided throughout the
hospital course , and the patient&apos;s family was instructed to call
house officer on call if any question might arise.

Discharge Date: 3/4/2002
SERVICE: The patient was taken care of on the Cardiology Min Wahayownvi
Service.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old man with
hypertension , hypercholesterol ,
diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft , PTCA , with known exertional angina , who now
presents with episodes of chest pressure , shortness of breath
lasting approximately one hour and occurring at rest. The patient
was taken to an outside hospital where his pain dissipated only
after sublingual nitroglycerin , then IV nitroglycerin , Lopressor ,
Plavix , enoxaparin , and aspirin. At the outside hospital , the CK
was found to be 400 with an MB fraction of 4 percent. A Troponin T
was found to be 0.099 , creatinine was 2.2. Upon arrival to the
Noirxas* Community Hospital , the patient had 1/10 chest pain and a blood pressure of
195/98 which improved with TNG to 170 systolic and after after
Lopressor to 130 systolic.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
1994 and 1995 , status post CABG seven years
ago , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Zestril 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lasix 40 mg q.d. , insulin 70/30 40 mg b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was a former smoker who quit 40 years
ago but has an 80 pack year history. He drinks
alcohol occasionally. He lives with his wife in Endnai Boulevard , Dumonte , Oregon 38055 ,
West Virginia
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary artery
disease , however , he does have a family history of
diabetes mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs were a
temperature of 96.3 , heart rate 80 , blood
pressure 195/95 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 sats 100 percent on 3
liters of oxygen. General , the patient appeared comfortable , in no
apparent distress. HEENT , the pupils are equal , round , reactive to
light , extraocular movements are intact , mucous membranes are
moist. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally , crackles
in the lower half of the lung fields bilaterally , no wheezes.
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal , no S3 or
S4 , positive 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen is soft ,
nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds. Extremities , no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
Neurological exam , nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent labs at the time of admission , the
patient has a creatinine of 2.2 up slightly from
a baseline of 1.8. He had a hematocrit of 36.8. CK equal to 417 ,
MB equal to 15 , Troponin T equal to 0.09. EKG showed normal sinus
rhythm , first-degree AV block , left axis deviation , T wave
inversion in aVL , and T wave flattening in lead 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Cardiovascular: The patient was
started on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor ,
Zocor , heparin , and a 2B3A inhibitor before cardiac
catheterization. Zestril was held secondary to marginal renal
function. Cardiac catheterization on September revealed occlusion
of SVG to RCA and SVG to OM. These lesions were treated with a
total of five stents. The last OM manipulation resulted in
showering of plaque and subsequent chest pain and EKG changes ( ST
elevation in precordial leads ). Following cardiac catheterization
the patient had no further episodes of chest pain and remained
hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course. He was
successfully diuresed following his acute renal failure.
Renal/GU: The patient has a baseline chronic renal insufficiency
with a creatinine of 1.8. Following cardiac catheterization the
patient developed acute renal failure secondary to IV contrast with
a creatinine peaking at 6.8 , and then improving gradually to 4.2
upon discharge. While in the hospital the patient was followed by
Renal and Urology consult team. The patient had developed
hematuria while on aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and 2B3A inhibitor.
His hematuria resolved gradually. A renal ultrasound demonstrated
no evidence of obstruction , but did show several simple cysts , as
well as a calcified cyst which was further evaluated by CT scan ,
which demonstrated a likely hyperdense cyst , but follow-up MRI was
recommended to more definitively rule out the possibility of a
neoplasm. Ultrasound showed no evidence of clots in the bladder.
Electrolytes were closely followed and adjusted appropriately
during the hospital course. The acute renal failure was
complicated by moderate volume overload in the setting of depressed
EF. The patient was continued on Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. Urology
also recommended an outpatient cystoscopy to rule out tumor versus
Foley trauma as the cause of the patient&apos;s hematuria.
Heme: Following cardiac catheterization , the patient developed
epistaxis , frank hematuria , and coffee-ground emesis ( secondary to
swallowing blood and not a GI bleed ). The hematocrit fell to 29
and the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood
cells. Heparin and Tegralen were stopped , the patient was
continued on aspirin and Plavix. The hematuria resolved , and no
clots were seen on abdominal ultrasound. The hematocrit remained
stable throughout the rest of the patient&apos;s hospital course.
Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was maintained on TZI
sliding scale while in-house , later was restarted on his home
regimen of insulin 70/30 , and was discharged on this home regimen.
DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient was ambulating ,
and arrangement were made for the patient to receive
a walker for assistance with ambulation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Discharge medications include aspirin 325
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
hydralazine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 0.4 mg SL q.5 minutes x 3
p.r.n. chest pain , Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.h.s. , insulin 70/30 40 units
s.c. b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

Discharge Date: 2/16/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2 ) HYPOTENSION.
3 ) RENAL FAILURE.
4 ) PANCREATITIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hald is a 45 year-old female with
dilated cardiomyopathy and a reported
history of myocarditis approximately fifteen years ago with a long
history of ethanol abuse. In October , 1995 , she was admitted to
Elka Hospital with upper respiratory symptoms and
progressive shortness of breath with cardiomegaly. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 15%
with global hypokinesis , two to three plus mitral regurgitation and
a normal right ventricle. She underwent catheterization which
showed a right dominates and no coronary artery disease. An
exercise treadmill test scan show maximal VO2 of 12.6 milliliters
per kilogram per minute. More recently an echocardiogram in
October , 1997 , show an injections fraction of 20% with moderate
mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. She has been
managed on Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. On this regimen
she continued to have orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
dyspnea on excretion. She was recently seen by Dr. Sifre in early
February , 1997 , and give a prescription for Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg. She
did not take this medication until two days before her admission
and subsequently had brisk diuresis. Over the last week prior to
her admission she experienced mild abdominal pain without
radiation. She had no change in her bowel movements. No bleeding
per rectum and no melena but had frequent vomiting. She presented
to the Rin Noa Joneso Memorial Hospital on July , 1997 , with the same
symptoms. Her creatinine was 1.3. Amylase was normal. An
abdominal CT was consistent with pancreatitis. Laboratory studies
were notable for an increased glucose , creatinine of 3.2 on
hospital day number two and then subsequently creatinine of 5.5.
She continued to have decrease in systolic blood pressure to the
70&apos;s and was urgently transferred to the Coc Whitpa Valley Hospital on a Dopamine and Insulin drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the following: 1 ) Dilated
cardiomyopathy , 2 ) Adult onset diabetes
mellitus , 3 ) History of appendectomy and 4 ) History of ovarian cyst
removal.

times a day , 6 ) Aspirin once per day , 7 ) DiaBeta 10 twice a day
and 8 ) Zaroxolyn.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a 19 year-old son with
cardiomyopathy. The patient is a smoker and
drinks three glasses of Rum per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 40 on Doppler , heart rate
in the 150&apos;s , respiratory rate 16 , oxygen
saturation 96% , 100% with face mask. She was transferred on
Dopamine drip of 20 micrograms per kilograms per minute and Insulin
10 units per hour. Heent: Extraocular movements were intact.
Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. Neck: Right
interna jugular triple-lumen catheter. Chest: Clear to

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated for a dilated
cardiomyopathy and severe pancreatitis. She
was vigorously hydrated for pancreatitis and had few complications.
In setting of her increased abdominal distension and development
of pleural effusion as well as sudation for ethanol withdrawal she
required intubation. Throughout her Intensive Care Unit admission
she had a high fever. An abdominal CT with IV contrast on August , 1997 , was negative for pancreatic necrosis and no tapable fluids
collection. She continued to be febrile as mentioned before
despite therapy with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Vancomycin and
Flagyl. She intermittently had coagulate negative staphylococcal
cultures from her lines which were changed as well as Xanthomonas
maltophilia for which she received Bactrim. At the time of her
transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Medical
Service she was usually linked with a baseline heart rate in the
120&apos;s and a systolic blood pressure in the 90&apos;s. The plan was to
restart her at low doses of a ACE inhibitor for after load
reduction , as tolerated. With careful surveillance of her fluid
status and maintenance of weight between 73 and 74 kilograms.
Pulmonary wise she was treated for seven days with Bactrim for the
Xanthomonas infection as well as chest PT daily. Her renal
function was at her baseline at the time of transfer. Infectious
Diseases as stated above she was treated with Bactrim for seven
days with a plan to reculture if her fever spikes. The patient was
transferred on total parenteral nutrition until she could tolerate
a p.o. diet.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient&apos;s congestive
heart failure improved and she was eubolemic
after extensive diuresis. She was started on high doses of Lasix
and then decreased to 80 mg p.o. q.d. with her weight being stable
in the 67 kilogram range. She remained tachycardic in the 110&apos;s to
120&apos;s with a systolic pressure in the 80&apos;s. She was able to
tolerate 6.25 mg of Captopril and thus was discharged on a dose of
2.5 mg of the Lisinopril daily.
2 ) Pulmonary: The patient&apos;s shortness of breath resolved as her
fluid status stabilized. At the time of discharge her lungs were
clear to auscultation and her oxygen saturation was in the high
90&apos;s on room air.
3 ) Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis resolved with lipase at the
time of discharge of 302. Amylase was normal. She had no further
abdominal pain. She declined a nasal gastric feeding tube but was
able to advance her diet. Nutrition was consulted and suggested
nutrition supplements which the patient was reluctant to take.
4 ) Infectious Diseases: The patient was not on any antibiotics at
the time of discharge and remained afebrile.
5 ) Physical Condition: The patient was able to walk and tolerate
light exercise. She had been orthostatic , dropping her blood
pressure to the 60&apos;s on standing up but was without symptoms. Her
orthostasis improved with decreasing the amount of diuresis. She
was scheduled to have Physical Therapy at home after discharge from
the hospital.
6 ) Mental Status: The patient&apos;s base lines at the beginning of
her admission was lethargic and confused. Her mental status
improved as her hemodynamic and cardiovascular status improved.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge the patient was
alert and oriented times three and in
good condition. The patient was very clear about her wishes not to
go to Rehabilitation Hospital and elected to go home with careful
VNA and Physical Therapy follow-up.

ATTENDING: NIEDZWIEDZKI , FELIX MD
DIAGNOSIS:
Respiratory failure , fluid overload.
SERVICE:
Medical Intensive Care Unit.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Bryne is a 67-year-old man with history of multifactorial
hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure with a recent prolonged
stay at the Fordtist Hospital Medical Intensive Care
Unit ( 8/1/06 - 3/10/06 ) who was discharged to Stown Valley Medical Center with tracheostomy and PEG on 3/10/06 . The
patient had done well at rehab with significant improvement in
his pulmonary status to the point that he was off the ventilator
using a nasal cannula for supplementary oxygen only. He also had
significant improvement in his functional status with ability to
stand and ambulate for short distances as well as improvement in
his mental status back to baseline. However , over the several
days prior to this admission his respiratory status had been
deteriorating with an increasing respiratory rate , increased work
of breathing , and falling oxygen saturations. For the last two
nights prior to admission , the patient had to be bagged overnight
and was not able to maintain saturations above the high 80s. He
had been afebrile with no change in cough or secretions. He
denied any abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea. He was started
on empiric levofloxacin on the day prior to admission as well as
some increased diuresis with an increase in his standing Lasix
dose to 40 mg IV q. 8h. According to the patient&apos;s wife , this
did improve his respiratory status somewhat; however , he was
still unable to remain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient
also received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit
of 25 the day prior to admission. The morning of admission to
Ronon Health it was felt that the patient&apos;s
respiratory distress and poor oxygenation were such that he
needed to return to ventilator assistance. The patient was then
transferred to the Prinin Health Emergency
Department where on arrival his vitals were notable for a heart
rate of 76 , blood pressure 123/62 , respirations 28 , oxygen
saturation of 92% by nasal cannula. He was placed on the
ventilator at pressure support with 10 of pressure support and 5
of peak with an FIO2 of 50%. Arterial blood gas at this time was
7.38 , 66 , and 63.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes mellitus ( hemoglobin A1c of approximately 10 ).
2. Morbid obesity , likely obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
3. Status post tracheostomy and PEG placement after PMH MICU
stay for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure , 8/1/06 to
3/10/06 .
4. Status post crush injury to bilateral lower extremities ,
followed by right below the knee amputation and surgical
reconstruction of the left lower extremity.
5. L3 radiculopathy.
6. Hypertension.
7. Left internal capsule CVA in 1997 with residual chronic fine
motor deficits of the left hand , chronic mild word-finding
difficulty , short-term memory loss , mild left lower extremity
weakness and left foot drop.
8. Right lower extremity prosthesis.
9. History of left DVT on Coumadin.
10. Chronic shortness of breath.
11. Likely sleep apnea.
12. Urinary frequency.
13. Iritis: Right eye recurrent episodes , negative
rheumatologic workup.
14. Central blindness , left eye , since childhood.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO O HOSPITAL :
Levofloxacin 750 mg p.o. daily started 5/23/06 , Coumadin 3 mg at
bedtime , Lasix 40 mg IV t.i.d. started 5/23/06 , labetalol 200 mg
t.i.d. , simvastatin 80 mg at bedtime , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily ,
amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 56 units at bedtime ,
tiotropium 18 mcg daily , Flovent one puff b.i.d. , sodium chloride
nasal spray q.i.d. , albuterol nebulizers p.r.n. , Mucomyst
nebulizers p.r.n. , senna , bisacodyl suppository 10 PR daily ,
nystatin swish and spit q.i.d. , Ramelton 8 mg at bedtime , Haldol
5 mg per G-tube at bedtime p.r.n. and Haldol 1 mg q. 6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has lived with his wife though he has been at rehab
since 3/10/06 . He is a former longshoreman. He is
self-educated and an avid reader. His wife is a neonatal
intensive care unit attending physician at Gno Jones Medical Center .
The patient quit use of tobacco in 1995 and does not drink
alcohol. He denies use of any illicit drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On arrival to WBKH MICU , was notable for temperature of 97.3 ,
heart rate 68 and normal sinus rhythm , blood pressure 140/56 ,
respiratory rate in the 30s , oxygen saturation 92% on pressure
support 10 and 5 with an FiO2 of 50%. The patient was an obese
alert man in no acute distress. Physical exam notable for coarse
breath sounds anteriorly and diminished breath sounds at
bilateral bases , distant heart sounds. Right lower extremity has
a BKA. Left lower extremity with 2+ edema with some chronic
color change suggestive of venous insufficiency. Distal pulse
not palpable.
Chest x-ray revealed tracheostomy tube in position , a right
pleural effusion , somewhat difficult to evaluate lung bases.
Echocardiogram 8/1/06 revealed normal size and function of the
left ventricle , normal right ventricle , and a trivial pericardial
effusion.
LABORATORY DATA:
At the time of admission , were notable for a creatinine of 1.3
improved from 1.5 at the time of discharge on 3/10/06 .
Urinalysis revealed 50-100 red blood cells but 0-2 white blood
cells. White blood count was 9.1 with 75 polyps , 14 lymphs , and
8 monos. Hematocrit was 30.7 , which is at baseline.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 77 , normal axis , normal
intervals and less than 1-mm of ST depression in leads 2 , 3 , V4
through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM AND PROBLEM:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure , likely multifactorial from
obesity-hypoventilation syndrome , sleep apnea , question COPD.
Recurrent decompensation was thought to be precipitated by volume
overload and subsequent pleural effusion. The patient improved
dramatically with aggressive diuresis and he was able to
successfully transition back to use of trache collar during the
day , however , it seems that he does better with ventilatory
support overnight and current permanent plan of care is to
transition patient to home ventilator support such that he will
supplemental oxygen either by nasal cannula or trache collar
during the day and be able to use the ventilator at night. The
patient was also continued on inhaled steroids and nebulizers.
2. Positive blood culture , 1/4 bottles from blood cultures drawn
on 7/26/06 were positive for Gram-positive cocci and clusters;
however , he was afebrile and with no clinical evidence of
infection , so this was thought likely to be contaminant and no
treatment was given.
3. Fluid overload. As noted , the patient responded very well to
diuresis. He was transitioned to a new stable dose of p.o. Lasix
namely 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will need to be adjusted as
needed.
4. Hypertension. The patient was continued on his home regimen
of labetalol and amlodipine on which he did well.
5. Diabetes. The patient was continued on home regimen of
Lantus , however , this was titrated up somewhat due to some
elevated sugars the last few days of his admission. He is sent
out on Lantus 60 mg subcutaneously at bedtime as well as a
regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Nutrition. The patient should follow a cardiac , diabetic
salt restricted and fluid restricted p.o. diet. He does have a
PEG tube for supplemental feeding should he be unable to take
p.o. but at the time of discharge he is doing well with a
mechanical soft diet with the above restrictions.
7. The patient is therapeutically anticoagulated on Coumadin.
Indication is history of DVT. He will be continued on a dose of
3 mg at bedtime. Coumadin should be drawn every two days
initially until it is clear that this is the correct stable dose
for him. It may need to be titrated up or down.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , labetalol 200

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 47-year-old female with a history of relapsing
polychondritis and morbid obesity , who presented six weeks prior
to admission with admission of choledocholithiasis and acute
cholecystitis. The patient was treated with a percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube as bridging therapy; however , the patient&apos;s
cholecystostomy tube was subsequently accidentally pulled out in
the weeks preceding her current admission. In the interim , the
patient denied any associated nausea , vomiting , fever , or
diarrhea. She was subsequently scheduled for an exploratory
laparotomy with an open cholecystectomy , which took place on
6/25/2005 . In order to fully address concerns related to her
history of polychondritis , the patient was scheduled for a
preoperative admission and pulmonary evaluation and was
subsequently admitted to the General Surgery Service on the
direction of Dr. Arron Mcdunn on 5/13 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Relapsing polychondritis with associated interstitial lung
disease , tracheal , ear cartilage and nose involvement , managed
with dapsone , adalimumab , and steroids at home; morbid obesity;

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:
Temperature 97.4 , heart rate 80 , blood pressure 110/90 ,
respiratory rate 20 , and saturating 95% on 4 liters. The
patient&apos;s general exam is notable for a morbidly obese ,
middle-aged female. HEENT exam demonstrated pupils equal , round
and reactive to light and accommodation. The patient
demonstrated no evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction.
Respiratory exam demonstrated lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally , but distant breath sound secondary to her habitus.
Cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal S1 and S2 with regular
rate and rhythm. Abdomen was noted to morbidly obese , soft ,
nondistended with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
Extremities noted to demonstrate mild peripheral edema with warm
and well-perfused clinical examination and no evidence of acute
run of ischemia.
LABORATORY EXAMS UPON ADMISSION:
Sodium 142 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 32 , BUN 8 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 120. ALT 69 , AST 37 , alkaline
phosphatase 147 , total bili 0.7 , amylase 20 , lipase 15 , total
protein 6.4 , albumin 3.3 , calcium 8.1 , white blood cell count
5.7 , hematocrit 29.6 , platelets 152 , PT 14.7 , PTT 26.3 , and INR
is 1.1. UA was noted to be clear without evidence of urinary
tract infection.
EKG was notable for normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute
without evidence of acute ischemia. Preoperative plain film of
the chest demonstrated unremarkable sinus and no acute
cardiopulmonary process seen.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgery Service on the
direction of Dr. Morgan Taverner on 1/1/2005 . As mentioned
previously , her admission was scheduled several days prior to a
planned surgery in order to permit adequate evaluation by the
Pulmonary , Thoracic Surgery and Rheumatology Services in order to
clear for her planned surgical intervention given her history of
polychondritis. Following extensive review by the above-named
services , the patient was cleared for operative intervention and
subsequently underwent an open cholecystectomy on 6/25/2005 .
For detailed description of the patient&apos;s operative procedure ,
please see the relevant operative report.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation and management postoperatively. Given concerns about
her airway and for continuous monitoring given concerns about her
body habitus. While in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient
could rest well clinically without acute events. She remained
stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and her pulmonary status
was noted to be stable through the duration of her initial
admission to the Intensive Care Unit. Following closed
observation in the ICU , the patient was subsequently cleared for
transfer to the regular patient floor on postoperative day number
one , 4/1/2005 . While on the regular floor , the patient
initially progressed well clinically. She was successfully
weaned from IV analgesia and was transitioned to oral pain
medications without complications. She initially remained stable
from a cardiovascular perspective and was noted to demonstrate a
stable wound exam with declining liver function studies through
postoperative day #2 , 2005.
At this point , once the patient was deemed stable for discharge
to home , she demonstrated an acute episode of increased work of
breathing and shortness of breath with an abrupt increase in her
oxygen requirements. Despite aggressive attempts to improve
oxygenation through noninvasive means , the patient proved to
unable to achieve oxygenation status with these measures and was
transferred emergently to the Intensive Care Unit for intubation.
Of note , arterial blood gas drawn in the context of this episode
demonstrated a widened A-a gradient concerning for a possible
coronary embolus. Given the patient&apos;s habitus and her weight ,
however , she was deemed inappropriate for a PE protocol scanning
and was treated presumptively for pulmonary embolus. The
remainder of the patient&apos;s admission was spent in the Intensive
Care Unit and was punctuated by respiratory failure , suspected
pulmonary embolus requiring ongoing heparin therapy , development
of intraabdominal bile leak requiring repeat exploratory
laparotomy and drainage procedure.
The subjects of the patient&apos;s admission will be further described
by system as follows:
1. Neurological: For the duration of her extended stay in the
Intensive Care Unit , the patient remained adequately sedated with
IV agents including fentanyl and Versed. Of note , the patient
was noted to demonstrate massive requirements of sedating
analgesic agents in order to provide adequate comfort. Despite
this , however , she was successfully weaned to a regimen of
intermittent opioid dosing via her G-tube , which she was noted to
tolerate without complication. With gradual withdrawal of her
sedating agents , the patient was noted to be appropriate and
responsive and demonstrated no evidence of neurological
compromise. Of note , the patient at no demonstrated any evidence
of acute neurological events or cerebrovascular accidents
necessitating further evaluation from a neurological perspective.
At the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to be alert ,
oriented and comfortable on an analgesia regimen consisting of
stable fentanyl infusion and p.r.n. oxycodone. She was noted to
move all extremities to command , noted to be appropriate to
questioning , demonstrates no evidence of neurological compromise
on gross exam.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient&apos;s Intensive Care Unit stay was
punctuated by progressive septic physiology requiring ongoing
pressor support for a period of several weeks in order to
maintain adequate profusion pressures. As her intraabdominal
process progressed , the patient was noted to require increasing
support with multiple agents including neosynephrine and
vasopressin; however , following appropriate surgical debridement
of her intraabdominal bile collection , she was gradually
successfully weaned from pressor agents and at no point
afterwards required further aggressive pressure therapy in order
to maintain adequate pressures. She at no point demonstrated any
evidence of acute myocardial ischemia despite multiple rule out
protocols in the setting of hypertensive episodes. Serial
bedside echocardiograms demonstrated no evidence of acute
myocardial dysfunction or diminution of ejection fraction and she
subsequently was noted to stabilize from cardiovascular
perspective. Of note , over the course of her admission , the
patient was noted to demonstrate periodic episodes of idiopathic
bradycardia unrelated to oxygenation status; however , she at no
point required external pacing or atropine therapy in order to
treat such episodes and was noted on all occasions as
spontaneously resolved her bradycardic episodes. At the time of
this dictation , the patient is noted to be stable with regular
rate and rhythm and no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction.
She is free of pressor support and continues on a standing
regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per J-tube q.6h. without complication.
Followup EKG demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and
she has been free of episodes of bradycardia for at least the
past 10 days.
3. Pulmonary: As described above , the inciting events for the
patient&apos;s return to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day
#2 was noted to be acute respiratory distress secondary to
presumed pulmonary embolus. Unfortunately , the patient&apos;s body
habitus precluded her from a definitive pulmonary embolus
protocol CT scan and she was therefore started empirically on IV
heparin therapy in order to provide adequate anticoagulation.
Her weight incidentally also precluded her from additional
studies to evaluate for evidence of pulmonary embolus including a
VQ scan , thus her PE treatment regimen was based on empiric
evidence only. Following institution of heparin therapy , the
patient&apos;s oxygenation status was noted to gradually improve ,
although her pulmonary status was noted to decline with
subsequent increase in fluid requirements given her septic
physiology. Serial day x-rays performed in Intensive Care Unit
demonstrated evidence of fluid overload through the course of her
stay , which also likely compromised her oxygen status initially.
Given her ongoing requirement for pressor therapy while following
the development of her intraabdominal pathology , the patient was
recommended for a tracheostomy procedure given the expectation of
prolonged mechanical ventilation requirements. She therefore
underwent PEG placement on 3/11/2005 following an extensive
discussion with the patient&apos;s family regarding her likely
prognosis. For a detailed discussion of this procedure in the
context of a concomitant repeat exploratory laparotomy and
J-tube/G-tube insertion , please see relevant operative report.
Following placement of this tracheostomy , the patient progressed
well clinically from respiratory perspective. Following drainage
of her intraabdominal bile leak , the patient&apos;s septic physiology
was noted to gradually resolve and she was successfully weaned
from pressor therapy. With cessation of her pressors , adequate
diuresis was rendered possible and the patient was effectively
fluid oscillated for the duration of her Intensive Care Unit
stay.
With the fluid oscillating , the patient&apos;s respiratory status
continued to improve as such her serial chest x-ray demonstrated
gradually resolving over load. With diuresis , the patient was
subsequently gradually weaned from pressor support to successful
trach collar trials , which she accomplished without complication.
As the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to be
tolerating to the extended trach collar trials during the day
with planned ventilatory arrest at night. Her respiratory exam
demonstrated lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with
mild bibasilar crackles and no additional evidence of acute
respiratory failure. Her trach site is clean , dry , and intact
with no evidence of cuff leak. The patient is successfully
tolerating trials of a Passe Muir valve , which has provided her
with ability to vocalize while on her trach collar trials. A
potential plan for trach tube downsizing has been deferred for
the movement given concerns about the risk of returning the
patient to the operating room for this procedure. Given the lack
of acute indication for such a procedure , it has been deemed best
to defer such an intervention until such surgery deemed
absolutely necessary.
4. GI: Shortly , following the patient&apos;s readmission to the
Intensive Care Unit , she was noted to demonstrate gradually
increasing liver function studies suggestive for potential repeat
biliary obstruction. The GI Service was , therefore , enlisted to
come and tell me potential appropriateness of an ERCP. Following
extensive discussions with the Gastroenterology Service , the
patient was subsequently recommended for an ERCP to be performed
in the operating room , which subsequently took place on
3/11/2005 . This selection of the operating room as the site for
intervention was informed on the basis of her inability to be
effectively scoped in the Radiology suite given her body habitus.
In the operating room , the patient underwent successful
placement of a biliary stent with liberation of a mild amount of
bilious fluid from the common bile duct. No sphincterotomy was
performed at this point. Following placement of the stent and
successful prominence of the ERCP , the patient was initially
noted to improve clinically with a transient diminish in her
biliary studies. However , shortly following , she again noted
gradual increase in her biliary studies and gradual worsening in
her general clinical exam associated with increasing fevers and
septic physiology. Serial abdominal exams were notable for
gradual increasing abdominal distension , necessitating a return
to the operating room on 3/11/2005 for a combined tracheotomy ,
exploratory laparotomy , drain placement , G-tube/J-tube placement ,
and biliary drainage procedure. For a detailed description of
the patient&apos;s operative procedure , please see a relevant
operative report. Of note , the patient was noted to demonstrate
a 3-liter bile collection intraoperatively with no evidence of
bowel injury or ischemia upon performing of this procedure.
Multiple intraabdominal drains were placed and no evidence of
active bile leak was noted at the time of this procedure.
Postoperatively , the patient progressed well clinically. Her
biliary function studies were noted to gradually normalize
following the drainage procedure and her abdominal exam remained
stable for the duration of her posterior course. Following
effective drainage of this collection , the patient&apos;s septic
physiology was noted to gradually correct , allowing effective
weaning of her pressor support and marked in all organ system
functions. She thereafter successfully started no tube feeds for
nutritional supplementation , which she tolerated without
complication. At all times , effective GI prophylaxis was
provided by Pepcid and PPI therapy. At the time of this
dictation , the patient&apos;s GI exam remained stable. Her abdomen
was soft , nondistended and nontender with evidence of morbid
obesity per her baseline exam. Her surgical incisions were noted
to be clean , dry and intact with staples in place. Of note , her
midline incision was left partially opened in order to promote
adequate wean drainage postoperatively and to permit healing by
secondary intervention; this incision has continued to remain
stable with no evidence of active infection postoperatively. Her
drain output has gradually diminished over her postoperative
course , permitting removal of one of her JP drains. Her G-tube
and J-tube sites remained clean , dry and intact with her tubes
remaining in place and functional. The patient is currently
running tube feeds at goal via her J-tube without complication.
Her G-tube continuous to vent appropriately without incident.
5. GU: Following transfer , the patient to the Intensive Care
Unit her urinary output continued to be monitored on a continuous
basis in order to reassess her hydration status. Through the
course of her time of septic physiology , the patient demonstrated
variable urine output correlated approximately with her blood
pressures. With resolution of her septic physiology , however ,
the patient was noted to be exuberantly responsive to efforts at
diuresis and was quickly noted to be independently productive of
large amounts of urine without diuretic therapy. She
successfully oscillated her fluids through the duration of her
admission , at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal
failure or electrolyte abnormalities. She at no point
demonstrated any evidence of a hemodialysis requirement during
the course of her admission. At the time of this dictation , the
patient remained independently productive of adequate amounts of
urine in order of 700 cc per hour via her Foley catheter. Her
electrolytes remained stable and BUN and creatinine demonstrate
no evidence of acute renal failure.
6. Heme: As stated previously , the presumed etiology of the
patient&apos;s return to the Intensive Care Unit was thought to be an
acute , hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism. The patient
was immediately started on heparin therapy , which continued for
the duration of her ICU stay until the point of transition to
Coumadin therapy. Of note , the patient required large doses of
heparin in order to provide a therapeutic PTT with hourly
infusion rate in order of 2000-2500 units of heparin per hour.
Following prolonged heparin invasion and gradual stabilization of
her clinical status , the patient was gradually transitioned to
Coumadin therapy via her J-tube without complication. At the
time of this dictation , the patient remained borderline
therapeutic on Coumadin with an INR of 1.7 on a daily dose of
Coumadin 5 mg per day. She at no point has demonstrated any
evidence of postoperative hemorrhage or bleeding instability; her
platelet count has likewise remained stable for the duration of
her stay. Although , the potential for placement of an IVC filter
was discussed on several occasions during the duration of her
current admission , the patient&apos;s body habitus precludes her from
effective radiological placement of such a filter and such
intervention is therefore been deferred at least for the time
being.
7. ID: Following transfer of the patient to the Intensive Care
Unit , she was noted to demonstrate gradually worsening septic
physiology associated with spiking fevers for much of her initial
Intensive Care Unit stay. Serial cultures of blood , sputum ,
urine and biliary drainage were notable for evidence of near
pan-resistant pseudomonas in her biliary drainage site. An
Infectious Disease consultation was therefore obtained. The
patient was recommended for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
consisting of linezolid , ceftazidime , Flagyl and colistin. With
gradual worsening of her clinical condition , the patient was
subsequently started on a course of Xigris for a 96-hour period
per Xigris protocol. While on Xigris , the patient did not
demonstrate any appreciable improvement in her septic status and
she was therefore recommended for operative intervention on
3/11/2005 as described above. Following drainage of her
abdominal bile collection , the patient was noted to gradual
improve clinically with slow resolution of her septic state.
Followup cultures continued to demonstrate evidence of biliary
pseudomonas colonization necessitating ongoing colistin therapy.
With further speciation of her cultures , the patient was
subsequently weaned from all antibiotics except for colistin and
underwent placement of a PICC line for planned prolonged colistin
therapy. With stabilization of her clinical status , the patient
was subsequently restarted on her home dapsone regimen in order
to promote PCP prophylaxis given her home immunosuppressive and
steroid regimen. At the time of this discharge , the patient
remains afebrile with stable white blood cell count and no
additional culture information suggested for ongoing infection.
She has a stable and appropriately positioned upper extremity
PICC line , which is functional and continues to permit adequate
dosage of her standing colistin antibiotic regimen. As of this
dictation , the patient is planned for ongoing colistin therapy
for several weeks pending modification by the Infectious Disease
Service.
8. Endocrine: In the context of her ICU readmission , the
patient was noted to demonstrate widely fluctuant blood sugars
requiring continues therapy with a Portland protocol insulin
schedule. Following successful resolution of her septic
physiology , however , the patient was successfully weaned from
insulin therapy without complication and was noted to demonstrate
stable blood sugars for the duration of her stay. Given her home
steroid requirement for her chronic polychondritis , the patient
was placed on a steroid taper for the duration of her Intensive
Care Unit stay , which she continues at the time of this
dictation. At no point did she demonstrate any evidence of acute
adrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction in the course of her
admission.
At the time of his dictation , the patient remains under
evaluation for planned transfer to a vented rehabilitation
facility. The remainder of the patient&apos;s hospital course and her
discharge medication regimen will be dictated at the time of her
transfer by an appropriate member of the Intensive Care Unit
team.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital on
2/14/04 and was taken to the OR the same day where he received
an aortic valve replacement using a 25 mm Carpentier Edwards
pericardial valve. He also received a 2-vessel CABG in which the
left internal mammary artery was grafted to the left anterior
descending artery and a saphenous vein was sewn to the first
obtuse marginal artery. Postoperatively , he was hemodynamically
stable and was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit. He was
quickly weaned off of the ventilator and was extubated. He was
then started on beta-blockade and on postoperative day 1 he was
transferred to the floor. Over the next few days , he was
diuresed. He later developed atrial fibrillation. He was
hemodynamically stable with this. However , his rate was in the
120s. Rate control was achieved using Diltiazem and Lopressor.
He was subsequently anticoagulated with Coumadin. On the day of
discharge , he remained alert and oriented , ambulating quite well
without assistance , hemodynamically stable with heart rate in the
70s. He was eating well and having a bowel movement and had been
diuresed quite well. He was felt to be fit for discharge and was

Discharge Date: 2/10/2005
ATTENDING: KIZZIE , GONZALO ALPHONSO MD
SERVICE: General Medical Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Altered mental status and dyspnea.
LIST OF PROBLEMS: Coronary artery disease status post stenting ,
congestive heart failure and head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Barbieri is a 70-year-old man
with coronary artery disease status post stenting in September of this
year , congestive heart failure and head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy earlier
this year , presenting with a change in mental status and dyspnea.
After his stents in September of this year , he went to the cardiac
rehab and then home where he was mostly in bed on tube feeds.
His methadone dose ( for pain control ) was increased from 2.5
b.i.d. to 4. in the morning and 5 in the evening and he was
noticed to have increased lethargy. So , he self discontinued his
methadone for two days. He also had increased cough and tan
sputum. Of note , he just completed 14-day course of vancomycin ,
cefpodoxime and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. He also has a
G-tube for failed Speech and Swallow test previously. In the
emergency room , he received vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl.
He had no other complaints on review of system.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post three
stents in January of 2005 for an NSTEMI , right hip placement. He
had a recent aspiration pneumonia , discharged from the Healtten Hospital on
4/30/05 . He has type 2 diabetes , left carotid endarterectomy ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , congestive heart failure with
most recent ejection fraction of 20% and squamous cell carcinoma
originally treated in 1989 in the head and neck and relapsed in
2005. He is status post carbotaxol and radiation therapy.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Include ECASA 325 daily , Plavix 75 daily , metformin
850 twice a day , Zocor 40 mg once a day , paroxetine 2.5 mg once a
day , atenolol 25 mg once a day , methadone 5 mg twice a day ,
Zofran p.r.n. , Lasix 20 once a day , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. once a
day , pyridoxine 5 mg once a day.
FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: His father died of an MI. He lives
in Nah Tonco Ette He smokes half a pack per day for unknown
number of years.
PHYSICAL EXAM: He was afebrile. His heart rate was 62 , blood
pressure 110/60 , breathing at 20 breaths per minute with an O2
saturation of 97%. He appeared tired with dry mucous membranes.
He had diffuse rhonchi on his chest exam. He had a 2/6 systolic
murmur heard best at the apex with a regular rate and rhythm.
His abdomen was soft and nontender with his G-tube site clean.
His extremities were warm. He was alert and oriented x3 on
initial exam but this waxed and waned during his inpatient stay.
PERTINENT LABS: Include glucose originally of 429 brought down
with insulin to 85 , cardiac enzymes which were negative , a white
count of 17.3 and hematocrit of 31.2 , but his baseline is in the
30s. Chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobe
ill-defined opacity concerned for atelectasis versus pneumonia.
A head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality. EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with a borderline QT interval of 490 , left
ventricular hypertrophy and deep T-wave inversions in the lateral
leads but the same as previous EKGs.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 70-year-old man with multiple medical
problems including CAD , CHF and cancer with head and neck
presenting with change in mental status possibly due to his
methadone dosage versus infectious etiology namely pneumonia.
Hyperglycemia at admission may have been contributory.
Pulmonary: Blood cultures were negative for growth. He was
initially placed on cefotaxime and Flagyl and was changed to p.o.
meds , per G-tube meds Flagyl and cefpodoxime. He was continued
on his albuterol nebulizer , Atrovent and a repeat chest x-ray
after intravenous fluids revealed slight improvement. He , from
the respiratory standpoint , gradually improved with marked
increase in activity and alertness by the day of discharge.
Neuro and Psych: His change in mental status was thought to be
due in large part to his methadone changes in dose. He was taken
off the methadone and was eventually placed on Zyprexa 2.5 mg at
night and 2.5 mg at noon. He did wax and wane in terms of his
orientation sometimes thinking he was not at the hospital but he
always had the correct date , correct season and knew generally
what the current events at that time.
Cardiovascularly , he was diuresed gently but otherwise has no
change in status.
Palliative care: Palliative Care made numerous recommendations
that we followed , one was to treat with Zyprexa 2.5 mg at night
and at noon to stabilize his mental status fluctuations. This
came with uncertain effect as at discharge but overall his
functionality had improved and the amount of time he was aware
and communicative was overall lengthened. We also started him on
fluconazole IV and changed per G-tube upon discharge for
treatment of oral thrush.
Endocrine: He was placed on Regular Insulin sliding scale while
on his tube feeds. We also added insulin NPH standing order for
8 units at morning.
Code status: The possibility of DNR/DNI was discussed at length
with the patient and with his family and they repeatedly and
ultimately decided to have Mr. Lieber be DNR/DNI at this point.
They understand the ramifications of this and are comfortable
with this decision.
DISPOSITION: Mr. Mcgown is being discharged to rehab at Emplupe Hospital and he will follow up with Dr. Taglialatela , his oncologist.

ATTENDING: BOLINGER , TERRENCE M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis responsible for causing the
admission is rheumatoid arthritis flare.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female
with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis ,
insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , sickle cell trait and
chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ). For her
rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , she had been long treated with
methotrexate and allopurinol. In 5/3 , due to worsening renal
insufficiency , her methotrexate was discontinued. Following
this , she was seen by her rheumatologist with complaints of
worsening joint pains and body aches , for which she was started
on Plaquenil on 7/25/07 . On 10/3/07 , she presented to the
Ry And Hospital Emergency Department complaining of
total body pain. In particular , she said that her left groin was
very painful , although when asked , she said that every joint and
muscle group was causing discomfort. She denied fevers , chills ,
loose stools , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting or other
constitutional symptoms aside from a headache on the day of
admission. Her pain especially in her hip was so severe at the
time of admission that she felt that she was not able to walk.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Rheumatoid and gouty arthritis: Previously on methotrexate
and allopurinol , but due to worsening renal insufficiency ,
methotrexate was stopped in 5/3 , and Plaquenil was started in
7/21 .

3. Hypertension.
4. Sickle cell trait.
5. Multinodular goiter.
6. Status post CVA , with mild residual right hemiparesis.
7. Chronic kidney disease , baseline creatinine of 1.9 ( ?of
whether this is due to renal tubular acidosis or diabetes ).
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. NPH.
2. Plaquenil 200 mg b.i.d.
3. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.

ALLERGIES: To metoclopramide , which causes dystonia.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has prior tobacco history.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her mom passed away at age 79 and had coronary
artery disease and diabetes. Her father passed away at the age
of 66 from an aneurysm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her temperature was 97.7 ,
pulse of 93 , respirations 16 , blood pressure 151/69 , satting 99%
on room air. In general , she was awake , alert , oriented ,
conversant , but in pain. HEENT: Extraocular muscles were
intact , mucous membranes are moist , neck was supple , JVP was not
noticeably elevated. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft ,
diffusely tender especially in the left and right lower
quadrants , with a question of rebound in these distributions as
well. Extremities: Warm and well perfused , no
cyanosis/clubbing/edema. Extremities: Exquisite tenderness to
palpation over the left hip ( due to severe pain , the patient
could not be positioned in lateral decubitus position to
accurately assess for bursal pain ) , positive left hip pain on
internal and external rotation of the hip , and positive left
elbow pain , along with pain in multiple other areas , without
obvious erythema , effusion , warmth or trauma.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Her sodium was 130 , potassium
of 4.1 , chloride of 99 , bicarb of 22 , BUN of 78 , creatinine of
2.3 ( baseline creatinine 1.9-2.5 ) , glucose of 227. Her white

29-30 ) , platelets of 378 , 000. Her ALT was 12 , AST was 12 ,
alkaline phosphatase of 98 , total bilirubin 0.2 , albumin was 3.1
and globulin was 4.2. Her ESR was 103 , CRP was 151.
OTHER PERTINENT LABS DURING THE COURSE OF HER HOSPITALIZATION:
Her initial urine sodium was 34 , urine creatinine 58.2 , urine BUN
555; urine eosinophils negative; urinalysis showed 2+ protein , 23
white cells , 1 red blood cell , 1+ bacteria and 2+ squamous cells.
On 10/3/07 , urine cultures and blood cultures negative;
8/28/07 urine culture positive for MRSA , sensitive to Bactrim.
On 3/8/07 , left hip washing and aspiration Gram-stain negative
and culture negative. On 7/25/07 , C. difficile negative.
HER RELEVANT STUDIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: On 10/3/07 , pelvic and hip
x-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing of
the right SI joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the left
hip. On 10/3/07 , lower extremity noninvasive studies negative.
On 10/3/07 , KUB showing gastric antral gas. On 10/3/07
abdominal CAT scan notable for bilateral peri renal straining
( old ) , mesenteric stranding ( old ) , left phlebolith. On 3/8/07
echocardiogram , EF of 60% , concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 38 plus
right atrial pressure , trace effusion.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 65-year-old female with a history of
rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait and
chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted for
diffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to a
rheumatoid arthritis flare.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Body aches and joint pains: The differential diagnosis for
the patient&apos;s body aches and joint pains initially included a
rheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease ,
intra-abdominal process or Plaquenil reaction. Her abdominal CAT
scan showed stable peri-renal standing and mesenteric stranding.
Her creatinine kinase was normal. Her urine culture from the
second day of hospitalization was notable for MRSA. A left hip
aspiration was attempted by Interventional Radiology; no fluid
was obtainable , so a washing followed by drainage was performed ,
which had a negative Gram-stain and negative cultures.
Similarly , blood cultures were negative , and an echocardiogram
revealed no evidence of endocarditis as an explanation for her
MRSA urinary tract infection. By process of elimination ,
therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains was
therefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although of
note , her ESR and CRP were a bit higher than would be expected
for a rheumatoid arthritis flare. She was seen by the
Rheumatology Consult Service , who stated that the Plaquenil would
take a few weeks to exert its effect. As a result , she was
started on prednisone and uptitrated per symptoms. In addition ,
she was started on leflunomide. Initially , there were plans to
start Enbrel , and a PPD placed was negative; however , due to her
concomitant MRSA urinary tract infection , such plans have been
deferred to the outpatient setting.
2. MRSA urinary tract infection: As discussed above , her urine
culture day after admission was notable for MRSA , sensitive to
Bactrim. Due to hip pain and one mild fever to the range of
100.6-100.9 with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 11 to
15 , Interventional Radiology did a hip wash and aspirate that was
negative , as well as a transthoracic echo that was negative for
evidence of endocarditis. Surveillance blood cultures similarly
were negative. She was started on vancomycin , with plans to
change to Bactrim upon discharge.
3. Pain control: The patient was on standing and p.r.n.
Dilaudid , along with OxyContin t.i.d. , the latter of which she
refused due to nausea. She was , therefore , started on a fentanyl
patch with standing and p.r.n. Dilaudid. She did well on this
standing and p.r.n. Dilaudid. As of discharge , she has done well
on this regimen.
4. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive with systolic
blood pressures in the range of 170s at multiple times during her
hospitalization. This is partly from pain , and partly from poor
control of her central hypertension. She was maintained on
Toprol , Imdur , hydralazine and amlodipine , which were titrated
for a maximum effect. Because of refractory hypertension , we
recommend that she undergo renal artery imaging as an outpatient.
5. Diabetes: The patient was started on NPH , short-acting
prandial insulin and a sliding scale , all of which were up
titrated while she was inhouse.
6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient had acute
on chronic renal insufficiency ( creatinine on admission 2.3 ,
baseline of 1.9 ). This was thought to be predominantly prerenal.
Through her hospitalization , her creatinine gradually decreased
to her baseline of 1.9.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: A separate dictation for medication
list will be supplied when the patient is ready for discharge.

Discharge Date: 9/13/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Unstable angina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Brincefield is a 59 year old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post PTCA in 1990 who present with recurrent
uncontrolled chest pain. He had a positive exercise tolerance test
in October of 1990 which led to a catheterization which showed 100
% proximal right coronary artery and 60 % OMB-2. He had successful
PTCA of his right coronary artery. His chest pain recurred in
February of 1990 and he had another positive stress test ,
catheterization showed restenosis at the PTCA site and a second
PTCA was performed successfully. He has done well with negative
stress test , most recently in 6/7 .
Over the last several weeks to months , he has noted increasing
chest pain with less and less exertion and now presents with on and
off chest pain over the last 18 hours prior to admission. He was
treated in the Canter Memorial Hospital emergency room with beta
blockers and IV TNG which was limited by low blood pressure and
bradycardia. Because of ongoing chest pain with EKG changes , the
patient was taken directly to the cath lab and found to have a 70 %
left main , 80 % proximal LAD , 60 % OMB 2 , and minor irregularities
at the right coronary artery PTCA site.
Because of his continuing chest pain in the cath lab , an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was
transferred to the CCU. His past medical history is significant
for coronary artery disease , hypertension , depression. He has no
past surgical history.
MEDICATIONS: His medications on admission include Diltiazem ,
Naprosyn , aspirin , Prozac.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a white gentleman in moderate
distress. His heart rate is 54 , blood
pressure of 100/60 , jugular venous distention to 8 cm. with no
carotid bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation. The heart rate is
regular with a regular rhythm and no murmur. The abdomen is
benign. Neurologically , is grossly intact. His EKG on admission
shows sinus bradycardia with lateral ST and T wave abnormalities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital and
underwent emergent catheterization as above
requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then taken for
urgent surgery. On 7/28/95 , he was taken to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery , and saphenous vein grafts to the obtuse marginal ,
ramus , under general endotracheal anesthesia and cardiopulmonary
bypass. This was performed by Dr. Gondek and there were no
complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He was
taken to the post surgical intensive care unit in stable condition.
He remained hemodynamically stable over the first postoperative
night and was extubated without any problem. His intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned down as tolerated and removed at the bed
side. He was started on Lopressor and aspirin and continued on
Ancef perioperatively. He was given Lasix for diuresis and
responded well. He progressed well and had his chest tubes removed
and was ambulating and tolerating a regular diet well. By
postoperative day five , a moderate amount of tan drainage was
noticed at the lower portion of his sternal wound. The sternum was
only slightly unstable and the wires all appeared intact on chest
x-ray. He was started no Vancomycin. By postoperative day seven ,
he continued to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable , saturating
at 95 % on room air. His sternal wound remained clean and he was
discharged home to be followed up by VNA with dressing changes and
monitored closely.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include enteric coated aspirin once a
day , Prozac twice a day , Lopressor 25 mg.
bid , Tylox one to two capsules q three to four hours prn pain ,
Cipro 500 mg. bid for five days.
He will follow up with Dr. Lemieux and with his local physician.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 60 year old , black male
who initially presented for an injured
knee , which occurred three days ago at work. He was noted in
triage to have a blood pressure of 210/130 and was triaged to
urgent. The patient has had a long-standing history of
hypertension and he stopped his medications actually about two
months ago when he ran out of prescriptions. Following this the
patient began to note some difficulty with dyspnea on exertion and
has also noted some altered sensations in his chest during the week
prior to admission , which lasted approximately one to two seconds
and occurred primarily at rest. These occurred across his chest
but did not radiate. The patient stated his shortness of breath
has become progressively worse. He has had no orthopnea.
Basically , over the past three weeks the patient has noted ( 1 ) his
irregular heart beat , as if he is missing beats , although he does
not note any tachycardia , ( 2 ) dyspnea on exertion , including
orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and ( 3 ) intermittent
substernal chest pain which occurs only at rest and not with
exertion. He described this as an ache and stated it did not
radiate. The episodes lasted , at the most , four to five minutes ,
and resolved on their own without any other symptoms. He denies
any syncope or presyncope. Four years ago , as mentioned , he
slipped at work , bending his right leg , and has subsequently had
increased swelling of his right knee , foot and calf , also with some
calf pain. Today was a holiday and he had off from work , so he
came to the Emergency Ward , primarily for evaluation of his knee
and his dyspnea. At that time they found that he was in atrial
flutter.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes
hypertension , LVH , asthma , increased
cholesterol , borderline diabetes mellitus , obesity , gastritis ,
allergic rhinitis , depression , osteoarthritis , chronic right knee
effusion , and impotence , status post penile implant.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: His medications include Procardia XL
60 mg q day , Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q
day , Mevacor 40 mg q day , Ventolin and Beconase inhalers , Seldane
p.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg h.s. , and Paxil 20 mg q
day. He has not taken these in the past two months.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with his wife. He is a
bulldozer operator. He does not smoke , drink or
use any drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary artery
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His physical examination showed a black
male in no acute distress. His pressure at
the time of admission examination was 170/100. His heart rate was
in the 50 to 80 range. Respirations were 16. Temperature was
98.7. He was satting 98 percent on room air. Heent was benign.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. The lungs had some
bibasilar crackles and slight wheezes on the left. The heart was
irregularly irregular with an S1 , S2 and S4. There were no
murmurs. The abdomen had normal bowel sounds and was soft , mildly
obese and non-tender. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal was
heme negative per Emergency Ward. Extremities showed 1+ right
edema and some trace , left sided , lower extremity edema. Right
knee was very swollen and he had right calf tenderness but no cord.
On neurological examination he was alert and oriented times three.
Examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs showed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride of 102 , bicarbonate of 26 , BUN 14 ,
creatinine 1.1 , and blood glucose was 122. Magnesium was 1.6. CK
was 385 and MB was 2.9. White cell count was 7.8 , hematocrit 43.7 ,
and platelets were 234 , 000. His PT was 12.7 , PTT 24.4. Chest
x-ray showed increased cardiac silhouette , PVR , and there were no
infiltrates. The knee film showed a large effusion , which was
present in the past , and some osteoarthritis but no sign of
fracture. The patient had lower extremity non invasives which were
negative and a VQ scan which was read as between low and
intermediate probability.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 60 year old man with long-standing
hypertension , now off medications for two months. He
presented with new atrial fibrillation , mild congestive heart
failure and intermittent atypical chest pain. Given symptoms were
predated by a leg injury , his lower extremity non invasives were
negative and VQ scan was low to intermediate probability , the
possibility of pulmonary embolism was not further pursued. Likely
mechanism is poorly controlled hypertension and conduction system
disease causing atrial flutter and congestive heart failure. His
low rate is worrisome for intrinsic conduction disease and it was
considered that there was no need for anticoagulation for atrial
flutter.
HOSPITAL COURSE: As noted , the patient had lower extremity non
invasives and VQ scans which were essentially
negative and he was not treated for pulmonary embolism , as it was
considered to be ruled out. He had an echocardiogram during his
admission which showed 50 percent ejection fraction with inferior
hypokinesis and left atrial size of 4 cm. The patient remained in
atrial flutter during his admission and was coumadinized for the
concern he may be slipping from atrial flutter to atrial
fibrillation occasionally. He was also started on Digoxin. The
patient remained stable and did well. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction. He was then discharged for follow up with Dr.
Gulbraa for his general medical concerns and will have an
appointment with Dr. Linegar for cardioversion and an exercise
tolerance test. The patient&apos;s Dig levels and PT will be checked as
an outpatient by the VNA services and these will also be called to
Dr. Beckler . The patient&apos;s admission was without complication.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: The patient&apos;s discharge medications
and dosing were Ventolin two puffs
q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ecasa 325 mg p.o. q day , Digoxin
0.25 mg p.o. q day , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q day , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.
q day , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , naproxen 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.

b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Serevent two puffs inhaler b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient&apos;s condition on
discharge was stable. Disposition was to home with
services. DISABILITY: Estimated disability was mild.

Discharge Date: 5/18/1999
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year-old male with
known coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction who presented with new onset of dyspnea
on exertion. The cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel
disease and the patient presented for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
peripheral vascular disease , and peripheral neuropathy. No
strictures and no bleeding.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q
day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Aldactone 25 mg
q day , Atenolol 75 mg q day , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 40 mg
q day , insulin 26 units of NPH in the morning , 14 of regular
insulin in the morning , 26 of NPH in the evening and 14 of regular
in the evening.
TESTS/STUDIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left anterior
descending coronary artery with 100 percent
stenosis , left circumflex at the origin with 50 percent stenosis ,
obtuse marginal 100 percent , obtuse marginal two 90 percent , obtuse
marginal three diffuse disease , right coronary artery proximal
30-40 percent , mid 90 percent , ramus 100 percent. Ejection fraction
on echocardiogram was 35 percent , severe apical hypokinesis and
lateral hypokinesis , inferior diskinesis , trace mitral
regurgitation , mild tricuspid regurgitation. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm with anterior infarct. BUN and
creatinine was 1.9 and 1.6.
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was awake , alert and oriented times
three. Good oral hygiene. No carotid bruits.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or gallops.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation to the bases. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender and nondistended , normal active bowel sounds.
Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was informed consented of all the
risks and benefits of the procedure and the
patient was adequate prepared preoperative before the actual
surgery. For more details of the actual surgery please refer to
Dr. Burress &apos; operative note on 5/15/99 . Immediately postoperatively
the patient was taken to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit
where he was admitted without difficulty. The patient woke up
appropriately and was extubated. The patient had cardiac index of
2.3 , was kept on Neoral and epinephrine for pressor support. The
patient was advancing his diet as tolerated after extubation and
was making adequate urine output. The patient was tolerating wean
from epinephrine on postoperative day number one. The patient
received consultation from the electrophysiology service , as it
appeared that the patient had a transient block at the level of the
AV-node. The patient continued to be followed in the cardiac
surgery intensive care unit and an echocardiogram was done that
showed a 30 percent ejection fraction and global hypokinesis. The
patient had a nonfocal neurological exam. The patient was weaning
down on dopamine and Neoral however still continued to need this
drip. The patient also had a Lasix drip of 10 per hour. The
patient was breathing well on the face mask. The patient was kept
NPO at this time as he was not able to tolerate p.o. intake without
nausea. The patient continued to have an elevated creatinine of
1.7 , down from 1.9 earlier and a hematocrit of 32.8 with no signs
of bleeding. The patient continue to have Ancef for chest tube
coverage.
The patient was again seen by the electrophysiology service for
possible change in his rhythm. The rhythm was Wenckebach and the
patient was evaluated for a possible pacemaker. On postoperative
day number three the patient was hemodynamically stable weaning of
of Neoral but still on Dopamine and still requiring a Lasix drip at
10 per hour. The patient was still in Wenckebach and the patient
continued to breathe well however remained at 70%. The patient
remained NPO as his respiratory needs took precidence over his
eating and the risk of aspiration was high. The patient continued
to make good urine output however was dependent on the Lasix.
Chest tubes were discontinued on this day. The patient was
re-evaluated by the electrophysiology service again. On
postoperative day number four the patient received a pacemaker and
Lasix was discontinued on postoperative day number four. The
pacemaker was placed by Dr. Bruess . For more details of this
surgery please refer to his operative note. A Medtronic lead was
placed.
On postoperative day number five the patient continued to do
extremely well. The patient was AV-paced on the pacemaker at a
rate of 80 with a good blood pressure of 155/70. He weaned down
off of all of his drips and pressure support. The patient was able
to come down to four liters and was able to advance on his diet.
The patient made good urine output with only p.o. Lasix and the
Lasix drip was discontinued. The patient was continued on Kefzol
for perioperative AICD placement and transfer to the floor. On
postoperative day six and seven the patient continued to do
extremely well with no change in his management. The patient
continued on his Lasix , Lopressor and aspirin and Keflex. An
echocardiogram was done that showed an ejection fraction of 30-40
percent. There was no change in his management. The patient
continued to do well advancing in all areas. No instability of his
heart. He advanced to a full house diet making good urine output
with minimal use of Lasix. The patient was therefore discharged
without complications and with placement of the pacemaker on
2/8/99 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
***CC: chest pain in pt. w/ known CAD s/p CABG + PCI&apos;s
***HPI: Pt is a 74 yo male with h/o CAD s/p CABG 1998 ( lima-lad ,
svg-rca , svg-om1 , svg-diag1 ) with subsequent PCI to the svg-diag1
( 11/3 ) and the SVG-RCA ( 5/27 ) both with bare metal stents ,
CVA , HTN , DM. At baseline , he lives at home alone. He had been
reasonably active with ADLs and had been chest pain free for over 1 year.
On the night prior to admission , pt. experienced sharp substernal chest
pain 5/10 , non-radiating. He had no associated symptoms.
His CP improved w/ 2 NTGN. On the day of admission , he had
more episodes of stuttering chest pain relieved by nitroglycerin.
He presented to CHC for furthter evaluation and management.
Of note: The patient&apos;s last cardiac cathterization in 1/13
was unchanged compared to a 11/1 cath ( 3 of 4 grafts were patent. The
SVG-OM has a known 100% complex occlusion ). The pt.&apos;s last ECHO in 11/1
showed an EF 30% with global hypokinesis and mild-mod MR.
***ED course: Afeb , HR 68 , BP 128/69 , O2sat 100%RA. Enzymes negative. EKG
with inferior TW flattening. CTA was negative for
dissection. Pt was treated w/ ASA , nitro SL ,
morphine 2mg x1 , and a heparin gtt with bolus.

***HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM and PROBLEM:
CV:
*CAD s/p CABG + stents to 2/4 grafts* Pt. presented with unstable angina.
He was treated w/ ASA , plavix , statin , tricor , bb , acei , and hep gtt.
He underwent cardiac cathterization as described above which revealed native
3vd , 3/4 patent grafts , and a new PLV occlusion which was stented.
Also had overlapping stent to distal RCA. Pt was treated w/ integrillin x 18
hours. He was discharged on his home cardiac ischemia regimen.
*dyslipidemia* Lipids were checked and were TC 117 , HDL 32 , LDL 54 , Tri 153.
LDL is in excellent range. HDL is still low despite tricor. One could
consider titrating up tricor on an outpt basis. LFTs and CKs would
require close monitoring.
*EF 30%* Pt. appeared euvolemic. He was continued on his home bb , acei ,
lasix and nitrate. A repeat ECHO was ordered , prelim shows EF 35-40%
*NSR*
NEURO: *CVA* Pt was continued on carbamazepine for tingling pain.
PULM: *h/o PE* Pt is no longer on coumadin. Ddimer in ED was positive.
CTA showed no central PE. No further imaging was pursued given
that clinical hx and exam not consistent w/ PE. Abnormal lab will
require outpt f/u. Issue of ongoing coumadin for h/o PE should
be readdressed on outpt basis.
GI: *GERD* Pt continued on PPI
*diverticulosis* Inactive
*dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts* Incidentally discovered on abdominal
imaging. WIll require outpt f/u and perhaps reimaging.
RENAL: *CRI* Cr improved from 1.6 on admission to 1.4 on discharge.
Pt received mucomyst and alkalinized fluid pre _+ post cath.
Ab imaging incidentally revealed L &gt;R perinephric stranding.
This is of an unclear etiology. Pt showed no clinical symptoms or signs of
kidney infection. Pt will require outpt f/u and perhaps repeat imaging
ONC: *nonspecific med LN , L hypodense kidney lesion* Incidental finding
on abdominal imaging. These will require outpt f/u and possibly repeat
imaging.
HEME: *anemia* Pt.&apos;s hct ranged from 37 on admission to 33 on discharge.
He should have oupt f/u for anemia + possible colonoscopy.
ENDO: *DM* Pt.&apos;s glipizide was held. He was treated with novolog while
hospitalized. He was discharged on his home glypizide.
PROPH: hep gtt/nexium
***DISCHARGE STATUS: Exam unchanged from admission save for new mild
bruising R groin. R LE warm w/ R pulses dopplerable. Labs w/ hct 33 , Cr 1.5
***DISPOSITION: Pt is being discharged to home without services. He should
follow up with his PCP and cardiologist.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: TO PT:
-You were admitted with chest pain. You were found to have a blockage
in one of the arteries around your heart and this blockage was preventing
your heart from getting enough oxygen. You underwent cardiac
catheterization and a stent was placed to keep this blocked artery open.
You should take all your medications and follow up with your doctors as
directed.
-Return to the emergency room or call your doctor if you have chest pain
or pressure , shortness of breath , palpitations , lightheadedness , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , fevers , or any other concerning
symptoms.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
PCP/cards:
-F/u official read of ECHo
-f/u official read of CTA + ab/pelv CT
consider repeat imaging to eval abnormalities including nonspecific
mediastinal LN , mild dilation of intrahepatic bile duct , L&gt;R perinephric
stranding , and hypodense L kidney lesion
-Consider repeat ddimer ( abnormal here , but low prob for PE , no central
PE on CTA )
-Consider repeat lipase ( abnormal here , no clinical evidence of
pancreatitis )
-f/u anemia and consider colonoscopy

ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient was given
increasing doses of Lopressor for rate control of
her atrial fibrillation up to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. On 2/6/02 the
patient was found with a heart rate in the 30s. It was then
decreased to the 20s and the patient was presyncopal. A code blue
was called. The patient was treated with atropine and
transthoracic pacing and Dopamine for hypotension. The patient was
intubated for airway protection. She weaned slowly off the vent in
the cardiac care unit , was extubated on 9/14/02 and transferred to
the floor on 3/20/02 . On the floor the patient was convalescing ,
diuresing with Lasix 40 mg IV p.r.n. for a goal of 500-1 , 000 cc
negative each day. This IV dose was changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
The patient&apos;s Captopril was titrated up as her blood pressure
tolerated and this was changed to zestril 40 mg before discharge.
The patient continued on amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.day , which was
changed to 300 mg p.o. q.day on discharge. The patient remained in
sinus rhythm with a heart rate ranging from 48 to the high 60s.
The patient was not symptomatic with this relative bradycardia but
it was noted that in the future if this persists , a pacemaker
should be considered.
PULMONARY: The patient had fever and hypoxia in the cardiac care
unit. Sputum was cultured and grew pansensitive pneumococcus. The
patient was started on ampicillin which was changed to amoxicillin

and lytes were repleted p.r.n. The patient was kept on regular NPH
doses with CZI sliding scale p.r.n. Although morning sugars ranged
in the 60-70s , afternoon glucoses were often in the mid 200s. Mrs.
Acevedo primary care physician may want to consider adding a
midday dose of regular insulin.
DERMATOLOGY: The patient had palmar and plantar lesions diagnosed
by dermatology as palmoplantar keratoderma that was treated with
miconazole.
Physical therapy was consulted and gave recommendations about
oxygen use at home as well as use of a walker and home safety.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
**CC: chest pain
**HPI: 58F h/o gastric bypass , fibromyalgia , HTN , DM , s/p recent
laminectomy and washout for infected seroma and washout. She&apos;s had
frequent admissions for atypical chest pain at multiple
hospitals. On DOA , noted that at exactly 1:30 PM had sudden onset of
sscp 10/10 which she described as someone sitting on her chest and
stabbing her. This pain lasted through 2 episodes of nitro sl , a 3rd
dose in the ED , and was finally relieved by morphine.
**In ED: 60 , 18 124/71 , 99%RA given morphine 2mg IV x 3 , then morphine
4 mg IV x 3 , then lopressor x 1 , then xanax x 1. Pain relieved 4 hours
after start of pain.

( new in v3-v6 ).
*****
Events: 5/3 ruled out for MI. Subsequently c/o frequent episodes of
chest pain that she says are relieved by NTG and morphine , suspect
noncardiac.
MIBI results 4/20/07 : normal perfusion and normal EF , area of abnormal
uptake in L axilla , recommended mammogram
*****
IMPRESSION: Ms. Denna is a 58F with a h/o diabetes , CAD s/p stent to
LAD in 2004 , permanent pacemaker for ?afib/SSS , who was admitted with
chest pain that she described as exactly like her MI w/ ckmb elevated.
However she also stated that her chest pain had never really resolved
after her cath in 2004. Complicating factors include multiple admissions
for chest pain , chronic pain syndrome , and narcotic dependence.
**CV: i: Initially there was concern b/c her CKMB fraction was
elevated , and there were T wave inversions in V3-V6 that seemed new in a
non-paced EKG that was captured. She received one dose of therapeutic
lovenox , which was discontinued when she ruled out. She continued to
complain of chest pain throughout her admission , which typically would be
relieved by morphine. Suspicion for cardiac chest pain is low , but a
MIBI was obtained to determine her baseline. The MIBI
revealed normal perfusion and normal EF. There was abnormal uptake in the
left axilla , and obtaining a mammogram was recommended.
**NEURO: High pain med requirements secondary to chronic pain , and
surgical interventions. She was maintained on regimen as outlined in
last d/c summary , including MS Contin 30mg BID and oxycodone 30mg po q4h
prn pain. Pain service was called but did not see her in house and
recommended outpatient follow up with either rheumatology or psychiatry
re her chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. Bladder training can be
considered given her urinary incontinence.
**ORTHO: recent procedure ( 10/24 L3-L5 laminectomy for cauda equina ,
I&amp;D for seroma 7/8 .  Orthopedics followed while she was in house. She
was noted to have a small protrusion likely muscle herniation in the site
of the recent procedure. Dr. Loendorf ID saw the patient and will see
her in follow up. She is to continue the vancomycin through 6/25/07 , and
then the vancomycin and the PICC should be discontinued. She will follow up
with Dr. Dininger on July .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted to Ra Memorial Hospital with chest pain. Your
blood was checked and you did not have a heart attack. You should follow
up with your primary care doctor , Dr. Fogg , at the scheduled
appointment. You should also follow up with Dr. Saxfield , infectious
disease specialist , at the scheduled appointment.
Call your doctor or return to the Emergency Department if you have any
severe chest pain , shortness of breath , fainting , or any other concerning
symptoms.
You need to have a mammogram done as an outpatient. Please ask your
primary doctor to order this
Vancomycin stops 1/2/06 . PICC line needs to be taken out.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) consider psychiatric or rheumatologic follow-up re her chronic pain
and fibromyalgia
2 ) consider outpatient bladder training re her urinary incontinence
3 ) please order mammogram , abnormal uptake in L axilla on MIBI

1991 when the cath showed one vessel disease. He was not
angioplastied. The patient had an MI at that time which was
medically managed. The patient did well until July of 1995 when
the patient had another anterior MI , massive , treated with
thrombolytics. Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%
proximal RCA and serial 70% LAD lesions. The patient also was
noted to have a severe LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
28% and his MI was complicated by a complete heart block and a dual
chamber pacemaker was placed. At that time the patient was
considered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. In
August of 1995 the patient was admitted for non Q wave MI with a
peak CK of 798 , positive MB fraction , and was again treated with
thrombolysis with TPA. The patient did well with no anginal
symptoms but has had primarily symptoms of CHF with dyspnea upon
exertion , progressive shortness of breath , and limited exercise
tolerance since that time. In July of 1996 the patient had an
exercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8
ml/kg. The patient exercised for 6 minutes and reached a maximal
heart rate of 114 and stopped secondary to dyspnea. Given the
patient&apos;s poor functional status he presented for cardiac
catheterization and complete workup for cardiac transplant. The
patient admits no shortness of breath at rest but with 1-2 flights
of steps. He also becomes short of breath with ten minutes of
light labor. The patient also has daily angina with neck pain
radiating to his head which is relieved with rest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CAD , as above status post MI times three
in 1991 and 1995 twice. 2. CHF , ischemic
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 28% since July of 1995.
3. Hyperlipidemia with a cholesterol in the 300s.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease paternal
uncle , died at that age of 39 of an MI. Sister
died at the age of 66 of an MI. Brother had an MI at the age of
55. Positive for diabetes mellitus in a paternal uncle. Positive
for hypertension in his mother. Father died of emphysema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive for tobacco , four packs per day times 20
years , quit in 1991. Ethanol , one glass of wine
per day , quit in 1995. Married times 27 years , three children ages
21 to 25. Retired merchandise wholesaler , currently on disability.

q.day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril
6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q.day , Coumadin 2.5
alternating with 5 mg p.o. q.day , and Nitro patch.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 101/78 , pulse 69 ,
respirations rate of 18 , T max was 97.6. In
general a middle aged male in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light , extraocular movements intact ,
poor dentition. Neck was supple with a JVD of 9 cm. Positive
jugular reflux , no bruits. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm , S1
and S2 , positive S3 , no murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN: Positive bowel sounds , no masses , non-tender.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pulses , no edema. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves 2-12 intact , nonfocal. RECTAL:
Guaiac negative. Prostate no nodules.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 145 , potassium 4.9 , chloride
102 , bicarb 28 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.5 ,
glucose of 90. Calcium of 9.9 , phosphorus 3.4 , cholesterol 178 ,
triglycerides 129. Hematocrit 54 , white count of 5.5 , platelet
count of 188 , 000. PT 1.3 , PTT of 30.5. LFTs: AST 54 , ALT 39.
EKG showed a left bundle branch block with Q waves in V1 and V3 ,
biatrial enlargement , inverted T waves in II , III , and AVF. Chest
x-ray revealed cardiomegaly , DDD pacer wires in position , lungs
clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted originally for a workup
for cardiac transplant. The patient had a
cardiac transplant labs drawn , had a PPD placed , which was negative
with positive controls. The patient had a psychiatry consult.
Hepatitis serology for hepatitis B and C were negative. The
patient was kept on heparin at therapeutic levels and was diuresed
with Lasix. His Captopril was also increased. The patient was
also treated with Isordil. At this point the patient was
reassessed and it was thought that he might be a candidate for a
revascularization. With this in mind , the patient was scheduled
for a ETT Thallium which if positive for ischemia he would go for a
cardiac catheterization. In the meantime the patient was medically
managed , diuresed of three to four liters over the several days of
admission. His Isordil was increased and he was continued on aspirin and
digoxin , on Mevacor. Further transplant labs revealed a TSH of
2.8 , T3 of 159 , T4 of 7.8. Urine 24 hour collection total volume
was 4200 cc , creatinine of 29 , urine protein less than assay. The
patient had his ETT Thallium which showed a question of septal
ischemia with a fixed apical defect. The patient went 6 minutes on
a standard Bruce protocol with a maximum heart rate of 156 , stopped
secondary to chest pain and 1 mm ST segment depressions. The
patient went to cardiac catheterization the following day. The
patient&apos;s cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease
with a 100% LAD. His catheterization film was evaluated by cardiac
surgery , Dr. Wolinski who believed that the patient would not benefit
from a CABG. Given this , the patient received a continued
transplant workup of a CT of the abdomen , as well as a dental
consult , with a planned tooth extraction , with appropriate
premedication with amoxicillin , and holding of his heparin. The
patient tolerated this well. Preliminary report on the CT of the
abdomen showed a small single less than 1 cm hepatic lesion. The
patient was medically stable on discharge.
The patient was found to have increasing LFT&apos;s upon discharge. Subsequently ,
his mevacor was dicontinued and LFT&apos;s returned to norma. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix
80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q.day
( Discontinued immediately after discharge ) , Coumadin to be taken for 5 mg
q.h.s. for four days and then to resume the 2.5 mg
with 5 mg q.o.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with the Cardiomyopathy
Service. The patient will be followed up to see how he
is tolerating his new medical regimen and be further evaluated for
cardiac transplant.

2. MORBID OBESITY.
3. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Zukowsky is a 50 year old woman with a
long history of asthma who presented
with shortness of breath and palpitations. Her asthma is
characterized by multiple short admissions for flares , last in
October 1993 , and multiple courses of steroid tapers. At home , she
uses Ventolin and Theophylline. Her other medical problems include
morbid obesity and a history of alcohol abuse. She has had
palpitations in the past and a Holter in 4/19 showed only three
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. She has also had a
stress test in February 1992 which was a nine minute arm cycle
stress test with maximal heart rate of 128 and systolic blood
pressure of 120. The test was negative for ischemic changes. She
has never had an EKG showing atrial fibrillation. She came into
the Emergency Ward on 8/22/94 complaining of two weeks of
intermittent palpitations as well as shortness of breath. She used
increased doses of her Ventolin inhaler for this and continued on
her Theophylline. She felt her heart fluttering quite a bit and
intermittently , these palpitations would go away. She never took
her heart rate during these episodes nor could she characterize her
heart as being irregular. Prior to the palpitations beginning , she
had gone on a drinking binge and had drank a half a pint of brandy.
She has had a cough productive of whitish sputum but no change in
the sputum character chronically. Her asthma has been slightly
increasing with increased wheezing and she has been using her
inhaler more. In the Emergency Ward , her EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130 range. She was
controlled with intravenous Diltiazem and admitted for new onset
atrial fibrillation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above and also
including degenerative joint disease of the knees and ankles.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Slo-phyllin and Ventolin Inhaler. ALLERGIES:
She had no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with
her two children , has used alcohol in binges , and does not smoke.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a family history of coronary artery
disease with a mother who died of a myocardial infarction in her
fifties.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a morbidly obese black female in no
acute distress. Her temperature was 98.2 ,
heart rate 108 , blood pressure 110/68 , and O2 saturations 96% on
two liters. HEAD/NECK: Examinations were negative , her jugular
venous pressure was not visible secondary to obesity , and her
carotids were 1+ bilaterally. LUNGS: Showed scant wheezing at the
left base otherwise were clear. CARDIAC: Examination was
irregularly irregular , she had distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , non-tender , and no organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES: Without definite edema. RECTAL: Examination was OB
negative with decreased tone. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
essentially non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable on admission were a theophylline
level of 23.6 which was elevated , an SMA 7
which was within normal limits with the exception of a potassium of
3.8 , BUN and creatinine of 5 and 0.9 , and CBC showed a white count
of 6.1 , hematocrit 40.8 , and platelets of 288. An EKG showed
atrial fibrillation at 136 with low voltage and poor R wave
progression. Chest X-Ray showed no infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service.
Her rate was controlled with intravenous
Diltiazem drip which was changed over to 90 mg p.o. q.d. In
addition , she was started on Digoxin and her rate was controlled to
the seventies and eighties. She was also heparinized and
coumadinized and an ACE consultation was obtained given her history
of alcohol abuse. She was not interested in further out-patient
care for this matter but has the number and will call if she
desires it. Also , a Nutrition consultation was obtained given her
obesity and she will follow-up with them as an out-patient.
DISPOSITION: She is followed in WHITELA TANRAL HOSPITAL Clinic by Dr. Douglass Plane
and he will see her as an out-patient in one week at
which time he will schedule her an admission for elective
cardioversion after she has been anti-coagulated for at least three
weeks. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Diltiazem
SR 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Beclovent Inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. ,

oriented x 3. Cranial nerves intact. 5/5 strength bilaterally
upper and lower extremities. Sensation grossly intact upper and
lower extremities , thought some subjective altered sensation in the
lower extremities bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: A 48-year-old female with a long history of poorly
controlled insulin-dependent diabetes , initially admitted
for an I&amp;D left vulvar abscess , control of her diabetes in the
setting of infection , though she developed acute pulmonary edema
after being on the insulin drip and ultimately had a cardiac workup
which revealed severe left systolic dysfunction with an EF of 30%
and a 2-3 coronary vessel disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Infectious Disease: She had a vulvar
abscess , received gentamicin ( dosing per levels )
and clindamycin for the duration of her hospital course. Her
cultures revealed 1+ vaginal flora , anaerobic culture revealed
bacteroides , pepto Strep and Propionibacterium. She is status post
an I&amp;D of the vulvar abscess on hospital day #2 which throughout
the hospital course showed no signs or symptoms of further
infection and the plan is for her to follow up with Dr. Prive as an
outpatient and for her to go home on clindamycin to complete a
fourteen-day course.
2 ) Diabetes mellitus: On admission her finger sticks were 600.
She at that time received a 15 unit bolus with subsequent insulin
drip until the OR. She transitioned to subcu insulin on hospital
day #3 and when her diet returned she returned to NPH similar to
home dosing of 50 b.i.d. and Regular 14 moved up to 17 units b.i.d.
with a sliding scale to cover. Her sugars were in the high
100s-low 200s on this regimen. Her discharge sugars were about the
same and she was discharged on her original outpatient dose of
70/30 70 units b.i.d.
3 ) Cardiopulmonary: On hospital day #1 the patient started with
complaints of cough and shortness of breath with sort of a
plus/minus response to nebs , given her history of asthma and
smoking. She had a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema with
small effusions which was felt to be due to the fluid from the
insulin drip. She had an EKG with a left bundle branch block which
was new from an EKG in 2000. She then was placed on a rule out
protocol with flat enzymes. An echocardiogram that revealed a 30%
ejection fraction , global hypokinesis , moderate to severe decrease
in systolic function , moderate MR , trace TR. She underwent an
adenosine MIBI stress test to show a small reversible perfusion
defect ( diagonal coronary artery distribution ) , severe global
hypokinesis. She was placed on aspirin and simvastatin ( LDL 160s ) ,
Lopressor , and Captopril. She was diuresed with Lasix IV. She
underwent a cardiac catheterization on October which revealed LAD
long 80% stenosis , 50% RCA stenosis , and a pulmonary wedge pressure
of 27. A coronary artery bypass graft was recommended by
cardiology and after a family meeting they decided on discharge
with follow up for CABG decision and planning.
4 ) GI: Low salt fluid restricted diet in-house and started on
Nexium for a history of gastritis.
5 ) Renal: BUN and creatinine was turning upward after the
titration of her ACE inhibitor , this was monitored and stabilized.
6 ) Pulmonary: Pulmonary wedge pressure of 27 , the patient with
pulmonary hypertension likely due to left volume overload. She was
going home with Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. and lisinopril 20 b.i.d.
The discharge plan was for her to be discharged medically optimized
for cardiac surgery , if she makes the decision to go in that
direction. She has follow up appointments with both her primary
care physician Dr. Harland Isaman and GYN Dr. Shewbridge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d.; simvastatin 20
mg q.d.; lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.; atenolol
25 mg q.d.; Lasix 40 mg q.d.; aspirin 325 mg q.d.; insulin 70/30 70
units b.i.d. subcu.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP: Dr. Brehony , for her to call and make an
appointment in two weeks. Primary care
physician Dr. Loren Stivason , make an appointment within one week.

Sensation and reflexes symmetric and equal. Pulses 2+
bilaterally at carotids , radials , femorals and PTs , present by
Doppler at DPs bilaterally. Allen&apos;s test of the left and right
upper extremities both normal.
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 101 ,
bicarb 29 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 298. White blood cell
count 6.0 , hematocrit 42.9 , hemoglobin 13.8 , platelets 237 , 000 ,
PT 15.9 , INR 1.3 , PTT 29.6. Urinalysis was normal.
CAROTID IMAGING: The patient had less than 25% stenosis of the
right internal and left internal carotid arteries. MR angiogram
of the left internal carotid artery showed 60% occlusion and 50%
occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac
catheterization performed on 4/7/06 at Kan Hospital revealed 100% ostial LAD stenosis , 100% proximal
circumflex stenosis , 70% ostial left main stenosis , 75% mid RCA
stenosis , 50% proximal RT LV-BR stenosis , and proximal stenosis of the
right PDA. CABG grafts from prior bypass surgery were all
patent.
Echocardiogram on 6/5/06 showed an ejection fraction of 60% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 38 mmHg and peak gradient
of 67 mmHg , calculated valve area was estimated at 0.7 sq cm.
There was mild mitral valve insufficiency. An EKG on 5/27/06
showed first-degree AV block with a heart rate of 62 and inverted
T waves in leads I , aVL and V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray on 7/6/06 was consistent with congestive heart
failure and revealed aortic calcifications and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 7/6/06 for
completion of his preoperative workup. He was brought to the
operating room on 10/22/06 where Dr. Luangrath performed a reoperative
sternotomy and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
using a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 186 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 77 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. Over
the next few days , the patient was extubated. He had episodes of
uncontrolled hypertension and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.
By postoperative day #4 , the patient had been weaned off his
drips and his blood pressure was well controlled. He had been
hemodynamically stable and afebrile in the Intensive Care Unit.
He was ready for transfer to the regular hospital floor for the
remainder of his recovery. At that point , the patient demonstrated
postoperative confusion , particularly at night. The
patient&apos;s neurological exam was otherwise normal. The patient
was started on cardiac medications including captopril , Lopressor
and aspirin. He had been extubated without complication and was
oxygenating well with the support of 1 liter of oxygen via nasal
cannula. He had no respiratory issues. The patient was seen by
the Speech and Swallow Service for his history of dysphagia and
was cleared for mechanical soft diet with nectar-thick liquids
and crushed pills. The patient&apos;s diet was advanced as tolerated.
He exhibited adequate urine output with diuretics
postoperatively for fluid retention. The patient was followed by
the Diabetes Management Service in the postoperative period for
his history of diabetes. He was initially on an insulin drip and
then weaned to a NovoLog sliding scale with supplemental Lantus
insulin in the evenings. The patient&apos;s hematocrit had dropped to
22 on postoperative operative day #3 and he was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit
bumped to 26. On postoperative days #4 through #6 , the patient
continued his slow steady progress. The neurology team who had
visited him after surgery after his mental status changes
recommended holding his Sinemet and only to restart if his
Parkinson symptoms reoccur. Otherwise , the patient
experienced some hypertension and his blood pressure medications
were titrated accordingly. The patient remained in a sinus
rhythm. By postoperative day #6 , his blood pressure was stable.
He was oxygenating well on room air and was ambulating
comfortably in the halls. He had a sitter accompany him in his
room for impulsivity , however , this became unnecessary after
postoperative day #6. A PA and lateral chest x-ray looked clear
with no infiltrates and no pneumothorax. He had returned to his
baseline mental status and he was deemed ready for discharge to
the rehabilitation facility , which is owned by his daughter.
On the day of discharge , the patient&apos;s vital signs were
temperature 97.7 degrees , heart rate 65 in sinus rhythm , blood
pressure 104/60 , O2 saturation 97% on room air. Respiratory rate
20. The patient was still several kilograms above his
preoperative weight. A urinalysis had suggested a low-level
infection and his urine culture was growing proteus 5000 CFUs and
he was started on a seven day course of ciprofloxacin.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 143 , potassium
4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 34 , BUN 33 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 102 , magnesium 2.4 , white blood cell count 11.6 ,
hematocrit 28.0 , hemoglobin 9.1 , platelets 297 , 000. PT 16.2 , INR
1.3 , PTT 28.1.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Symptomatic critical aortic stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 56-year-old smoker status post renal transplant in January
of this year complicated by delayed graft function and sepsis who
presented two days prior to admission with shortness of breath
and chest pain. The patient was found to have critical aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2 an EF of 60%. The patient
does have a history of positive stress test for which a cardiac
catheterization was performed in 6/29 .  At that time , he was
found to have 40% lesion of the LAD. On admission to the
Nides Medical Center , on 10/12/05 , cardiac enzymes were drawn and this showed
a troponin level of 0.21. EKG showed no acute changes. The
patient was placed ACS protocol and initially admitted to the
Cardiology Service. The Cardiac Surgery Service was consulted
for emergent aortic valve repair and potential coronary artery
bypass grafting.

Height 6 foot 1 inch and weight 100 kg. Temperature 98.0
degrees , heart rate 82 and sinus , blood pressure right arm
126/60 , blood pressure left arm 130/68 , and oxygen saturation
97%. No carotid bruits , regular rate and rhythm with a loud 4-6
systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border , bilateral
rales. Soft , nontender , and nondistended abdomen. Extremities
with 2+ edema bilaterally. Pulses , 2+ femoral bilaterally.
Pedal pulses are present by Doppler bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:
Admission labs are significant for BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.8 ,
glucose of 203 , white blood cell count of 9660 , hematocrit of
35% , and platelets 269 , 000.
IMAGING:
1. Cardiac catheterization on 1/11/04 performed at Sonprat Health , 40%
proximal LAD lesion , codominant circulation.
2. Echocardiogram on 5/13 , aortic stenosis with mean gradient
62 mmHg , peak gradient of 82 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2 ,
mild aortic insufficiency , trivial mitral insufficiency , LVH EF
of 50%.
3. EKG on 10/21/05 , normal sinus rhythm at 70 with first-degree
AV block , evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
4. Chest x-ray on 10/21/05 , interstitial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 10/17/05 , the patient was brought to the operating room for
critical aortic stenosis , acute coronary syndrome and acute
pulmonary edema. He underwent an aortic valve replacement with a
#21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve , as well as a coronary artery
bypass graft x1 with LIMA to LAD. Bypass time was 120 minutes
and crossclamp time 90 minutes. Two atrial wires and one
ventricular wire was placed. Please see the operative note for
further details. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He
was extubated with without incident on postoperative day #1. His
neurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any delirium
as witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia during
the renal transplantation. He was noted to have significant oral
secretions , but these were clear and thin. On postoperative day
#1 , his femoral arterial line was removed and his renal
transplantation medications restarted. His CK-MB peaked at 46
and did trend down thereafter. On postoperative day #2 , he had
begun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seen
by chest x-ray. His chest tubes were removed without incident.
On postoperative day #3 , he was hemodynamically stable. His FK
levels were noted to be low , as is historically the case with
him. Renal Transplant Medicine was following and did titrated
his medications as necessary. On postoperative day #4 , his final
left chest tube was removed. Post-pull chest x-ray showed the
lung to be well expanded. He was found to be hyponatremic with a
sodium of approximately 130. He was begun on fluid restriction
of 1.5 liters for hematocrit of 21. A 1 unit of packed red blood
cells was also given at this time and he was continued on
diuresis. On postoperative day #5 , as his preoperatively weight
had been reached , he was taken off of diuresis. His renal
transplantation medications discontinue. The patient was up out
of bed and ambulating well. The patient was also noted to have a
large sacral decubitus ulcer , without exposure of bone. This
ulcer was the result of the previous admission in January after
renal transplantation. The Plastic Surgery Service was consulted
and their recommendations included appropriate therapeutic
support surface , frequent turning with minimization of being in
the seated position , optimization of nutrition , and wet-to-dry
dressings to the wound. The service is still following the
patient and will consider VAC dressing and the later time.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEMS:
Neuro: The patient was alert , oriented , and intact. P.r.n.
narcotic pain medications as tolerated. Please avoid NSAIDs and
nephrotoxic drugs for pain control.
Cardiovascular: Lopressor increased to 37.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.. To
be titrated to goal systolic blood pressure of less than 140 and
heart rate in the 70&apos;s. Diltiazem , currently on hold , per Dr.
Grat . Renal Transplant Medicine is aware and in an agreement.
Respiratory: The patient is saturating well on room air. Chest
x-ray with mild pulmonary edema , improving each day. Continue
pulmonary toilet and activity.
GI: On cardiac/renal/ADA diet. Nexium , continued to offer
nutritional supplementation to optimize status in light of wound
healing needs.
Renal: Status post renal transplantation in 5/13 with Renal
Transplant Medicine Service following. The patient currently is
on prednisone , Prograf , CellCept , as directed by the transplant
team. Transplant team will follow and make recommendations. The
patient also was hyponatremia , on 1500 mL fluid restriction at
the time of transfer. Sodium level to be followed.
Endocrine: The patient on NovoLog sliding scale Diabetes

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit after his first operation on 2/3/2004 which was revision
left total hip arthroplasty. It went without complications but
because of his pulmonary hypertension and need for a central line
monitoring he was admitted for the ICU. He did quite well in the
ICU and was discharged the next day to the floor. On the floor
he received pain control , antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours and
was started on Lovenox right away in anticipation of surgery next
week for his right total hip. He mobilized his physical therapy
and did well. There were no signs of infection over the course
of the week or DVT. One week later he went on to a right total
hip replacement which also went without complications but did not
require an ICU stay. Again , he was given antibiotics
perioperatively for 48 hours. His was started on Coumadin the
night of the surgery to maintain an INR of 2-3 for 14 days with
Lovenox which he was given right away and then to maintain an INR
of 3-4 after the initial 14 days postoperatively. He did well
with physical therapy , was getting out of bed. His incisions
were clean , dry and intact bilaterally. The remainder of his

ATTENDING: TAJIMA , BURT MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Urosepsis.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Urosepsis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia.
4. Aspiration.
5. Pulmonary embolism.
6. Diabetes.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Spinal sarcoidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of spinal
sarcoidosis with secondary paraplegia who presented with altered
mental status , hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. He
was doing well until the morning of 4/29/2006 when he complained
of difficulty breathing and his wife placed him on home CPAP
machine that he usually uses at night. Despite being placed on
the machine , he was still having air hunger and complaining of
feeling unwell. His wife also noted him to have increasing
lethargy and decreased responsiveness and called EMS to have him
brought to the emergency room. He also was noted to have a
decreased urine output from his chronic suprapubic catheter x2
days. In the emergency room , he was found to be unresponsive ,
grunting , and in respiratory distress. His initial room air
saturation was in the high 60&apos;s to low 70&apos;s. He was placed on
100% nonrebreather with some improvement of his saturations in
the low 90&apos;s and an ABG of 7.37/43/77 on 100% nonrebreather. He
was therefore intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He
became hypotensive with intubation despite using etomidate with
blood pressures in the 60&apos;s/40&apos;s , and an initial CVP of 16 , so he
was started on Levophed with a systolic blood pressure in the
130&apos;s on 7 to 10 of Levophed. He received 1 liter of IV fluid.
He received a head CT without contrast that showed no acute
bleeding or acute infarction. He had a chest x-ray that showed
no obvious infiltrate. His INR was found to be elevated. Given
the CT of his abdomen without contrast that showed a suprapubic
catheter obstruction with bilateral hydronephrosis and distended
bladder. His creatinine was 2.9 , elevated from his baseline of
0.9. Urology was consulted to change the suprapubic catheter
tube and pus was noted to be aspirated from the suprapubic
catheter. He was started on vancomycin , gentamicin , Flagyl , and
stress dose steroids , and blood and urine cultures were sent in
the emergency and he was transferred to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Sarcoid disease 20 years ago , paraplegia x18 years , chronic
suprapubic catheter/ostomy for 12 years , diabetes type II , right
DVT , on Coumadin , status post chronic UTI , and CPAP at night for
obstructive sleep apnea.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Include Regular Insulin sliding scale a.c. and at bedtime , NPH 54
units in the morning and 68 units in the night , baclofen 10 mg
t.i.d. , amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime , oxybutynin 5 mg t.i.d. ,
gabapentin 300 mg t.i.d. , iron sulfate 325 mg t.i.d. , vitamin C
500 mg daily , magnesium 420 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg daily ,
ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. , and calcium 950 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 97.4 , heart rate 105 , blood pressure 136/67 ,
his O2 saturation was 100% on AC 700 with PEEP of 5. In general ,
he was intubated and responsive to simple commands. HEENT:
Sluggish pupils. His lungs were clear anteriorly. His heart was
in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. His
abdomen was obese , large , soft , nondistended and nontender , with
positive bowel sounds. His extremities had chronic venous stasis
changes of right and lower extremities with areas of no skin
breakdown. He had a large sacral decubitus ulcer with bone
exposed that was foul smelling on his sacrum. He was
neurologically moving all four extremities and following
commands. He had an ostomy and suprapubic catheter in place.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Notable for an elevated creatinine of 2.9 , otherwise , his Chem-7
was within normal limits. His LFTs were within normal limits.
His hematocrit was 34.6 , his white count was 9.4 , and his
platelets were 343 , 000. He had negative cardiac enzymes. His
urine and blood tox screens were negative. His UA was
significant for 3+ protein , trace glucose , negative ketones , 3+
leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4-10 red blood cells , 4+
bacteria , and 3+ triple phosphate crystals. His EKG was in
normal sinus rhythm with an old right bundle-branch block and
left axis deviation , first-degree AV block. His chest x-ray
showed retrocardiac opacity that was thought to be aspiration
versus pneumonia. Abdominal and chest CT showed bibasilar
airspace opacities , left greater than right , with aspiration
versus pneumonia , bilateral hydronephrosis , severe decubitus
ulcers , and large gastrohepatic lymph nodes slightly enlarged and
calcified.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a 66-year-old man with spinal sarcoidosis and secondary
paraplegia , who presented with altered mental status , hypoxemic
respiratory failure , and hypotension , who had urosepsis and
pneumonia and found later on admission to have pulmonary
embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hypoxemia: He was intubated at the time of admission and
extubated a day later on 5/7/2006. BiPAP was used at night as
he had used at home for a sleep apnea with O2 saturations in the
high 90&apos;s on room air during the day. He was initially treated
for pneumonia with ceftazidime , levofloxacin , and vancomycin.
The vancomycin was discontinued on 3/18/2006 , and the
ceftazidime was discontinued on 10/8/206. His levofloxacin was
continued at 500 mg per day for a total 10-day course on
5/3/2006. This is to be used for a UTI and pneumonia. On
11/8/2006 , the patient was supposed to go home and found to have
a desaturation to high 80&apos;s on room air. He was found to have a
chest x-ray within normal limits. A pulmonary embolism CT was
done that demonstrated a small nonocclusive pulmonary embolism in
the posterobasilar segment of the right lower lobe with involving
right lower lobe infarct suggestive that he had had a PE that was
resolving. At this time , his INR had been subtherapeutic for
three days at 1.7 to 1.9 and he was continued on his Coumadin.
The following day , his INR was therapeutic at 2 , and on the day
of discharge , it was 2.2. It was thought that the PE was in the
setting of a subtherapeutic INR. His oxygen requirement was back
to baseline at the time of discharge , and his goal INR was to be
on the higher end of the 2 to 3 range , which was goal previously.
He was also given nebulizer treatments throughout his
hospitalization.
2. ID: His urine was found to have Proteus , resistant to
Macrobid , and Klebsiella , resistant to ampicillin. Levofloxacin
was started for this and for the presumed pneumonia seen on chest
x-ray for a total of a 10-day course. Sputum and blood cultures
have been no growth to date. He had no fevers and no elevated
white counts.
3. Cardiac: He was thought to have an element of autonomic
insufficiency secondary to sarcoid with episodes of hypo and
hypertension in the MICU. His cortisol stim test was within
normal limits , it was 14.5 before stim and 23.6 after stim , so he
was not treated with steroids. His blood pressure was in the
30&apos;s to 160&apos;s with pauses in the 100&apos;s on the floor with frequent
bigeminy and trigeminy and many PVCs , so he was started on 12.5
b.i.d. metoprolol on 7/6/2006 with good results. He continued
to have ectopy and continued to be hypertensive , and given his
diabetes , he was started on a low dose of captopril on 6/20/2006
with no complications and was able to maintain blood pressures in
ideal ranges.
4. GU: Urology replaces suprapubic catheter early on admission.
He was continued to have bladder irrigation with good effect ,
and Urology signed off on 7/13/2007.
5. Endocrine: The patient was given NPH 20 b.i.d. through his
hospitalization and Regular Insulin sliding scale. His sugars
were high on this reduced regimen and so he was placed on his
home NPH doses for discharge.
6. Decubitus ulcer: Plastic Surgery was consulted on 4/29/2006
and the wound did not look infected. It was debrided and
wet-to-dry t.i.d. dressing changes were recommended as well as
Panafil t.i.d. dressing changes. He was prescribed Panafil to go
home on.
7. Renal: The creatinine was initially 2.7 , and after receiving
IV fluids , it came down to 1.2. He likely had acute renal
failure secondary to postrenal obstructive etiology. His
creatinine was stable at around 1 for the remainder of his
admission.
8. Heme: The patient has a history of DVT. Initially , his INR
was found to be therapeutic and he was placed on levofloxacin , so
the plan was that he should have half of his home Coumadin dose
while he was on levofloxacin , so he was given half of dose and
his INRs came down to a nadir of 1.7. His INR was subtherapeutic
for three days , and at that time , a PE was found , his INR was
1.8. The day after this , his INR was 2 and then came up to 2.2
on the day of discharge. He was discharged on Coumadin 5 mg ,
which is his home dose to follow up at his Coumadin Clinic.
9. FEN: He was placed on maintenance IV fluids until cleared to
eat by Speech and Swallow. Speech and Swallow estimates having
baseline aspiration risk and he was known to cough and aspirate
at home. He had been recently worked up at the A County Medical Center
on a recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. They recommended
thickened puree diets and felt that even this he was likely to
aspirate. The risks and benefits of eating were explained to his
wife and him and he decided to continue to eat as there was no
ideal option.
10. Pain: He continued gabapentin , oxybutynin , and
amitriptyline as at home.
11. Prophylaxis: He was given Nexium and Coumadin.
12. Code status: He was full code , which was discussed with his
wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The current temperature was 98 , the heart rate was 91 to 114 ,
blood pressure 100-114/54-70 , respiratory rate of 20 , and
saturating 97-100% on 1-2 liters. In general , he was responsive ,
alert , and appropriate. His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. His heart had normal S1 and S2 , soft systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. His abdomen
had positive bowel sounds , distended , soft and nontender. He had
a suprapubic catheter as well as an ostomy that were clean , dry
and intact. Extremities , he had 2+ peripheral edema that was
stable with no skin breakdown.
LABORATORY VALUES:
His labs at the time of discharge were stable. His hematocrit
was 27.2 , down from 29 , which was closed to his baseline of 34.
His INR was 2.1 at the time discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime , vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily ,
baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Caltrate 600 Plus D one tablet p.o.
b.i.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , gabapentin 300 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , NPH human insulin 54 units in the morning , 68 units
in the evening , Regular Insulin sliding scale , levofloxacin 500
mg p.o. daily , to end on 11/23/2006 for a total course of 10
days , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Panafil ointment t.i.d. ,
ranitidine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient will follow up his PCP , Dr. Dunstan The appointment
with Dr. Carros will be within the next week , and the
appointment with the Coumadin Clinic will be tomorrow or the next
day.
ISSUES FOR FOLLOW UP:
Include following up on his aspiration risk and continuing to
discourage thin liquids as well as encourage him sitting upright
when eating and being observed and stopping when he coughs. He
will need continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring
given the new beta-blocker and the ACE inhibitor as well as
assessment of his frequent PVCs. We will continue to follow his
diabetes and continue to follow his INR with a goal being 2 to 3
with ideal goal on the higher end 8 range.

There was no hematuria. There was no hemoptysis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a middle-aged white female
who was lying in bed in mildly acute
distress. The temperature was 98.1 degrees. The blood pressure
was 150/75 at the Emergency Department , but it was only 90/60 when
measured on the floor. The pulse rate was 72. The respiratory
rate was 18. The oxygen saturation was 97% on two liters. The
conjunctiva were pale. The sclera were icteric. The pupils had

abdomen was soft and was slightly distended. The liver and the
spleen were not palpable. The bowel sounds were normo-active. The
extremities were freely moveable. There was mild pitting edema.
There was no cyanosis , and there was no clubbing of fingers. The
Homans&apos; sign was negative. There was no palpable cord of the legs.
The left calf was slightly tender , but the dorsalis pedis pulse was
positive on both sides , although slightly less on the left side

A chest x-ray revealed no cardiomegaly and no pulmonary congestion.
An EKG originally showed normal sinus , with no acute ST-T changes.
The ABGs with two liters oxygen showed a PO2 of 74.0 , an SO2 of
94.4 , a pH of 7.37 , a PCO2 of 39.0.
Other studies included a cardiac echo which showed normal left
ventricular size and normal systolic function. The ejection
fraction was 54%. There was normal right ventricular size and
function. There was no acute right heart overload. There was no
significant valvular dysfunction , and there was no pericardial
effusion. The V-Q scan on April , showed intermediate
probability for PE. The cardiac catheterization on April ,

Leni&apos;s studies on April showed no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis. A pulmonary angiogram on August showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE: After the patient was admitted to the Floor , she
developed hypotension , with the blood pressure
Pdown to 80/50. The hypotension was responsive to normal saline
challenge , 2.0 liters. The arterial blood gases showed a large AO2
gradient. After three hours on the Floor , the EKG showed Q-R-S and
ST-T changes at Lead 3 and AVF , suggestive of right ventricular
strain , so right ventricular infarction was suspected. Emergency
cardiac echo showed that there was no acute right heart overload ,
and that both chambers of the heart were normal. Cardiac
catheterization was normal. Leni&apos;s showed no evidence of deep
venous thrombosis. A pulmonary angiogram was done , and it showed
no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Other causes of epigastric pain
such as pancreatitis and hepatitis was ruled out because of normal
levels of amylase , lipase and liver function. The patient&apos;s chest
pain was partially relieved with Motrin.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Initial postoperative period: Rufus Leanard was
extubated without difficulty and had reasonable saturations on
nasal cannula. Chest x-ray appeared wet and diuresis was
increased. The history of COPD and thus preoperative COPD
medications were restarted. She was in sinus rhythm with a
systolic blood pressure of 110 and started on beta-blocker. She
was given Toradol initially for pain and Percocet for break
through pain. Gentle diuresis was initiated and in the initial
postoperative period she was on the Portland protocol for
elevated postoperative blood sugars. She was transferred to the

Diuresis was continued and increased as needed. She was on 96%
saturation with 3 liters of oxygen delivered via nasal cannula.
Her hematocrit postoperative fluctuated between 23-25 and the
patient was asymptomatic. She continued to be followed by
cardiology for the duration of her hospital course. Gentle
ambulation was increased. She remained in sinus rhythm in the
80&apos;s and pressure was stable 120&apos;s/80&apos;s and oxygen was
progressively weaned. Her temporary pacing wires were DC&apos;d
without incident on 1/19/04. She was followed by Diabetes
Management Service for the duration of her hospital course.
Chest tubes were DC&apos;d without incident on 6/26/04. Physical
therapy was consulted and they cleared her for home discharge
secondary to elevated white count and low-grade temperatures on

820826215 | CCH | 98532506 | | 8876870 | 9/18/2003 12:00:00 AM | ISCHEMIC HEART FAILURE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 5/2/2003 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 7/15/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 72-year-old woman
with ischemic cardiomyopathy status
post CABG in 1995 who presented with palpitations. The patient
said her symptoms developed about a month ago. She has had stress
for the last few months. Her husband died six months ago from
pancreatic cancer. When her palpitations developed she assumed
that they were related to anxiety. She said that she would feel a
rapid heart rate that would last about thirty minutes at a time and
occurred several times a week. She denied any chest pain or
syncope with these episodes. She presented to cardiology clinic to
see Dr. Hupp where an electrocardiogram was done and she was found
to have a heart rate of 162. Her blood pressure at that time was
100/60. She was admitted to the cardiology service for further
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) in April ,
1995. Vessels bypassed were the LIMA/LAD , SVG/PDA. Her CABG was
preceded by her first MI in October 1995 where she was found to
have stenosis in her stenosis in her LAD , RCA. She had PCI to both
vessels in the intervening period. She had unstable angina and was
recathed which showed restenosis leading up to her CABG. Her last
echocardiogram was in September , 2001 that showed an ejection fraction of
20%. 2. Type 2 diabetes which is complicated by peripheral
neuropathy. 3. Hypertension. 4. Gout. 5. Anxiety and
depression.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Pravachol 10 mg p.o.q.d.; Elavil 20 mg
p.o. once a day; allopurinol 3 x week;
Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day; Accupril 10 mg
once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a day; Xanax t.i.d. p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s husband died six months ago of
pancreatic cancer. He was a retired Cho S Ache
policeman. She has a long history of heavy smoking but is not
currently smoking. She denies any alcohol use. She lives alone on
the E Lane , Ma , Arizona 97322 but has a daughter who lives in Cosa Lare Stin
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate
104 , blood pressure 100/60 , satting 96% on
room air , breathing 18. GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.
HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Pupils equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation. JVP flat at 45 degrees.
CARDIOVASCULAR: She had a laterally displaced PMI , normal S1 ,
split S2. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:
Lower extremities were warm with 1+ edema bilaterally. NEURO:
Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with left
atrial enlargement and left bundle branch block. Her
electrocardiogram in clinic showed a wide complex tachycardia and a
left bundle branch block. Her chest x-ray showed no pulmonary
edema or infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This patient is a 72-year-old woman with a
significant ischemic heart disease who was
admitted with wide complex tachycardia.
1 ) Cardiovascular - Ischemia: The patient&apos;s abnormal rhythm was
presumed to be ventricular tachycardia given her history of severe
ischemic heart disease. Once her tachycardia was stabilized she
was taken to catheterization which showed patent grafts. She did
have a small increase in her troponin but this was thought to be
related to demand. She did not have any complaints of chest pain
during the hospitalization. We continued her on her beta blocker
and initially held her digoxin while we were controlling her
rhythm. She was slightly hypotensive during her episodes of
tachycardia so we initially held her Accupril as well , but her
medications were resumed a few days before discharge.
Pump: At the time of admission the patient was classified as
having Class II heart failure although she did admit to not being
very active and it was felt that if the patient exerted herself
more she would have more symptoms. On her catheterization her
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was found to be 31 with a normal
right atrial pressure. She also had a repeat echocardiogram which
showed an ejection fraction of 15% with 1+ MR and a thick aortic
and mitral valve. She did not exhibit any signs of volume overload
during her hospitalization and we continued her home dose of Lasix.
We also kept her on a two liter fluid restriction but her
creatinine soon began to increase from a baseline level of 1.4 to a
peak of 2.1. The patient did admit that she drank a significantly
larger amount of fluid at home and so she was quite hypovolemic in
comparison to what she was normally used to. As a result we
liberalized her fluid restriction and her creatinine normalized.
Rhythm: When the patient arrived her tachycardia resolved and she
was in normal sinus rhythm. However , later that evening she went
back into ventricular tachycardia. She had stayed in ventricular
tachycardia with her heart rate often reaching the 130s for several
minutes at a time. Her blood pressure was always stable in the
90s/50s. She denied any chest pain. She was given an amiodarone
load of 150 mg IV x 1 over 20 minutes and also started on a p.o.
load of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. Over the next two days she continued to
have episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia for five minutes
at a time and ultimately her ventricular tachycardia progressed so
that she would have episodes of 10-15 minutes at a time. When she
became symptomatic she was started on an amiodarone drip. This was
done through a peripheral line and after several hours the patient
developed a mild phlebitis. She was taken off the drip and placed
again on p.o. amiodarone. Her VTAC was thought to be primarily due
to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discussed the need for an ICD
with her. She was reluctant but ultimately agreed. We did also
discuss the possibility of an EP study and ablation but the patient
preferred the least invasive method possible. While the patient
was currently in compensated heart failure , as mentioned previously
it was felt that this was because she did not exert herself any
further , and that it was likely that she would within the next year
or two , decompensate and have more symptoms of congestive heart
failure. Because of the severity of her disease a dual-chamber
pacemaker was also placed at the same time as the ICD. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. By the time of discharge her
amiodarone was decreased to 200 b.i.d. This will likely be
decreased to 200 q.d. as an outpatient. She did not have any more
episodes of VTAC.
2 ) Endocrinology: We kept the patient on her same insulin regimen
of 60 units in the morning and in the evening and covered her with
an insulin sliding scale.
3 ) Pulmonary: The patient will have pulmonary function tests as
an outpatient given her therapy with amiodarone. At baseline she
did not have any pulmonary complaints.
4 ) ID: When the patient was given IV amiodarone she did develop
phlebitis. Despite the fact that the amiodarone was quickly
discontinued , she did develop what appeared to be a mild
cellulitis. She was started on Keflex and her cellulitis resolved.
During the hospitalization she also had a urinary tract infection
with E. coli. We were limited in the antibiotics that we could
choose. We did not want to use levofloxacin because of the
potential to prolong her QT given that she was taking amiodarone
and Elavil. She had an allergy to Bactrim which had a reported
history of renal failure. We were not able to find out any more
details on this reaction. As a result we gave her a seven-day
course of cefpodoxime given that the UTI was speciated to E. coli.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient has a history of gout. We continued
her allopurinol.
DISPOSITION: The patient was sent home with her daughter. We did
offer for her to have VNA but she refused and felt
that her needs would be met at her daughter&apos;s house. At the time
of discharge she was not sure whether she was going to move back to
her home eventually in the Ba or whether she was going to
sell her home and move closer to family.
FOLLOWUP: The patient has follow up appointments with Dr. Stuber
and Dr. Buhr She will have pulmonary function tests.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pravachol 10 mg p.o. once a day; Elavil 20
mg p.o.q.d.; NPH 60 mg q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
allopurinol 300 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday; Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.
once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day;
Accupril 10 mg once a day; digoxin 0.0625 once a day; amiodarone
200 mg twice a day; Keflex 250 mg p.o. x 2 doses; cefpodoxime 100
mg p.o.q.d. x 2 days. Please note that we decreased the patient&apos;s
digoxin dose from 0.125 to 0.0625 given the addition of amiodarone.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Mechanical fall.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Bradycardia.
3. Osteoarthritis , status post left total knee replacement.
4. Spinal stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Navarrate is a 73-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
dyslipidemia , and arthritis who presents with a fall. The
patient has a history of pulmonary embolism in 2000 , treated with
Lovenox and Coumadin. The patient also has a history of coronary
artery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction. She presented with chest pain in 2001 and had a
troponin I , which peaked at 25. Cardiac catheterization revealed
a left-sided occlusion and percutaneous coronary intervention was
unsuccessful. A subsequent adenosine mibi in September 2002
revealed normal left ventricular function and no perfusion
defects. The patient has since been admitted for left chest
pain , last in February 2005 , which has been attributed to her
shoulder arthritis. She ruled out for myocardial infarction at
that time and chest CT scans were also negative. Today , the
patient was talking to her son on the phone when she went to
retrieve a pen and her left knee gave out and she suffered a
mechanical fall to the floor. She struck her left forehead
against a dresser. She did not have any loss of consciousness
and also denied chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations.
There were no focal neurological deficits and no actively
inflamed joints. She says that her left lower extremity ,
especially her left knee is chronically unstable and weak. In
the emergency department , the patient was afebrile. Her heart
rate was 70. Her systolic blood pressure was initially 190 mmHg ,
but subsequently came down to 150 mmHg without any intervention.
A head CT was negative for bleed and a chest x-ray was negative
for infiltrate or effusions. She was admitted to Medicine for
further evaluation.

exam , the patient was lying in bed in no apparent distress and
was alert and oriented. The extraocular movements were intact.
There is no scleral icterus with a mild proptosis and some
periorbital induration around her right eye , which was tender to
palpation. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. The
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. On her cardiac
exam , the patient had a regular rate and rhythm , a normal S1 with
physiological split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur , best heard at
the base. Abdomen was soft and nontender , with active bowel
sounds. The patient&apos;s extremities were warm and well perfused
without edema. On strength testing , the patient had 4/5 strength
in her left knee extensors and left hip flexors; otherwise , all
other muscle groups in her lower extremities were 5/5. The
patient reports that her left lower extremity weakness is
chronic. There were no effusions on either knee. Skin was
without rashes.
INITIAL LABORATORY DATA: Her sodium was 143 , potassium 3.4 ,
chloride 107 , bicarb 28 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 , with glucose of
160. The patient had a white blood cell count of 5300 ,

and a PTT was 27.8. The patient&apos;s initial CK was 177 , CK-MB was
3.7 , and troponin I was less than assay. An EKG showed sinus
bradycardia with normal axes and no T-wave changes , no Q waves ,
and no ST changes. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary
process and a head CT was negative for mass or bleed.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted due to a mechanical
fall and ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial CKs and
troponins drawn 8 hours apart for three sets. Her EKGs remained
unchanged throughout her hospitalization and the patient had no
chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other cardiac symptoms.
Her troponin values were all less than assay. The patient
ambulated with PT the morning after her admission without
difficulty , navigating stairs , and also walking around the pond
without any difficulty whatsoever. The patient also had plain
films taken of her left knee , which showed that her left knee
prosthesis was well seated without any evidence of instability or
fusion or fracture of the joint. The patient was noted during
her hospitalization to be bradycardiac to the mid 40s while
sleeping. It was recommended that the patient follow up with the
primary care physician to assess whether she needs to continue on
her atenolol due to bradycardia noted on telemetry. The patient
will also follow up with her orthopedist regarding her proceed
instability of her left knee joint. The patient&apos;s orthopedist is
Dr. Fickett of the Pa Memorial Hospital and her primary care
physician is Dr. Mcbrearty in Vill Medical Center The patient will call
for follow-up appointment with her physicians. The patient was
discharged with her son to home on the evening of 8/19/06 to
continue her admission medications. There were no changes made
to her medications listed above.

Discharge Date: 10/17/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: NECK PAIN.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK ON ELECTROCARDIOGRAM.
2. NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
5. CHRONIC NECK PAIN.
6. IMPOTENCE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Tijerino is a 63-year-old man with a
history of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and chronic neck and shoulder pain
who presented with a near syncopal episode and a new left bundle
branch block on EKG. He has a history of intermittent episodes of
sudden onset of an ill defined , non-painful sensation that shoots
from the region of his left shoulder , up his left neck , and then
across his head bilaterally. The episodes are usually
instantaneous. He does not know how often he has them , but does
not think that he has had more of these episodes recently. He has
previously been worked up for chronic neck and left shoulder pain
that is attributed , in part , to a history of trauma. X-rays have
shown degenerative arthritis in the cervical spine , especially in
the region of C6 and C7 with evidence of foraminal narrowing and
nerve root impingement. He also has evidence of multiple
osteophytes in his cervical spine and in the region of his left
shoulder. He has had a normal head CT in 7/17 This pain has
been responsive to physical therapy and traction in the past.
Today , he had a similar such episode while turning his head to the
right while driving his car. The shooting sensation from his
shoulder up to his head was accompanied by a near loss of
consciousness and was followed immediately by flushing with
diaphoresis and then weakness and dizziness that persisted for
about 5-10 minutes. He did feel nauseated , but did not vomit. He
denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations. He
pulled his car over to the side of the road and had his friend
drive him to TTFC. He continued to feel weak. He was noted at
TFHC to have a left bundle branch block on his EKG that was new
compared to an EKG obtained in 8/3 He was , therefore , referred
to Mibo Hospital for further evaluation and
management. On system review , he gives a history of dyspnea on
exertion and exertional fatigue with shortness of breath that is
relieved by rest. This has not changed recently and seems stable.
He also had stable three pillow orthopnea. He denied any
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or swelling of lower extremities. His
cardiac risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a
positive family history , hypercholesterolemia , and he is a former
smoker.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed in 1992 , last glycosylated
hemoglobin was was 12.7 in 6/18 2. Possible coronary artery
disease , last exercise tolerance test in 6/10 was without any
evidence of EKG changes. 3. Hypertension diagnosed in 1992. 4.
Hypercholesterolemia with baseline cholesterol 251 , LDL 175 , HDL
32 , and triglycerides 262. 5. Chronic neck and left shoulder pain
as above. 6. History of headaches , possible migraine headache
versus cluster headaches. 7. Probable gastroesophageal reflux
disease by history. 8. History of a right sided pneumonia and
empyema status post right sided chest tube four weeks , now with
chronic pleural changes. 9. Benign prostatic hypertrophy , last PSA
was 2.88 in 3/22 10. Impotence , normal prolactin and
testosterone levels. 11. History of balanitis. 12. History of
psoriasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.day. 2.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.
Aspirin. 4. Terazosin 2 mg p.o. q.day. 5. Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. 6. Ativan p.r.n. 7. Percocet p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease in his
father who died of a myocardial infarction at age
66. There is no family history of diabetes mellitus or
hypertension.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired custodian. His wife died
in the last year , just after having undergone a
coronary arterial bypass graft. He has three children who lives in
the area. He claims he quit smoking in 1990 after a 40 pack year
history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature was 98.5 , heart rate between
90 and 100 , blood pressure 144/96 ,
respiratory rate 16 , and oxygen saturation 95% on two liters by
nasal cannula. He appeared to be a middle aged man who was
comfortable lying in bed. HEENT examination was notable for a 5 mm
nodule on the palpebral margin of his right upper eyelid. Sclera
were anicteric. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles were intact. Oropharynx was without any
evidence of lesions or without any adenopathy or masses. There was
no jugular venous distention apparent and no bruits heard. His
neck was nontender to palpation. His back was nontender to
palpation. No muscle spasm was palpable. His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate sounded somewhat fast ,
but was regular. His heart sounds were distant with an indistinct
first heart sound , but a second heart sound without evidence of
splitting. No S3 was heard. There was a question of a fourth
heart sound. There was also question of a grade I/VI systolic
murmur at the left sternal border and apex. He had good radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses. His abdomen appeared obese with active
bowel sounds. It was soft and nontender. His liver span was
estimated at 6 cm by percussion. He did not have any splenomegaly.
His stool was heme occult negative. Extremities were without any
evidence of cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. His skin was warm and
moist without any lesions. Neurologic examination showed an alert
and oriented man with fluent speech and 5/5 motor strength in his
upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. His touch
sensation was intact in his lower extremities bilaterally. He had
normal biceps and patellar deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. His
toes were downgoing on Babinski&apos;s test bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits with BUN
24 and creatinine 1.2. Serum glucose was 204.
His white blood cell count was 7 , 900 , hematocrit 42% , and platelets
282 , 000. His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times
were normal. His liver function tests were normal. His
cholesterol was 227 with triglycerides 311. His cardiac troponin
was 0.0. EKG , on admission , showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 30
with the left bundle branch pattern that was new compared with an
EKG from 8/3 His axis and intervals were normal. A chest x-ray
demonstrated a right lower lobe opacity and bilateral pleural
thickening , no acute infiltrate , and no evidence of congestive
heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The etiology of his symptoms was unclear , but he
was admitted to rule out myocardial infarction ,
given the fact that he had a left bundle branch block pattern on
his EKG that was new compared to a previous EKG. It was not known
whether this new EKG finding was acute or whether this had occurred
sometime between 3/16 and the present time. He was started on
heparin for the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. He
was maintained on aspirin and started on a beta blocker. His
hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. He was started on
simvastatin given his hypercholesterolemia. He ruled out for an
acute myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes. He had an
echocardiogram on 2/9/96 which demonstrated borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy with low normal systolic function and an
estimated ejection fraction of 45%-50%. No regional wall motion
abnormalities were noted. He had mild left atrial enlargement ,
mild mitral regurgitation , and mild tricuspid regurgitation. A
Holter monitor on 2/9/96 showed a predominant rhythm of normal
sinus rhythm with a few atrial premature beats and ventricular
premature contractions. There was no evidence of high grade
ventricular ectopy. Because of his uninterpretable EKG , he
underwent exercise testing with MIBI imaging on 3/2/96. He
exercised for 6 minutes on a standard Bruce protocol. This was
discontinued due to fatigue. His heart rate increased from
baseline 58 to a peak of 94 , and his blood pressure changed from
130/60 at rest to 140/50 at peak. His peak rate pressure product
was 13 , 200. His EKG was notable for left bundle branch pattern
with 1 mm ST depressions. MIBI imaging demonstrated small apical
and septal rift consistent with mild ischemia. Because he remained
asymptomatic , and because his exercise test was without evidence of
large areas of myocardium at risk , he was discharged home on
3/2/96. He will follow up with his cardiologist for further
evaluation as indicated. His medication regimen was optimized
during his hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day. 2. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day. 3.
Hytrin 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. 4. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 5 mg
p.o. q.h.s. 5. Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6. Simvastatin 10 mg
p.o. q.day. 7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually q.5 minutes as
needed for chest pain.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: He was discharged home on a low
cholesterol , low saturated fat diet.
FOLLOW-UP: He will follow up with his primary physician and
cardiologist in the next week.

Discharge Date: 8/26/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73 year old white female with
hereditary angioedema with recent
abdominal surgery presents with 30 hours of severe abdominal pain
and tightness , typical of her hereditary angioedema attacks. The
patient has had HAE since childhood and recalls having a ring cut
off her finger as a child during an attack. She has had three
tracheostomies , the last one over 20 years ago for laryngeal edema.
Symptoms include throat tightness , difficulty talking and
swallowing and abdominal pain. She often has attacks at local
trauma sites. Over the past several years she has received Human
C1 esterase inhibitor as part of a study conducted at CTMC by Dr.
Benjamin Gendusa She has done very well with these treatments for acute
attacks until recently when she states the inhibitor has stopped
working as well as previously. Dr. Greg Toomsen has told her she
may have an antibody to the inhibitor and her recent events include
4/17 admitted with severe abdominal pain , flare of HAE , apparently
became hypotensive and acidemic and went to laparotomy emergently ,
on pressors without bowel preparation. Colostomy was done for bowel
wall edema and was complicated by postoperative abscess requiring
drainage. One month ago she had her colostomy taken down which has
been complicated by incontinence of stool requiring Depends. At
baseline , C4 is 6-10 , normal being 16-34 , C1 inhibitor 5-9 , normal
being 25-83. On 8/20/95 at 1:30 p.m. she developed the onset of
typical HAE attack with crescendo abdominal pain and throat
tightness. She took extra stanozolol but the abdominal pain
persisted to where it was intolerable and she presented to the EW
with nausea and vomiting. Last bowel movement was 8/20/95 ,
slightly loose , normal urine. In the EW she was given Demerol ,
Solu Medrol , Zantac and Benadryl. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes
cholecystectomy , appendectomy , hysterectomy for fibroid , but not
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She has a history of renal
calculi , history of abnormal liver function tests , unknown cause ,
history of AF , now controlled with DIG and Verapamil. She is
status post subdural hematoma on Coumadin at therapeutic levels ,
hypothyroid on replacement , history of right deep venous
thrombosis , history of carpal tunnel syndrome , severe
osteoarthritis with cervical spine , lumbosacral spine and right
knee involvement. History of cerebrovascular accident , right
hemiparesis , now at 90% of baseline , left iridectomy , left drop
foot , left thigh numbness and tingling , dizziness and
disequilibrium. FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: She has a son and two
grandchildren with HAE , three daughterse not effected , lives with
husband , daughter , lives upstairs. She uses no tobacco , rare ETOH.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin .125 mg q day , Verapamil 60 mg b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 1 mg q day , aspirin 80 mg q day , Synthroid 0.05 mg q day ,
Stanozolol 2 mg q day with increased dose as needed. ALLERGIES:
Quinidine causes nausea; IV contrast causes rash; propafenone ,
migraines; penicillin rash; sulfa rash; novocaine throat swelling.
Food allergies are wheat , dairy , chocolate , walnuts and
strawberries.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission this is an ill-appearing woman
with a raspy voice. Vital signs , 99.1 , heart
rate 116 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 132/84 , respiratory
rate 18. Head and neck examination , normocephalic , atraumatic ,
status post iridectomy on left. The oropharynx is clear , no
stridor. Neck , supple , carotids 2+ , stigmata of old thyroid
tracheostomy. Lungs , clear to auscultation. Heart , irregularly
irregular , tachycardia , I/VI early systolic murmur at left lower
sternal border without radiation. Abdomen , recent midline incision ,
healing , normal bowel sounds , soft but exquisitely tender to
palpation or percussion. There is positive rebound tenderness ,
positive shake tenderness. Rectal , guaiac positive per EW.
Extremities , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema , pulses are 2+
peripherally. She has positive pain to passive motion right knee ,
neck not examined. Neuro , alert and oriented x 3 , cranial nerves
are intact. Motor is 5/5 throughout except left foot without
extension. Sensory , decreased light touch on the left lateral
thigh , deep tendon reflexes 2+ throughout , toes right upgoing , left
downgoing.
LABORATORY DATA: White count 10.2 , hematocrit 41.3 , platelets
377 , sodium 140 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 100 ,
bicarb 30 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose 140 , liver function
tests normal. PT 13.5 , PTT 24.5. Chest x-ray and KUB without
infiltrates , no free air , no ileus , no obstruction. EKG , atrial
fibrillation at 117 , normal QRS and QT , unchanged from 10/10 , DIG
effect is present.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient improved dramatically over the first
day of admission with decreased abdominal pain ,
improving appetite and was started on clear liquids on 3/5/95 late
in the day. Initial treatment included Solu Medrol 125 mg IV bolus
in the emergency room and Stanozolol 2 mg q.i.d. when first sent to
the floor. She also had IV Zantac 50 mg q8 for the first three days
of admission. The patient&apos;s symptoms continued to improve and diet
was advanced over the next several days. Further concerns on this
hospitalization were whether or not she would ever be a candidate
for further C1 esterase inhibitor replacement , the question being
was her hypotension during the last treatment leading to bowel
surgery caused by the disease itself or as a response to the
inhibitor. As of discharge this question has yet to be settled with
Dr. Juengling The patient developed left pedal edema by 10/6/95 and
although on low dose Coumadin , note is made of past subdurals on
therapeutic Coumadin. The patient had a lower extremity noninvasive
revealing a left leg deep venous thrombosis located at the
bifurcation of the left common and superficial femorals. Given the
patient&apos;s complications on Coumadin in the past and risk of
pulmonary embolus , she was sent for filter placement which was done
on 2/14/95. The patient also had the complication of bright red
blood per rectum , she said this happens occasionally at home and on
examination had moderate external hemorrhoids , no sign of recent
bleeding , no internal hemorrhoids , no gross blood on examination.
At this point she had normal coagulation studies and her hematocrit
was 29.8 on 10/26/95. The patient was kept overnight with stable
hematocrit and discharged on 11/7/95.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day; Digoxin .125 mg p.o. q day;
Synthroid 50 micrograms p.o. q day; Verapamil 60 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q day; Stanozolol 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient
will followup by telephone with Dr. Rosario Manoso CONDITION ON
DISCHARGE: Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Deceased.
SERVICE: The patient has been admitted to the renal PA service.
Throughout the patient&apos;s hospital course , the patient had
multiple consults including Hematology , Infectious Disease ,
Nutrition , Physical Therapy , Social Work , and Cardiology.
CHIEF COMPLAINT ON ADMISSION: Epistaxis , melena , shortness of
breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 53-year-old white
female. The recent renal transplant highly sensitized the
patient who was undergoing plasmapheresis for antibody mediated
projection. The patient had a history of rheumatic heart
disease , status post AVR , MVR with St. Jude valve. She had
initially presented with three days of epistaxis , black tarry
stools , and shortness of breath in the setting of the
subtherapeutic INR. Her hematocrit upon admission was 14 , but
she was hemodynamically stable with tremendously elevated
troponin. Her recent hospital course had been complicated by
episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter with RVR ,
gram-positive cocci bacteremia and hypertension , positive for
bacteriemia and endocarditis. The patient had a long course in
the medical intensive care unit following admission.
MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER: Vancomycin 1 g IV q.12 h. start date
of 7/6 , levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.48 h. start date of 7/6 ,

Valcyte 450 mg p.o. q. week. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily , rifampin ,
which was discontinued on 1/26/06 and changed to rifabutin 300
mg daily on 4/10/06.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , pulse 97 ,
BP 109/51 , respirations in the 20s , oxygen saturations in the 98%
on 2L. Generally , she was in no acute distress and alert.
HEENT , JVP increased to 9 cm. Pulmonary , bilateral rales to
bases. Cor , regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Abdomen ,
moderate , distended , but nontender. Good bowel sounds.
Extremities , 2+ edema bilaterally. Neurologically , moved all
extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Anemia. The patient&apos;s hematocrit on admission was 14 in the
setting of subtherapeutic INR , on Coumadin. Her epistaxis now
has resolved and now with a stable hematocrit of greater than 30 ,
status post 7 units packed red blood cells. ENT was consulted
for epistaxis.
2. Fluid collection in the abdomen. The patient had IR guided
drainage of fluid collection done on 4/23 continued to drain
greater than 700 mL per day. She had a repeat CAT scan on
2/13/06 , which indicated large amount of ascites in the abdomen
and pelvis. Fluid pockets where IR drain was placed were no
longer present. IR drain was planned to be removed by CIS.
3. Melena. Upper endoscopy was consisted with evidence of small
shallow pyloric ulcers. No evidence of bleeding source. The
patient was advanced to a full diet and was placed on a proton
pump inhibitor and H. pylori were found.
4. CVS.
a. Elevated troponin , history of hypertension , no known coronary
artery disease , no chest pain , but does have dyspnea on exertion
likely secondary to severe anemia , demand ischemia ,
ST-depressions on EKG since with the demand ischemia. This
patient&apos;s serial troponins had been trending downward with
aggressive rate control. She had a second episode of atrial
fibrillation over the weekend of 11/20/06. The patient had an
episode which was converted with amiodarone. The patient had
elevated troponins that as stated above were turning down and
some ST-depressions on EKG , which was most likely secondary to
demand ischemia. The patient had an echocardiogram while
inhouse , which showed normal left ventricular function. No
regional wall motion abnormalities.
b. AVR , MVR. Heparin was stopped for therapeutic INR on
Coumadin.
c. Endocarditis. TEE. The patient had a transesophageal
echocardiogram which was consistent with small vegetation on the
aortic valve. She was placed on IV vancomycin , rifabutin , and
Linezolid. She had positive cultures on 3/12/06 and then again
on 2/6/06 both blood cultures from PICC line grew gram-negative
cocci in clusters. PICC line was removed. She had ongoing
bacteremia. She had a repeat TEE on 4/8/06 , they indicated no
vegetation seen on the aortic valve; however , she continued to be
bacteremic. She was then continued on vancomycin and daptomycin
per ID. Linezolid was discontinued on 5/2/06 per ID. She
maintained negative blood cultures since 5/6/06.
d. Atrial fibrillation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation
with rates of 130s on 7/20/06 , was given diltiazem 10 mg x2 then
started on IV amiodarone. She converted to sinus rhythm with
amiodarone , finished IV load , and continued on 200 mg daily. It
was planned for her to taper from there.
5. Renal. Status post renal transplant on FK , CellCept , and
prednisone. The patient had a renal ultrasound , which was
negative for hydronephrosis , obstruction or infarct. She had a
renal transplant biopsy on 3/3/06 , which results indicative
mild tubular damage and capillaritis suggestive of humeral
rejection. She received IVIG x2 , pulse steroids. She progressed
to have an increase in her creatinine to 5.7 and decreased urine
output. The patient was initiated on dialysis on 5/5/06 , again
on 1/27/06 , 4/3/06 , and 7/13/06. She then was maintained on
Monday , Wednesday , and Friday schedule for dialysis and was
placed on Renagel for increased phosphate.
6. GI. The patient throughout her hospital course had
increasing abdominal fluid collection with increasing shortness
of breath. She had an abdominal ultrasound to assess her amount
of fluids and marked for paracentesis. CIS marked the patient
for paracentesis. Paracentesis was attempted at the bedside with
only 700 mL of bloody gastric ascites. The patient had minimal
improvement of discomfort. The fluid was sent for gram stain ,
LDH , albumin , white blood cell count , and differential. CT of
the abdomen was consistent with moderate amount of ascites on the
right side of the abdomen mildly distended small bowel , question
of an ileus , which began to improve as of 10/26/06.
7. Neurologically , the patient had a new onset of psychiatric
manic disorder versus organic dementia. Her mood and behavior
had seemed to improve on 6/24/06 ; however , the patient
verbalized multiple concerns from 3/25/06 to 10/10/06 about
impending , worsening of condition , and possibility of death.
8. Pulmonary. The patient continued to spike fevers about 103
on 11/24/06. Chest x-ray had showed left lower lobe pneumonia.
ID was consulted. The patient was given ceftazidime 2 g IV x1.
On 2/15/06 , the patient was transferred out of the MICU. She
was hypotensive; however , her CVP line showed a blood pressure of
15-20 points higher systolic then what were showing on her
peripheral blood pressure cuff. She had nosocomial pneumonia ,
which had improved. Her ceftazidime was stopped and aztreonam
was stopped. Her ileus seemed to be improving. She had a bowel
movement. She also developed hyperbilirubinemia and therefore
amiodarone was stopped. Her NG tube was removed. Her abdomen
remained tight from fluid overload. Her dialysis alternating
with ultrafiltration. Fluid form her abdomen grew E. coli , on
vancomycin. She was on Nexium orally. Her feeding tube was
placed secondary to malnutrition and third spacing. She was
started on Mepron 10 mL per hour , meropenem was started on
10/10/06 for a question of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Plan was for paracentesis on 7/25/06. Renally , the patient
remained anuric and dialysis dependent. FK was continued and
CellCept was discontinued on 1/17/06. The patient continued to
have thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and anemia. In the early
morning of 5/28/06 , the patient began having large volume emesis
with aspiration. She was transferred to the medical intensive
care unit and resulted in respiratory arrest , pulses , electrical
activity arrest. A code was initiated with intubation. The
patient decompensated and became very hypotensive. Despite the
efforts of CPR , the patient became profoundly bradycardiac and
advanced to PA again , not responding. After 1.5 hour FR code ,
efforts were discontinued. The patient was pronounced at 8
o&apos;clock a.m. deceased.

three day history of worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.
His cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , positive
family history , and hypercholesterolemia. The patient does not
smoke. The patient had a screening echocardiogram in 30 of November in
Mewo Medical Center which revealed normal LV function , trace
AI , question of aortic valve prolapse. The patient has been doing
well and notes that beginning in early 1990 began to have what was
described as stable exertional angina. An ETT in 13 of October was
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. The patient
reports that approximately six months ago he noticed some slight
DOE and fatigue at work. The patient also reports that he has
frequent chest pain in the morning , described as substernal without
any radiation. The pain is associated with shortness of breath but
no nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis , palpatations or dizziness. This
pain usually lasts approximately 15 to 20 minutes and the patient
did not take nitroglycerin for these pains. Two days prior to
admission the patient reports having a similar episode of a.m.
chest pain , worse than usual , he decided to take nitroglycerin ,
however , his nitroglycerin was over six months old and were without
effect. On the day of admission the patient reports feeling severe
chest pain after vigorous exercise and this pain radiates to his
jaw. This pain persisted until he went to his FRED VENHI appointment at
2 p.m. with Dr. Clement Feuerberg , and Dr. Statum sent the patient to the
EW. The patient&apos;s pain was relieved in the EW with Nitro Paste ,
TNG SL , MSO4 , and IV TNG. The pain lasted a total of approximately
three hours. The patient was admitted to the THCH and was
noticeably diaphoretic on arrival and complaining of some recurrent
chest pain which was relieved with a single SL TNG. A finger stick
revealed a glucose of 60 at the time. The patient denies PND ,
lower extremity edema , claudication or orthopnea. He admits to

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Patient is a 64 yo woman with clear cell uterine CA originally
diagnosed in 9/22 - now status post hysterectomy , radiation , cycles of
carboplatin and taxol and then single agent doxil given myelosupression
and thrombocytopenia. She presents with progression of left lower
extremity edema and groin pain. Multiple studies have revleaed an
iliopsoas fluid collection which was drained recently and
previously revelaed atypical cells and were thought consistet with
radiation effect. On 8/28 she underwent an U/S of the LLE which was
negative for DVT , but a cystic struction was again noted in the
iliopsoas and the patient noted that her leg increased in size and she
had worsening groin pain. She was admitted for drainage , pain control
and imaging. ---
PMH: hypercholesterolemia , OA -----
Meds: Ibuprofen PRN , tylenol PRN , dilaudid
PRN -----
Allergies: NKDA -------
Status: afebrile , VSS , LLE edematous and tense , RRR , CTA b/l. abd
benign. Drain left groin draining serosanguinous fluid.
--------
Key studies:
U/S 8/28 11.5x5.5x2.7 cyctic structure in left iliopsoas
MRA/MRV/MRI: MRA: Normal aorta , proximal segments of celiac trunk , SMA ,
bilateral solitary renal arteries are widely patient. The common external ,
internal iliac arteries wiedely patent , IMA not well visualized.
MRV: IVC , bilateral renal veins , bilateral iliac and femoral veins are
patient. Left iliac and proximal superficial femoral vein are small in
caliber due to compression by ?seroma. No thrombus idenitified
Other finding: Liver , spleen , bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Kidneys are normal in size , symmetric perfusion. Large fluid collection
in the L iliopsoas from the sacroiliac joint to the insertion of the
iliopsoas.
------
Hospital course/A&amp;P
1. LLE edema and groin pain: Given pain and fluid reaccumulation drain
placed by IR 9/9 and removed 11/8 Fluid was sterile with no evidence of
infection. Drain was removed due to a concern for the risk of infection
of a sterile fluid collection , particularly given it&apos;s relative proximity
to a joint and the risks that could be associated with a joint infection
in this woman. As per IR&apos;s recommendations , we asked our colleagues in
orthopedics to participate in this patient&apos;s care. They had no
recommendations for the short term given that her fluid collection had
been drained and she was pain free. Recommended that she could follow up
with Dr. Gene Alban in Orthopedic Oncology if her pain/fluid collection
recurs.
2. Pain control: Patient&apos;s pain was well controlled by IV morphine ( 2mg
Q4-6 hrs ) after drain placement- only required one day of IV morphine.
Following drainage of the fluid collection she noted that she was much
more comfortable and was well controlled with ibuprofen and low dose MSIR
( minimal requirement ). Will be discharged with prescription for MSIR
should her pain recur.
3. Prophylaxis: Patient received one dose of therapeutically dosed
lovenox pending the read of the MRI - then switched to prophylactic dosed
lovenox.
Patient remained full code throughout this hospitalization
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have worsening of your leg/groin pain , you should contact your
oncologist.
If you have fevers or chill , nausea/vomiting , or shortness of breath , you
should contct your physician
You were treated for a seroma/hematoma adjacent to your iliopsoas muscle.
There was no evidence of infection based on the fluid collected from this
drainage. If the pain you were having recurs , or your leg edema worsens ,
you should contact your primary oncologist to determine the future
treatment plan. You were seen by Orthopedic Surgery during this admission
- their recommendation was that nothing needed to be done acutely and that
you could follow up with Dr. Clifton Walkner for further evaluation if you
are interested.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
F/U with Kenton Babic - ortho onc if needed. F/u final results of
cytology/gram stain for drained fluid.

Albuterol nebulizer q1 hour treatments. She was also given Bactrim
DS one p.o. b.i.d. for presumed bronchitis. The patient did well
over the hospital course with increasing peak flow to over 200 on
discharge. Her lung exam was also much improved with better air
movement on discharge. Immediately after admission , the patient
complained of one episode of burning , substernal chest relieved
with one sublingual Nitroglycerin. She did have EKG changes with
new upright T-waves throughout the precordium and in I , different
from admission. She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction and
had flat CK&apos;s. Her upright T-waves in I and V3-V6 continued
throughout the hospital course. This was thought to be secondary
to labile Q-waves as noted in the past. The patient was discharged
on four days of Bactrim and a Prednisone taper.

Discharge Date: 2/10/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old woman ,
status post CABG times three in 7/6 ,
status post inferior myocardial infarction in 2/10 with a peak CPK
of 714. She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABG
consisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2
and RCA. In 9/16 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion with
a question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; a
circumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gram
showed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , she
had substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingual
nitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which was
a duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 5/20 which showed
mild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status post
colonoscopy in 9/16 which showed diverticulitis. She has a history
of anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated with
iron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months of
a 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she had
melena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough and
nocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbing
periodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffee
grounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquids
and solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She had
a sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.
The pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 2/4 , she came
to the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be
110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. Her
JVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given three
sublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.
She was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she became
hypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units of
packed red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She went
to the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes. The A-set
revealed a CPK of 54; B-set was 48; C-set was 36. An ABG was 132 ,
99 , 7.43 , 33. Potassium was 4.2 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: JVD was 9 cm on admission and decreased;
scar at the left base of the neck secondary
to a basal cell resection; II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
left sternal border without gallop. The lungs revealed crackles at
the right base one quarter. She had a kyphoscoliosis. The abdomen
was benign. The neuro exam was nonfocal , though she had some past
pointing secondary to poor eyesight.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 7/5 , she was transferred to the floor. She
complained of some left arm pain secondary to her
IV , but she had no EKG changes and this improved with hot
compresses. She was guaiac negative. On the evening of 4/21 , she
was noted to be trace guaiac positive in the stool. On 7/6 at 7:30
AM , she complained of substernal chest pain which radiated to both
upper extremities with tingling bilaterally. This did not resolve ,
even after giving Maalox , four sublinguals and 12 mg of morphine
and three inches of Nitropaste. Her blood pressure was stable at
130/80 , heart rate was 68 , and she was afebrile. Her substernal
chest pain ranged between 7-3 , and she was given 20 mEq of Kay
Ciel. Her potassium was 3.8 , hematocrit 32.8 and stable. She was
given two more units of packed red blood cells after having been
given two more units of packed red blood cells between 7/5 and 10/27
IV nitroglycerin 50 units was started after one hour and 15 minutes
of pain. This was increased to 100 units. EKG changes were noted
as a flattening in V4 through V6 with no ST depressions , and she
had a T wave down in V3 which was new since admission. On 7/6 , she
was transferred to the unit. Her CKs were negative; A-set was 27 ,
B-set was 29 , C-set was 57 and D-set was 65. A catheterization
showed right atrial pressures of 12 , PCWP of 16 , SVR 1 , 000 , PVR 76 ,
PA 34/14 , cardiac output 6.8. Grafts from the aorta to the OM ,
aorta to the RCA and LIMA to the LAD were all patent. LAD showed
100% proximal occlusion , LAD diagonal showed a 50% long proximal
and circumflex showed a 50% proximal , OM-2 showed a 70% occlusion
at the origin. There was a mild increase in right and left sided
pressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Her
hematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on the
morning of 7/10 , and the impression was of a large hiatal hernia
with no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommended
that she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeat
colonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days. The
sed rate was 25 , PT and PTT within normal limits , potassium 4.2 ,

Discharge Date: 8/8/2005
ATTENDING: LUCIEN KURT DYRON MD
This discharge summary summarizes his Intensive Care Unit course
from March , 2005 to July , 2005.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Mr. Adas is a 69-year-old
African-American male who is postoperative day 11 from a
reoperative aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair for
endocarditis. His postoperative course was complicated by
Mobitz&apos;s type II heart block and long sinuses pauses for which he
was transferred to the ICU on account of snow storm making
staffing issues difficult to take care of him on the floor. He
remained in the Intensive Care Unit one day.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His Intensive Care Unit course by system is:
1. Neurologic: The patient was complaining of pain at his
Quintin catheter insertion site for which he was treated with
oxycodone.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was initially transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit with bradycardia and Mobitz&apos;s type II heart
block and 6-7 second sinus pauses. He was asymptomatic for all
of these events with good hemodynamics. However , given the large
snow storm and short staffing , it was felt that he would be
better off in the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring. He
had no major issues in the Intensive Care Unit. He was switched
from labetalol and amlodipine as well as his beta blocker eye
drops so as to not exacerbate his heart block. He did have some
difficult to control hypertension which was treated with
hydralazine which was titrated up to 80 q.i.d. with good result.
In addition , he was maintained on Losartan and Lisinopril. He
was followed by the Electrophysiology Service who came to the
conclusion that the patient does need a permanent pacemaker;
however , the issue of when and how to place the pacemaker has yet
to be resolved as the patient has difficult venous access issues
given his multiple clotted AV fistulas and poor venous access
sites. The Electrophysiology Service and Dr. Wickert are in the
process of deciding what the best approach for his pacemaker is.
Hew as in a sinus rhythm with occasional asymptomatic bradycardia
in the 40s but otherwise stable rhythm.
3. Respiratory: No issues.
4. GI: He is on a renal diet which he tolerated. He is also on
a bowel regimen and on 2 liter fluid restriction per the Renal
Team.
5. Renal: The patient is followed by renal medicine. He is
anuric and he is dialyzed Saturday , Tuesday , Thursday. He had no
acute renal issues although his potassium was somewhat on the
high side between 4.8 and 5.0 but trended down by the next day.
He was followed by the Vascular Surgery Service who have
determined that his right AV fistula is not salvageable. They
plan to do a left AV fistula on an outpatient basis once the
patient&apos;s current cardiac issues have resolved and he is
discharged from the hospital.
6. Endocrine: No issues.
7. Heme: No issues. The patient is on an aspirin 81 mg a day.
8. ID: The patient came in to the Intensive Care Unit on
Vancomycin , Gentamicin and Rifampin for presumed endocarditis
although all of his cultures have been negative. He has
continued on these in the hospital. He is afebrile without a
white count.

Discharge Date: 4/19/1993
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
PSORIASIS.
CERVICAL DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE.
STATUS POST COLECTOMY.
STATUS POST RIGHT HERNIA REPAIR.
KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
STATUS POST NON Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
IN 1989.
STATUS POST LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING
PTCA IN 1989.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white
male with known cardiac disease ,
status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 1989 , status post
left anterior descending PTCA in 1989 , who was admitted following
an episode of post myocardial infarction chest pain from an outside
hospital. Cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , history of
myocardial infarction. Cardiac history dates back to 3/21 when the
patient experienced substernal chest discomfort and ruled in for
non Q wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac catheterization showed
95% left anterior descending lesion , left circumflex 70% lesion and
diffuse right coronary artery disease. He had PTCA of the left
anterior descending lesion and did well for approximately two
months but was readmitted at that time in 6/11 with recurrent chest
discomfort. A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 30%
left anterior descending lesion , 40% circumflex lesion and 80% OMB3
lesion and 50% mid and distal RCA stenoses. He had no angina until
approximately two days prior to admission when he presented to an
outside hospital with substernal chest discomfort. He rule in for
an inferior myocardial infarction with CK peaking at 2316. He was
treated with morphine , IV nitroglycerin , aspirin , heparin and IV
streptokinase. He had recurrent chest discomfort post myocardial
infarction and was transferred to Vu Pe Headcount Hospitals .
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , the patient&apos;s medications were
optimized to increase his beta blockade.
Eventually , the patient was weaned from IV nitroglycerin and IV
heparin to oral nitrates. The patient had no further chest
discomfort during the admission and had a predischarged modified
Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test. He did have some episodes
of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure ,
however , this resolved with Lasix. EKG was consistent with
inferior myocardial infarction on transfer. On 6/9 , he had a
modified Bruce protocol stress test for which he went nine minutes
without chest discomfort or shortness of breath. This was read as
evidence of no ischemia. The patient was discharged home on
5/19/93.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. MEDICATIONS: On discharge included
diltiazem , 120 mg po b.i.d.; metoprolol , 75 mg po b.i.d.; Isordil ,
20 mg po t.i.d.; aspirin , 325 mg po q day; Glyburide , 25 mg po q
day; gemfibrosol , 600 mg po b.i.d.; omeprazole , 20 mg po q day.

LABORATORY DATA: significant for potassium 3.3 ,
BUN 13 , creatinine od 2 , BNP 7900. One set of negative cardiac
enzymes. White blood cell count 3.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets
248 , INR 1.2 , EKG showed some new ST depressions in the inferior
and lateral leads that were new from prior. Chest x-ray; PA and
lateral showed a new ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe
likely representing pneumonia. Chest CT without contrast showed
no evidence of cavitary lesion within the lungs , a small area of
consolidation within the right upper lobe consistent with
possible pneumonia. A nodule in the right upper lobe that was 8
mm in size and stable from 2005 , but should be followed up
approximately every 6 months with follow up with CAT scan of the
chest. There were coronary calcifications.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious disease , the patient was admitted with a right
upper lobe pneumonia somewhat concerning for aspiration
pneumonia , pneumonia given that she was found to have a large
amount of secretions upon admission. She was initially treated
with vancomycin to cover for MRSA as well as ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. She had nasal swabs that were negative for
influenza A&amp;P. She also had a PPD placed on May , 2006 ,
that was negative. She had two sputum cultures that were sent
for AFB smears that were negative for acid fast bacilli. Her
vancomycin was discontinued after 24 hours. She has completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. She has to complete another 5
doses of cefpodoxime have outpatient that should be admitted
administered three times a week after hemodialysis. The patient
had a chest CT that showed no evidence for a cavitary lesion.
She does however have a pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe
that should be followed with interval CAT scans as an outpatient.
The patient also had a beta glucan and serum tests that are
currently pending. The patient has had negative culture data.
She was initially placed on tuberculosis precautions , however ,
given the absence of cavitary lesion on chest CT , negative PPD
and negative sputum cultures , the likelihood of TB was thought to
be extremely low and her precautions were discontinued.
2. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had a speech
and swallow evaluation for concern of aspiration. She was placed
on mechanical soft honey thick liquid diet that she should
continue upon discharge. She will likely need a repeat speech
and swallow evaluation while at rehabilitation and may possibly
need a video swallow examination if she continues to show signs
of aspiration. In addition , the head of her bed should be kept
elevated. The patient was also noted to have hypercalcemia
during this admission. The patient should have a serum protein
electrophoresis as an outpatient for further evaluation.
Currently , her calcium supplementation during dialysis has been
discontinued. In addition , her PTH level is currently pending
and should be followed up as an outpatient.
3. Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis. She undergoes hemodialysis Monday , Wednesday and
Friday and she should continue this upon discharge at the Alllou Lorda Hospital
at Son Prai , 927 511 8904. She was
admitted to the renal service. She continues on Nephrocaps.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient had three sets of negative
cardiac enzymes and ruled out for myocardial infarction. The
patient is status post recent non-ST elevation MI was continued
on aspirin , Plavix , statin , ACE inhibitor , Beta-blocker. She
appeared euvolemic on examination.
5. GI: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient received PPI and heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
7. Wound care: The patient was seen by the wound care consult
service for a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer. She should have
DuoDERM dressing applied to this ulcer every three days. She
also benefits from an air mattress and vitamin C supplementation
as well.
8. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s TSH was normal at 1.12.
9. Hematology: The patient had evidence of anemia of chronic
disease. Folate was normal , B12 was normal.
10. Psych: The patient continued on Prozac for depression.
11. Neuro: The patient continued on Trileptal for her seizure
disorder.
CODE STATUS: The patient is full-code and her health care proxy
is her son.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS Tylenol 650 mg p.o. every six hours , as
needed for pain , not to exceed 4 grams a day , aspirin 81 mg p.o.
once a day , albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs every 4 hours ,

Discharge Date: 6/10/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Jesus Wigham , whose past medical
history includes diabetes ,
hypertension , and multiple prior coronary interventions
( ballooned ) , presents in a stable state for elective coronary
artery bypass graft , after a cardiac catheterization showed two
vessel disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 23 of November the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting , left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to left coronary
artery and then to obtuse marginal. After surgery the patient
became hypotensive and ischemic. A new angiogram was performed
which showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occluded
sequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronary
artery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft.
The patient was reoperated; a new coronary artery bypass graft was
performed on 23 of June , a new vein graft was placed to the right
posterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal.
An intra-aortic balloon pump had been previously placed and was
removed three days later.
OTHER EVENTS DURING HOSPITAL STAY: 1. Volume over-load for
which the patient has still
some fluid retention and is still being on diuretics.
2. The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins ,
mostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloon
pump. Some hematoma developed but it never worsened. Vascular
Surgery was consulted but no further intervention was done.
3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her
surgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. Infectious
Disease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as
the patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said
that this was the reason for her redness. In the last two days of
her stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more
visible , and there was some question of increased white blood
cells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be
continued for about seven more days.
4. The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for a
urinary tract infection.
5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time ,
a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no
obstruction to venous flow.
6. The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation and
was treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta
blockers , namely Lopressor.
CURRENT CONDITION: At present the patient is in stable condition ,
afebrile , heart rate 81 in sinus , blood
pressure 120/60 , respiratory rate 20 , with a saturation of 96% in
room air. Her blood sugar is 189 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium
137 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 151 , white blood cells 10.7 ,
hematocrit 28.4 , and INR 1.4.
The list of medications is included in the discharge summary.
Thank you for accepting this patient.

Discharge Date: 10/20/2003
Date of Discharge: 10/20/2003
ATTENDING: EUSEBIO HENDLER MD
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Mitral valve regurgitation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma
requiring chemotherapy and radiation therapy , as well as a
history of splenectomy , asthma , and history of tobacco use , who
presents to our service with symptoms of congestive heart failure
including dyspnea on exertion , lower extremity bilateral edema ,
and decrease exercise tolerance. On the day of admission ,
2/22/03 , she underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed
clean coronary arteries. On August , 2003 , she then
underwent an elective mitral valvuloplasty , 26 Carpentier-Edwards
pericardial , with size 26 Cosgrove-Edwards ring and vegectomy.
In the immediate postoperative period , she was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit initially requiring 0.5 of
epinephrine to maintain proper pressure. Epinephrine was weaned
to off on postoperative day #1. She was extubated in the evening
of the day of surgery and epinephrine was subsequently weaned to
off. Gentle diuresis was begun on postoperative day #1 as well
as low dose beta blocker , which she tolerated well. She was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Step Down Unit on
postoperative day #1 , where diuresis was increased. Baby aspirin
was begun , and the patient continued to make excellent
cardiovascular progress. On February , 2003 , she began to
complain of some persistent numbness and tingling of the left
lower extremity , which she felt to be interrupting her attempts
to stand and maintain balance. For further treatment , a
Neurology consult was obtained. Per Neurology , she was found to
have no weakness at the left lower leg and foot , although when
pressure was exerted on the foot , she reported an uncomfortable
tingling throughout the leg. She reported no back pain and no
change in bowel or bladder control. Sensory examination was
found to be intact , however , soft touch and pin sensation tested
in the lateral leg below the knee caused a spreading tingling
sensation throughout the left lower extremity. Per Neurology
recommendations , Neurontin 300 mg q.d. was begun and it was
recommended that she follow up with the Department of Neurology
following discharge if the tingling sensation has not improved.
With aggressive diuresis , the patient was able to regain her
postoperative weight and by the day of discharge was 1.7
kilograms below her preoperative weight. She has made excellent
cardiovascular progress following this surgery and is anticipated
to continue her rehabilitation at home with VNA System.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese young woman alert
and oriented x 3. HEENT: No carotid bruits or JVD present.
Pulmonary: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2. No murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops appreciated. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ pulses at
all extremities bilaterally. Trace edema at the bilateral lower
extremities to mid calf. Skin: Midline sternotomy incision well
approximated , healing well. No areas of erythema or drainage
noted.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 141 , potassium
4.2 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.0 , calcium 8.9 , magnesium 2.6 , white

SERVICE:
Bili
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Lamont Wolnik , M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Aspiration pneumonia.
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:
Thalamic stroke , left hemiparesis , hypertension , diabetes ,
expressive aphasia status post VP shunt.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of a recent right
hemorrhagic stroke in 8/21 now with minimal purposeful activity
who follows simple commands and lives in a nursing home who
presents with a likely aspiration pneumonia. He was noted to be
hypoxic after a vomiting episode at his nursing home. He was
unable to provide a history but the events were recounted by the
nursing home staff. On 10/9/05 , he had fevers to 101.5 and
congestion throughout the day despite getting nebs and oxygen ,
his condition did not improve , he vomited twice and was noted to
be hypoxic to an oxygen saturation of 84% on 5 liters of O2 , he
also had a temperature of 101.6 , a heart rate of 127 , a blood
pressure of 140/80 and was sent to the En Medical Center Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department , the
patient&apos;s vital signs showed a temperature of 102.6 , heart rate
of 133 , respiratory rate of 24 , blood pressure 155/72 and 93%
oxygen saturation on nasal cannula. His EKG initially showed ST
elevations inferiorly. He was evaluated by Cardiology who felt
that given his comorbidities and poor functional status he was
not a candidate for cardiac catheterization. His EKGs
spontaneously normalized without intervention. His first set of
cardiac enzymes was negative. His chest x-ray showed a
left-sided pneumonia and he had a white blood cell count of 34.
He received 2 liters of normal saline , cefotaxime , and Flagyl.
He also received Lopressor and aspirin. Of note , the patient had
been given Flagyl in the nursing home , which was started on
10/4/05.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Of note , the patient had a recent medical history significant for
a right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke , which resulted in left
hemiparesis on an admission 7/14/05 to 1/29/05 during which a
VP shunt was placed that hospitalization was complicated by an
aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted on 2/6/05 to 10/21/05
for a change in mental status during which he was given
antibiotics on and off for the VP shunt. He resolved during this
hospitalization to baseline and was discharged to the nursing
home. Past medical history is also significant for history of
aspiration pneumonia status post a PEG tube 10/27 , diabetes ,
hypertension , aortic stenosis , colon cancer and spinal fusion in
2002.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Clonidine 0.2 q.a.m. , 0.4 q.p.m. , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , HCTZ 25
daily , Lantus 70 , lisinopril 40 daily , Norvasc 10 daily , Keppra
1000 at bedtime , terazosin 2 at bedtime , omeprazole 20 daily ,
Jevity 1.2 at 90 mL per hour with free water bolus of 240 mL
q.i.d. , Colace , Senna , MVI.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives alone , no smoking , no alcohol by report. Currently
lives a Pu
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs on admission were significant for a white count of 36 ,
hematocrit 45 , platelets of 327 , 000 , creatinine of 1.2 up from
baseline of 0.7 , remainder of his Chem-7 was normal. His cardiac
enzymes on admission showed a CK of 79 , CK-MB of 1.3 and troponin
less than assay. His UA was negative. Chest x-ray showed left
mid lung hazy opacity. Abdomen and pelvis CT showed no acute
processes. Head CT showed a right VP shunt and no acute changes.
EKG as described above.
CONSULTANTS DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:
Included Cardiology for question of cardiac catheterization as
described above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pneumonia: The patient was thought to have a likely
aspiration pneumonia despite his PEG tube because of reported
vomiting at the nursing home. He was put on broad antibiotic
coverage of vancomycin , ceftazidime , and Flagyl. He was
continued on a 14-day course of antibiotics with clinical
improvement. His antibiotics were discontinued after 14 days and
he remained afebrile with the normal white count. Of note , on
2/16/05 , he had another episode of vomiting , which was thought
to result in another aspiration event. However , repeat chest
x-rays showed no additional pneumonia and given that he was
treated with a full two-week course of antibiotics it was decided
to end his course of antibiotics and he remained afebrile with a
normal white blood cell count.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient initially had ST elevations
normalized. This was thought likely to be due to demand ischemia
given its complete resolution. Per Cardiology recommendations ,
he was not a candidate for long-term anticoagulation or cardiac
catheterization. He was continued on medical management without
further incident.
3. Hypertension: The patient was persistently hypertensive and
his blood pressure medications were titrated up and additional
medications were added as described in discharge medication list.
4. Diabetes: The patient&apos;s insulin regimen was titrated up to
cover persistently high morning blood sugars given tube feeds
overnight.
5. Neurological: The patient had a baseline aphasia and was
difficult to communicate with , however , as his pneumonia
resolved , his mental status improved and he was able to
communicate with short phrases and answer yes or no questions.
6. FEN: He was receiving tube feeds overnight per Nutrition
recommendations. He was also receiving NPH and regular insulin
as described in discharge medications.
7. C. difficile: The patient had some diarrhea and was tested
for C. diff. This returned positive and he was continued on
Flagyl for a total of 3-4-week course as determined by the rehab
facility.
CODE STATUS:
Full code.
Because of difficulty communication with the patient , it was
unclear what his exact code status was so he remained full code.
His mother is his next of kin but due to her own medical problems
and a recent hospitalization , she was unreachable and it was
unclear whether she had capacity for decision making. There was
an ethics consult meeting on 4/4/05 to determine the goals of
care. Per discussion at that meeting which is documented in the
medical chart , It was decided that he remain full code. This
will need to be readdressed with Mr. Feltmann at some point when it
can be determined if he is competent for making this decision.
Please see the chart for further details on the results of this
ethics consult. Further questions regarding this can be
addressed to Dr. Lezama , the attending physician.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
Significant for persistent aphasia , ability to answer questions
yes or no with occasional short phrases. A 3/6 holosystolic
murmur heard loudest at the left upper sternal border and the
remainder of the exam was unremarkable.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DORIAN SPORN MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Congestive iheart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pending.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bloating , abdominal distention.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old woman with a
history of an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who
presents with bloating , abdominal distention , and fatigue. The
patient&apos;s idiopathic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 1990. The
patient had a Chronicle device to monitor filling pressures
placed in 2001 , which has been nonfunctional since 2004. The
patient had worsening symptoms in September 2004 , which led to an
admission for diuresis. She showed evidence of fluid overload on
admission of diuresis with IV Lasix and IV dobutamine. The
patient developed a Chronicle device lead thrombus and was
started on anticoagulation. The patient underwent a right heart
cath in September 2004 , which showed an artery pressure of 10 , wedge
pressure of 25 , SVR 2074 , PVR 326 , and CI of 1.5. Post-diuresis
after addition of hydralazine and Isordil , the patient&apos;s RA
pressures were RA=8 , pulmonary artery=50/24 , cardiac index of 2.4
with SVR of 1205. The patient&apos;s most recent admission was in
August 2004 with decompensated heart failure , during which time
she was diuresed with IV Lasix , metolazone , and dobutamine and
diuresed 11 liters. The patient also began workup for cardiac
transplant at that time. The patient on this admission describes
one week of abdominal distention , lower extremity edema , and
stable two-pillow orthopnea. The patient describes no PND ,
shortness of breath , or palpitations. She also denies dietary or
med noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Glyburide 10 in the a.m. and 5 in the p.m.
2. Digoxin 0.125 q.d.
3. Probenecid 500 q.d.
4. Multivitamin one tab q.d.
5. KCL 20 mEq q.d.
6. Celexa 20 mg q.d.
7. Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Ativan 0.5 t.i.d.
9. Coumadin 5 q.p.m.
10. Isordil 40 t.i.d.
11. Torsemide 200 b.i.d.
12. Lisinopril 2.5 q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with three daughters. She is
an ex-custodian with past tobacco use but no ethanol use. The
patient&apos;s family has no history of cardiomyopathy.
SIGNIFICANT LABS ON ADMISSION: Normal renal function with a BNP
of 1018 and no evidence of bandemia. EKG on admission shows
sinus tachycardia at 105 with normal axis , widened QRS , normal
PR , and no evidence left atrial enlargement , and no change since
1/25 Left heart cath in 1990.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient has no known CAD. She had a troponin at
admission of 0.12 , which subsequently went down to 0.10 less than
assay. It is thought to be secondary to right ventricular strain
with volume overload. The patient was initially started on
aspirin and a statin; however , given her no evidence of CAD and a
normal cholesterol panel , both aspirin and statin were
discontinued.
Pump: The patient presented as &quot;cold and wet&quot; with poor forward
flows secondary to systolic dysfunction and likely increased SVR.
The patient was started on dobutamine for improved inotrope.
The patient was also put on a Lasix strip for diuresis after a
loading dose. The patient was maintained on Isordil and
hydralazine for pre and afterload reduction. Her ACE inhibitor
was held while on the Lasix strip. Metolazone also was used to
improve diuresis , and the patient was maintained on digoxin with
level checks every three days. The patient underwent an echo ,
which showed an EF of 15% , global akinesis with
moderate-to-severe MR , moderate TR , and no evidence of
dyssynchrony. The patient had moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction.
Rhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , especially
given the fact that she had no ICD in place. EP was consulted
and evaluated the patient for both an ICD and biventricular pacer
given no evidence of dyssynchrony on echo , it was decided that
the patient would undergo ICD placement only.
2. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine was 1.1 on admission and was
monitored closely with diuresis. On admission , she had a normal
UA.
3. Heme: The patient was placed on heparin instead of Coumadin
for Chronicle device lead thrombus with a PTT goal of 60-80. The
patient&apos;s platelets dropped from 222 to 166 during this admission
and tests were ordered for the HIT antibody. The patient&apos;s
platelets normalized , but unfortunately , the PF4 was positive.
It was felt that this was a false positive and this was confirmed
with a Heme consult. Heme recommended rechecking the PF4 in
three to four weeks and holding heparin products until the PF4
was rechecked. The patient would be restarted on Coumadin after
her ICD placement.
4. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on sliding scale
insulin and Lantus for diabetes management.
5. GI: The patient had right upper quadrant pain on admission
likely related to a congested liver. A right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed a normal liver with thickened gall bladder
walls and ascites , and her symptoms were improved with diuresis.
The patient was maintained on Nexium for prophylaxis.
6. Psych: The patient was continued on citalopram and Ativan
for depression and anxiety. Psych was consulted for assistance
with management.
7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was maintained on probenecid
for gout.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was on PPI and heparin until she
was on the HIT positive and was placed on Pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be determined at the time of
discharge.

Discharge Date: 5/17/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. ASTHMA.
4. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
5. HISTORY OF MELENA.
6. LOW BACK PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old black female
with a past history of hypertension
and congestive heart failure who presented to the emergency room
with increasing shortness of breath. In April 1991 , the patient
states that she had a bout of a cold with coughing and chills and
some substernal chest pressure. In October 1992 , the patient had
one 10-minute episode of substernal chest pain associated with
nausea , sweating and shortness of breath. Since then , she relates
increasing shortness of breath on exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea and ankle edema. She also has been coughing up
more mucus and at times , blood-stained. She also complains of
dysuria for approximately the past month without hematuria. In
October 1992 , she had one episode of melena which lasted two
weeks. There is no history of peptic ulcer disease. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for:
1. Asthma since early 20&apos;s. She was intubated once for asthma
in her early 20&apos;s.
2. Hypertension since she was a child.
3. History of congestive heart failure.
4. Hysterectomy secondary to fibroids at approximately age 20.
TAH , BSO.
5. Question of chronic renal insufficiency.
Medications at the time of admission are Lisinopril , Procardia ,
Albuterol nebulizer. Allergies are to IVP contrast. Family
history is positive for hypertension. Social history - she lives
with a 23-year-old son and just suffered a family tragedy in the
death of her youngest son who was shot to death three years ago.
Habits - she smokes 1/2 pack a day. She has over a 30-pack year
smoking history. She does not drink or engage in illicit drug use.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this is a moderately obese
black female in moderate respiratory
distress. Temperature is afebrile , blood pressure 160/90 , pulse
84 , respiratory rat 32 , O2 saturation 97% on two liters nasal
prong. Head and neck exam showed significant jugular venous
distention. Chest showed diffuse expiratory wheezes , some use of
accessory muscles. Cardiovascular exam had an S1 and S2 with no
murmur. The abdomen was obese , otherwise benign. The liver edge
was 12.0 - 14.0 cm by percussion. Rectal exam was guaiac negative.
Extremities had no cyanosis or clubbing but 1+ bilateral ankle
edema. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. Musculoskeletal
exam - there was an area of left paravertebral tenderness in the
lumbar sacral spine area.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 35.1 , platelet
count 246 , 000 , white count 9000 with 65%
polys , 1% bands. ABG on unclear FIO-2 was pH 7.48/37/73/95.5%
saturation. SMA-7 was significant for a BUN 19 , creatinine 1.4. PT
12.3 , PTT 31.7. Urinalysis was positive for traced blood and
leukocytes , too numerous to count white blood cells , 7-10 red blood
cells and 4% bacteria on microscopy. Urine culture grew klebsiella
sensitive to Bactrim. EKG was sinus at a rate of 80 , axis -29
degrees , intervals of .196/.116/.1478 , marked left ventricular
hypertrophy with left atrial abnormality with strain pattern in
V3-V6. Chest X-ray was significant for moderate pulmonary edema.
Lumbar sacral plain films showed no significant bony disease. An
Echocardiogram showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy ,
preserved systolic function , possible diastolic dysfunction and new
posterior wall hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Renal ultrasound showed both kidneys to
be approximately 11.0 cm in size. No
renal artery stenosis was seen though it was a limited study due to
body habitus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was carried out by the GI
service and no significant lesions were found. The patient was
diuresed for congestive heart failure to which she responded well.
Her breathing was significantly improved by the second hospital
day. It is felt that her hypertension has contributed to at least
clinical evidence of her failure. While in the hospital , the blood
pressure was difficult to control and eventually required the use
of three medications. At the time of discharge , she was running
blood pressures in the range of 140-150 systolic and diastolic of
90 which is much improved for her. A repeat urine culture was
negative and the antibiotics were stopped. Her low back pain was
felt to be muscular in origin and she was given Flexeril for this.
She has no history of peptic ulcer disease but it has been decided
to institute a trial of H2 blocker therapy and reevaluate the need
for upper GI endoscopy in three weeks time. Her asthma was
relatively quiescent but it has been stressed to her that she
should continue to use her puffers.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable.
MEDICATIONS at the time of discharge are
Beclovent 4 puffs b.i.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Habitrol nicotine patch q. day , Procardia XL 90 mg
p.o. q. day , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Labetalol 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day. The
patient will follow up at Asacil Calcdennatchbo Valley Hospital on 1/26/92 at 6:10
p.m. She also has an appointment with GI clinic here on 11/10/92
at 2:30 p.m.

Discharge Date: 7/10/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Enos is a 32 year old woman who
presented with intermittent chest pain
and shortness of breath of two days duration. Her cardiac risk
factors include a positive family history but no diabetes , no
cholesterol , no hypertension , and no history of tobacco use. The
patient was in good health until two days prior to admission. At
that time , she noted 2/10 substernal chest pain radiating to the
left arm accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness. There
was no nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. The pain lasted
approximately 45 minutes and did not change with activity or
position. The pain and shortness of breath recurred approximately
two times that day. She had a fourth episode on the morning of
admission while watching television. She went to the Mali Medical Center where there was no improvement. An EKG there showed
flipped T waves across her precordium. The patient improved with
oxygen there. The pain recurred during an ambulance ride to the
Nortion Memorial Hospital where it was again relieved with
oxygen. The patient has no prior history of chest pain ,
palpitations , or shortness of breath. She denies orthopnea ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , edema , or previous dyspnea on
exertion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic low back pain. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cesarean section in 1986. CURRENT
MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: Tylenol with Codeine. FAMILY
HISTORY: Both her mother and father died of myocardial infarction ,
the mother at age 50 and the father at age 74. The patient has a
sister who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at age 37. The
patient denies alcohol , tobacco use , and drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese Hispanic woman who
was in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure was 110/80 and her pulse was 100 and regular. HEENT:
Examination was within normal limits. NECK: Supple. CHEST: Clear
to auscultation and percussion. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination
showed no jugular venous distention , S1 and S2 were regular with no
S3 , S4 , or murmur , and carotids were 2+/2+ with no bruits. ABDOMEN:
Obese , soft , and non-tender with good bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:
Femorals showed no ruits , there was no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema , and there were 2+/2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: The patient was alert and
oriented , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , and strength and
reflexes were symmetric.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , cholesterol was 202 ,
triglycerides 316 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.3 ,
hematocrit 42.2. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 92 and an axis of negative 12. Intervals were 0.17 , 0.07 ,
and 0.35. There was evidence of poor R wave progression and
flipped T in leads V1 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 32 year old woman with no prior cardiac
history who presents with chest pain at rest. She
has a strong family history and high triglycerides which makes us
question if there is a genetic predisposition for coronary artery
disease. Her EKG is clearly abnormal , however , it is unclear if
these are new or old changes. Patient was put on a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol and started on Nitrol Paste ,
Lopressor , and Aspirin. Her CPK initially were 243 with 2 MB and
later decreased to 202 , 141 , 132 , and 88. An echocardiogram done
during this admission showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild
hypokinesis of the inferoposterior walls , and slight apical
hypokinesis of the right ventricle with a question of prior
infarction. The patient underwent an initial exercise test during
which she went three minutes and 23 seconds on a standard Bruce
protocol. There was no evidence of ischemia. On a second exercise
test , the patient completed seven minutes of a Bruce protocol
stopping secondary to dyspnea and leg fatigue. An EKG during the
protocol showed minimal ST depressions in the inferior leads with
recovery and flipped T in the anterior leads. The impression was
that there was no evidence for ischemia although the patient did
not achieve a maximal heart rate. There appeared to be diminished
exercise tolerance. Patient was discharged with a follow-up
appointment in the TER GENERAL HOSPITAL Clinic.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ecotrin 325 mg one
q.d. , Micronase 5 mg p.o. q.d. , and sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. ANEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Christin is an 80 year old female who
presents to an outside hospital with
chest pain. She states the night prior to admission she felt some
shortness of breath and tightness in her chest upon laying down.
She took one sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. Thirty
minutes later took another sublingual Nitroglycerin , again without
relief. Shortness of breath was accompanied with increasing
feeling of chest tightness rated approximately 8/10. Took a third
Nitroglycerin without relief and felt her breathing became wheezy.
She then drove herself to an outside hospital for evaluation. She
was there treated with intravenous Lasix , morphine and
Nitroglycerin with resolution of her pain. EKG at outside hospital
showed anterolateral ST depression and her enzymes were negative
ruling out for myocardial infarction. She has cardiac risk factors
of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia and age. Her cardiac
symptomatology began in the fall of 1999 when she began to
experience chest discomfort with exertion and rest. Evaluation by
Dr. Jose Esparza showed high cholesterol with an LDL 141 , EKG with LVH
and nonspecific T wave flattening. A Thallium stress test in
August of 1999 was three minutes , fifty-two seconds duration ,
stopped secondary to shortness of breath , and there were
inferolateral ST depressions with inferior apical ischemia on
imaging. She had her symptoms managed medically with cholesterol
lowering and antihypertensive therapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , angina , Paget&apos;s
disease , anemia , osteoarthritis.

of 1.6. CK of 459 with an MB of 28.7. White blood cell count of
8 , 000 , hematocrit 26.9 , platelet count 238. Urinalysis was
negative. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats
per minute with ST segment depression V4 through V6 approximately 1
mm and approximately 1 mm ST depression in lead II.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Dison was admitted to Ster Hospital for evaluation of her angina after
ruling out at an outside hospital , however , on presentation her
laboratory values were consistent with a myocardial infarction and
her hospital course is summarized as follows.
1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Ms. Berish ruled in for a myocardial infarction
with a peak CK of 459 with an MB of 28.7. This decreased to 328
with an MB of 15.4 the following morning. Her troponin was 15.
She , however , remained asymptomatic and pain free throughout her
hospitalization. She underwent cardiac catheterization on April , 2000 which showed an okay left main , LAD with proximal 90%
stenosis , which underwent PTCA and stenting with good result , an
osteal D-1 80% lesion which underwent PTCA with good result , a
totally occluded proximal left circumflex and a right coronary with
a proximal 30% to 40% stenosis. She tolerated this procedure well
and without complications. Her medical regimen was altered to
include beta blockade , ACE inhibition and antihypertensives and
ischemics , as outlined below. Of note , left ventriculogram on her
catheterization showed anterior hypokinesis with 3+ mitral
regurgitation.
2. ANEMIA: Ms. Flewellen has a known normochromic , normocytic anemia
which was worked up during this hospitalization. She had a

ATTENDING: SIMKINS , WILFORD MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain/SOB.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , this is an 85-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , CRI , and prior
mitral valve replacement , and bioprosthesis presented with DE
compensated heart failure , increasing shortness of breath , and
chest pain. He has complex cardiovascular history and
progressive symptoms of heart failure. He had CABG in 1980 and
1990 and multiple PCI most recently in 6/29 with intervention on
SVG to the PDA. He had MVR in 1980 with bioprosthesis. He had
implantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 3/7 His
history of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has had
more marked decline over the past two years currently has SOB
typically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. He has
been admitted to the Mid-lo Caldent Medical Center several times for
management of CHF in 1/14 After diuresis he states he could
walk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk up
steps. He was at baseline until 3/29/05 when he had recurrent
episodes of chest pain respondive to sublingual nitroglycerin
associated with diaphoresis , nausea , palpitations , and
lightheadedness. On 10/17/05 , he had acute onset of shortness of
breath at rest after eating. He was admitted to the Ctr Medical Center and treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. MI was
excluded by serial enzymes. He was noted to be anemic. Other
lab values were consistent with hemolysis. As a part of his
workup , during ETT MIBI , he was able to walk 2 minutes 52 seconds
on the standard Bruce protocol , peak HR 94 , echo showed a dilated
LV , EF of 34% , mild global hypokinesis , and septal and apical
akinesis , enlarged dixed defect in the inferior apical wall with
moderate fixed defect in the inferior apical segment , and a small
amount of reversibility was noted in a mild inferior lateral
defect. Echocardiogram at CMC on 5/13 showed EF of 35% , septal
and apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitral
bioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mild
perivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonary
hypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferred
for evaluation and management of chest pain at Slifarb Hospital with ? need for catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF , EF is 25% , atrial fibrillation ,
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 , mild
COPD , status post AAA repair in 1995 , BPH , TIA/CVA , anemia , on
home O2 , status post AICD , pacer , status post sinus arrest in

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. Family very
involved. A former smoker , quit in 1980.
FAMILY HISTORY: Alcohol: No history of abuse. He is retired
supervisor in water department. Family history is otherwise
noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: NAD , 60s to 70s , afebrile , and BP is 100
to 110 over 50 to 60. Saturating at 89% on two liters , 94% on
four liters , JVD 12 , mild HJR , bronchial breath sounds , dullness

creatinine 1.8 , sodium 140 , BNP brain natriuretic peptide 482 , CK
61 , troponin 0.1 , haptoglobin less than assay , reticulocyte count
6.2 , and LDH 679.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: An 84-year-old man with complex medical issues
elderly and debilitated currently with last three to four heart
failures secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has undergone
multiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 ,
repeated PCI , most recently in 6/29 with intervention on SVG.
Revascularization options at this point are quite limited , the
amount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recent
submaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity of
the symptoms that he is experiencing. Unfortunately , his overall
debilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to be
tolerated. He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrival
and was aggressively diuresed. An echocardiogram was performed
on 7/24/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitral
valve leakage and an EF of 30%. A right heart catheterization
was performed on 8/23/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5;
RV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. In
summary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , with
large amounts of mitral regurgitation. For this reason , it was
discussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve
as he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his
end-stage heart and generally frail state. Plan as of the time
of this dictation is to undergo TEE on 2/18/05 to evaluate
whether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then
to have mitral valve clamping later this week. The patient was
diuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone.
The patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. He had a
bump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 10/3/05 and then it continued
to rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 2/10/05. As
for rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. O 2/6/05
brief round of V-tach , paced out of it. An AICD and pacer in
place.
Pulmonary: COPD. On O2 at home , however , with increased
desaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking ,
thought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation. On
Advair , Combivent , and albuterol nebulizer.
Renal: Elevated creatinine in mid 2s , baseline CRI creatinine
1.5 , and all medications were renally dosed.
FEN: Potassium and Magnesium scales , b.i.d electrolytes given
diuresis.
Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary to
mitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baseline
unknown. Given transfusion on 2/7/05. Transfuse for
hematocrit less than 30. PTT goal of 60 to 80 on heparin. He
will eventually be put on Coumadin.
CODE: Code status was changed during the time of this admission
to DNR/DNI/no pressors.
This is an interval dictation , please see addendum for remaining
hospital course and for discharge medications.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: KETTMANN , QUENTIN M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac arrest.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Sepsis/line infection , end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54-year-old female with a
history of cardiomyopathy , hypertension , diabetes type 2 ,
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who had a reported
cardiac arrest while receiving dialysis on 3/25/06 in her
outpatient clinic at Richgo Ster Ha She began to feel nauseated and
then vomited. The patient then reportedly went into VFib and was
shocked once by EMS , resulting in a narrow QRS complex rhythm.
She was intubated , received amiodarone and dopamine , as her BP was
approximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic. In the ED , a portable
chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities , risk of pulmonary edema and
ABG showed respiratory acidosis. Pt was transferred to the ICU for further
management.
Of note , she was recently hospitalized at Somver Vasky University Of Medical Center on 7/1/06
through 10/11/07 for initiation of dialysis after her BUN and creatinine
had risen remarkably from baseline. She was then asymptomatic at
that time. A fistulogram and angioplasty of her right AV fistula
was performed on 7/6/06 with prednisone premedication but it
was unsuccessful and therefore a left IJ tunneled dialysis
catheter was inserted on 1/18/06 with the tip ending in the
right atrium. She has since received dialysis treatments with no

SOCIAL HISTORY: This patient is single and has one son and one
grandson. Arturo Randklev is the healthcare proxy and is her son.
She worked 30 years for Wi Co Baya and is currently retired.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her vital signs were
temperature 97.6 , heart rate 72 , BP of 115/66 with mean arterial
pressure of 83 , respiratory 14 , sating 100% on 60% inspired FiO2.
Her CVP at admission was 17 to 20. The patient is an obese woman who was
intubated and responded to voice. Her pupils were 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her chest
exam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good air
movement. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythm
with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Her abdomen was soft ,
nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities showed no edema. Distal pulses were not palpable
bilaterally. She has thickened hyperpigmented skin
changes on both feet.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant labs on admission included a sodium
of 141 , potassium 4.1 , chloride of 102 , bicarb of 31 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 4.2 with a glucose of 156. Her hematocrit was 32.
An ABG at 10 p.m. of admission on FiO2 of 60% revealed a pH of 7.36 , pCO2 of
52 , pO2 91. Her first set of cardiac enzyme revealed a
creatinine kinase of 116 and the MB fraction of 0.7 and troponin
T of less than assay and lactate of 1.8. Tox screen was
negative. Urinalysis was remarkable for 2+ protein , 3+ blood and
positive for nitrates , and negative for leuks , 4 to 10 white
blood cells , 15 to 25 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , 1+ squamous
epithelial cells.
IMAGING: Significant imaging at admission was an x-ray for chest
x-ray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities , possible pulmonary
edema versus aspiration pneumonia , an EKG showing normal sinus
rhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and old
T-wave inversion in V2.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes who had an apparent
VFib arrest at hemodialysis on 7/8/06 and was shocked and
admitted to the CCU after being intubated in the Vibay General Hospital ED. The
patient had difficulty weaning from vent and was finally
extubated on 11/11/06. The CCU course was also complicated by
coag-negative Staph grown from a Quinton catheter blood draw.
The catheter was changed to over a wire on 11/11/06. Blood
cultures on 10/24/06 revealed likely Staph aureus growth for
which the patient received continuous vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Question of VFib arrest. Whether or not the patient actually
had a VFib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had an
arrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at
0.14 on 3/25/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shock
at hemodialysis. We believe what likely happened was a vagal event during
hemodialysis , possibly including a pause misread at VF by the defibrillator.
This explantation is supported by the observation that she has been
continuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a history
of vasovagal episodes in the past. Echo on 3/25/06 shows an EF
of 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy
and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was continued on
telemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker with
good response.
2. Volume status. The patient is very close to her dry weight
upon discharge , which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale. She
has been continued on hemodialysis with good results.
3. Possibly infected hemodialysis catheter. The patient had a
single set of coag-negative Staph positive blood cultures from
Quinton catheter on 11/12/06. Line was changed over wire
7/28/06 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels.
The patient continued to grow out coag-negative Staph , positive
blood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8/30/06.
4. Anemia. In the setting of end-stage renal disease her
baseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable.
5. Diabetes type 2. She was treated with a Portland protocol
during her ICU course wand was switched to a long and
short-acting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of NPH BID.
6. FEN. The patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet with
no signs of aspiration status post extubation.
7. Prophylaxis. The patient received heparin subcutaneously and
Nexium.
8. Code. The patient is full code. Her healthcare proxy is her
son Noble Schomberg , 284-659-2493.
DISPOSITION: This patient will likely need rehab and is being
screened by PT and OT and will likely be discharged to rehab when
bed is available.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year-old woman
with adult onset diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension admitted with chest pain , bradycardia , decreased blood
pressure , no previous history of chest symptoms. Risk factors
include positive adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
smoker , elevated cholesterol , no family history. Her present
history is notable for mid sternal chest pressure at three out of
ten while sitting and watching television. The pain did not
radiate. There was no shortness of breath , diaphoresis or nausea ,
except for pressure on left side of neck which is typical for her
when her blood pressure is elevated. The patient took Nifedipine
without relief and went to the bedroom to rest. There the pressure
became pain , three to four out of ten. She took Cardizem without
relief. She called EMS. The pain was relieved with the EMTs gave
nitroglycerin times two. This lasted 30 minutes. EMTs found her
to have blood pressure of 190/100 , heart rate 76 , normal sinus
rhythm. They gave two nitrospray , blood pressure decreased to
150/80 , heart rate 76 and after two minutes in the vehicle , she had
sinus bradycardia at 30-40 , blood pressure 120/80. She was given
0.5 mg of Atropine times one without any affect. She was brought
to the Chcine Medical Center , but initially she was
normotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 100. Then suddenly
she had bradycardia with heart rate of 30-40 and systolic blood
pressure of 75. She was given intravenous fluids and Atropine 0.5
mg times one. This lead to an increase in her blood pressure
systolic of 100 and her heart rate increased to 60. On transfer to
the floor , she was without chest pain , normotensive and in normal
sinus rhythm.

sinus rhythm at 83 with ST depressions in V4 and V5 , inverted
T-waves. Chest x-ray is consistent with congestive heart failure
and cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was taken to the operating room on 3/22/05 and
underwent CABG x2 with a Y graft , LIMA connects SVG1 to LAD and
SVG1 connects aorta to OM1. The patient was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit following surgery in stable condition. She
was extubated on her operative day without difficulties and was
hemodynamically stable postoperatively with adequate urine
output. The patient was started on a beta-blocker and was
followed by Diabetes Management Service for glycemic control.
She was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #2
in good condition; neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable , saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula ,
her diet was advanced and well tolerated. Her urine output was
brisk on diuretics. She was started on aspirin. White blood
cell count was noted to be elevated postoperatively , but the
patient remained afebrile and her white blood cell count trended
down for the remainder of her hospital stay. She was noted to
have a urinary tract infection for which she was treated with
ciprofloxacin and she continued to progress daily with mobility
and ambulation. The remainder of her hospital stay was
uncomplicated and she is discharged to home in good condition on
postoperative day #5. At time of discharge , her laboratory
chemistries include the following: sodium of 134 , potassium of
4.4 , BUN of 26 , creatinine of 0.9. Her white blood cell count has
steadily declined during the postoperative period and her white
blood cell count is 14 at time of discharge. The patient&apos;s hematocrit is
stable at 35 , and INR is 1.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atenolol 100 mg p.o.

Discharge Date: 10/24/2005
ATTENDING: WHITEY , OSWALDO MD
SERVICE: Et Sa Rill
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Acute and chronic renal failure and
congestive heart failure.
OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED: Type 2 diabetes ,
hyperlipidemia , acute and chronic renal insufficiency , upper GI
bleed with gastritis , ischemic cardiomyopathy , gout , sacral
decubitus ulcer.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Slauson is a 60-year-old
man with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and CHF , EF
of 35% , status post CABG in 1990 with redo in September 2005 , as well
as mitral and tricuspid valve repair and left atrial
reconstruction in September 2005. He presented asymptomatic from home
after being called by his primary cardiologist as the lab result
showed elevated BUN and creatinine at 244/4.1. This all occurred
in the setting of increased diuresis on torsemide , increasing the
dose from 100 mg by mouth twice daily to 150 mg by mouth twice
daily as well as a recent addition of Keflex for sacral decubitus
ulcer. On further questioning , Mr. Satoe reported symptoms of
increasing dyspnea on exertion with decreased exercise tolerance
as well as chronic loose stools with a history of C-diff
positivity but negative on last testing. He denied any chest
pain , pleurisy , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and both he and
his family denied any change in mental status as well as
hematuria or dysuria , although he did complain of mild urinary
hesitancy. Prior to presentation , he was directed to hold his
diuretics , included torsemide as well as all other nephrotoxic
agents including allopurinol , colchicine , digoxin , and
lisinopril.
His allergies include heparin to which he has heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.
In terms of medication reactions during this hospitalization , he
was placed on H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin ,
clarithromycin , and Nexium twice daily; and in reaction to this ,
he had mild elevation of his liver function tests.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Mr. Blackmer is A&amp;O x3 with a BP of
90/60 , heart rate of 84. His lungs are bilaterally clear. His
heart exam shows a regular S1 , S2. Faint S3 with a 1/6
holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with a JVD of 12 cm
plus V waves. His abdomen is benign. Extremities show no edema ,
but a left lower extremity petechial rash. He is found to be
heme positive with tarry stool , and he has a stable stage 4
sacral decubitus ulcer , well granulated without clear evidence of
infection.
Admission labs are significant for creatinine of 3.6 , BUN of 239 ,
potassium of 5.8 , digoxin of 1.7 , hematocrit of 29.3 , INR 4.1.
Admission EKG showed sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block.
Stable Q&apos;s in II , III , aVF , as well as V4 to V6. Left axis
deviation and right bundle branch block and an unchanged ST
depression in V2.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: 11/19/2005 , right heart
catheterization with PA line removal on 6/1/2005. 9/10/2005 ,
upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. 6/12/2005 , echocardiogram.
6/12/2005 , renal ultrasound.
HOSPPITAL COURSE:
1. Mr. Kristin presented with acute and chronic renal failure
with baseline BUN and creatinine at approximately 66/2.4 with a
rapid rise between presentation and the last noted value on
11/15/2005. Although , he was asymptomatic and did not have any
EKG changes , he was treated with Kayexalate and sodium
bicarbonate which resulted in rapid normalization of potassium.
The superelevation of his BUN was thought in part to be due to
possible over diuresis but also complicated by the fact that he
had Hemoccult positive stool as suspicious for a GI bleed as a
source of increased nitrogen. The renal service was consulted
and initial treatment of his acute renal failure included the
above plus removal of all fluid restriction and diuresis in order
to reverse any potential prerenal state. Essentially , all urine
and renal studies including eosinophils and renal ultrasound were
negative with a renal ultrasound showing normal kidneys without
hydronephrosis but without increased resistance in the feet
bilaterally. At the time of discharge , his creatinine and BUN
had fallen to 1.9/81 respectively and remained stable over days.
The initial renal diet restrictions imposed during the
hospitalization were removed towards the end of the stay with
persistently stable values as well.
2. From a cardiovascular standpoint , a repeat echo on 9/12
showed an EF of 35 to 40 with inferior wall and inferior septal
severe hypo to akinesis as well as posterior wall severe
hypokinesis with trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ mitral valve
regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid valve regurgitation but normal left
ventricular size and thickness as well as normal right
ventricular size function. In order to better assess his filling
pressures and fluid status and attempt to optimize his renal
function , Mr. Marthaler underwent a right heart cath with PA line
placement on 11/19/2005 which revealed elevating filling
pressures including right atrium at 26 to 27 , right ventricle
65/13 , PA 64/32 , wedge 36. Pulmonary artery sat 39% , SVR 1568 ,
and pulmonary vascular resistance 221. His cardiac output and
index were both reduced. The PA line was left in for tailor
therapy , and he was initially placed on nesiritide drip at 0.005
as well as a Lasix drip with good urine output and increase in
his cardiac output and index and decrease in his elevated
systemic vascular resistance. On 10/6/2005 , the nesiritide drip
was discontinued and Lasix continued with the addition of
short-acting nitrates in the form of Isordil. Eventually , he was
transferred from the Lasix drip to torsemide reaching optimal
dose of 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. on 2/10/2005 , and further tailoring
with Imdur 30 and hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for further
afterload reduction were preformed. Lisinopril previously used
on admission was continuously held given the recent acute renal
failure.
3. From an ischemic standpoint , there were no active issues
during the hospitalization. His beta blocker was reduced to 12.5
briefly , but his normal dose of 25 once a day was resumed prior
to discharge. In terms of his rate , it was well controlled on
the above regimen , but his rhythm showed frequent ectopy without
response to diuresis or beta blockade. He does have an ICD in
place which never fired during the course of the hospitalization.
Upon discharge , he was close to euvolemia with an approximate
discharge weight of 67.6 kg.
4. From a GI standpoint , his initial presentation included
heme-positive tarry stools with elevated BUN. He was seen by the
GI service and underwent a colonscopy and upper EGD which were
significant for gastritis without signs of active bleeding as
well as internal hemorrhoids. H. pylori serologies were
positive , and he was initially started on clarithromycin ,
amoxicillin , and Nexium b.i.d. , but this regimen was changed to
amoxicillin , Flagyl , and Nexium b.i.d. given an elevation of his
LFTs on the prior regimen. There was no overt GI bleeding , and
he tolerated the procedure without complication.
5. From a nutrition standpoint , Mr. Splatt was seen by a
nutrition specialist who confirmed suspicion of suboptimal
caloric intake meeting his total caloric needs about only 60% and
total protein needs are 85% despite labilization of his diet and
the addition of Megace. His nutritional goals were even more
important given his large stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer with
poor healing since January 2005. Despite encouragement and the
addition of appetite stimulants with vitamin C , zinc , mineral ,
multivitamins , and the addition of supplements , he presently fell
short of his goals but refused other means of diet
supplementation including NG tube placement and PEG placement and
is determined to provide adequate p.o. intake by mouth. He and
his family met with a registered dietitian and understand the
importance of his caloric intakes.
6. From a musculoskeletal point of view , he has stage 4 sacral
decubitus ulcer which is followed by plastic surgery and
frequently debrided as an outpatient , Dr. Bastress and his team ,
followed the patient while inhouse , and it was treated as per
protocol with b.i.d. dressing changes with Panafil and wet-to-dry
dressings. Initially , he was started on Keflex for suspicion of
infection in the wound , and this was changed to vancomycin given
MRSA growth in the wound and further Klebsiella growth which was
treated with levofloxacin , but these were all discontinued on
10/6/2005 as per plastic recommendations given the high
probability colonization. It was also felt that these
antibiotics would provide appropriate coverage for the possible
right lower lobe infiltrate questioned on x-ray.
7. From an endocrinology standpoint , he has a history of diabetes
type 2 , and he was continued on his Lantus and NovoLog insulin
sliding scale with titration of optimal glucose control in order
to promote wound healing. He was followed by the diabetes
management team.
8. From rheumatologic standpoint , he has a history of gout , and
he was maintained on allopurinol , renal dosing , but colchicine
helps. On about 1/6/2005 , he developed symptoms of podagra ,
and a prednisone taper starting at 15 mg was started with quick
resolution of symptoms.
9. From hematologic standpoint , he has anemia baseline and takes
Procrit once a week as an outpatient. He received 1 unit of
packed red blood cell transfusion on 8/18 and maintained his
hematocrit throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. He
was also maintained on darbepoetin as an inpatient.
Laboratory data showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normal
haptoglobin and LDH , but evidence of decreased iron saturation.
He was started on iron supplementation , and his Coumadin was held
for the supratherapeutic levels on admission and optimize prior
to discharge.
PERTINENT EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Patient was afebrile with stable
vital signs. He did have decreased breath sounds at the right
base know to correspond with his small right basilar opacity with
atelectasis. Other than that , his heart exam remained unchanged
with a regular rhythm , S1 and S2 , S3 , with a 1/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex. His JVD was 11 cm , and he had no peripheral
edema.
Discharge lab showed a creatinine of 1.9 with a BUN of 81 ,
potassium of 3.6 , hematocrit 32.1 , white blood cell count 9000.
His digoxin level was normal at 0.8 , and his INR was 3.
CONSULTATNTS: Dr. Bingaman from Ox Derd Peake , Dr. Crisan from GI , Dr.
Whidbee from plastic surgery , Armando Mishulovin from nutrition , as
well as the diabetic management service.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out myocardial infarction.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Peripheral vascular disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Glickson is a 59-year-old gentleman
with no known history of cardiac
disease who presented with substernal chest pain. Mr. Parshall was in
his usual state of health with known cardiac risk factors of
hypertension , peripheral vascular disease family history , and
history of smoking cigarettes who presented with steady course of
substernal chest pain beginning the day of admission. The patient
noted that after lunch he felt the left-sided chest pressure
described as crushing which was intermittent. He continued with
his activities during the day and went to a baseball game in the
evening and the symptoms continued and were then associated with
right shoulder and arm tingling and achiness. He left the game and
on the way home , he had increasing substernal chest pain rating
6-7/10 which was associated with perfuse diaphoresis. At that
point , the patient came to the Emergency Department. He denied
shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations. He had a
similar episode with a rule out MI two years ago at which time he
had a negative workup per patient report. He denied any orthopnea ,
PND , or peripheral edema as well as fevers or chills. Upon arrival
in the Emergency Department , the patient received sublingual
Nitroglycerin as well as Lopressor , Nitropaste , and Aspirin with
resolution of symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hiatal hernia.
2. Hypertension.
3. Peripheral vascular disease with claudication , noted worsening
over the past month , decreasing from 1 mile to inability to
do treadmill for any amount of time.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Nadolol 50 mg po qd.
2. Pepcid ac 1 bid.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is the owner of a furniture store. He is
married and lives with his wife. He admits to
1-1/2 pack per day of cigarettes for 45 years , but is currently
cutting down. He denies alcohol or intravenous drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father has a history of coronary artery
disease in his late 50s.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAM: In general , the patient was a well-appearing
elderly male in no acute distress. His heart rate
was 65-70 beats per minutes , blood pressure 140/90 , O2 saturation
96% on room air , and respiratory rate 16. HEENT exam was within
normal limits. The neck was supple with no JVD. The heart is
regular rate and rhythm without murmur or gallops , and positive S4.
The lungs were clear bilaterally. The abdomen was benign. The
extremities were with no edema. Neurological exam was grossly
nonfocal.
LABORATORY: The patient&apos;s CKA sed was 40 , CKB sed 33 , troponin 0 ,
cholesterol 265. Chest x-ray was negative. EKG
showed J point elevation in V1-V2 with no ST or T wave changes
compared with prior EKGs. He had a normal sinus rhythm at 62 with
normal intervals and a normal axis.
IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old gentleman with substernal
chest pain and symptoms , and multiple cardiac risk
factors who is admitted to the Short-Stay Unit for rule out
myocardial infarction protocol.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ruled out for
myocardial infarction with normal CK and EKG.
The patient had no further episodes of chest pain while in-house
and underwent a exercise stress test with arm ergometry secondary
to his history of claudication. The patient exercised 8 minutes
using ergometry and stopped secondary to fatigue. His maximum
blood pressure was 212/102 and maximum heart rate was 101. He had
no chest pain , no ST or T wave changes , and no evidence of ectopy.

Coags within normal limits. BNP 46 , CK-MB 0.9 , troponins
negative. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversions , V3
through V5. Chest x-ray shows enlarged heart with right middle
lobe opacity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary: The patient with possible right middle lobe
pneumonia versus CHF versus exacerbation versus COPD versus PE.
The patient is found to have pneumonia. She is afebrile with
normal white blood cell counts but continues to be hypoxic to the
mid 80s on room air. Sputum cultures were sent and the patient
was treated empirically with Levaquin. Levaquin was given for a
total of 8 doses in-house and the patient will continue for a
total of 14-day course. The patient had a PECT , which was
initially read was positive , however , the final read was negative
for PE. The patient initially received a dose of Lovenox 100 mg
b.i.d. but was discontinued given negative PE. The patient was
seen by Pulmonary Service who performed the bronchoscopy on
6/14/05 , which showed a copious blood-tinged mucosa and
collapsed right middle lobe lung with narrow orifice. Brushings
and cytology were taken and sent to Pathology and the results are
still pending. The patient&apos;s pulmonary function test showed
severe obstructive disease with the FEV of 0.9 with some aspects
of restrictive disease. She also underwent a bubble study , which
was negative for heart septal defects. The PA pressure was
estimated at 42. The patient then underwent a right heart
catheterization to check for vasodilator response and heart
function. This was performed on 10/10/05 , which showed high
right-sided heart pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure of
16-18 and suggested that the patient was not in acute left heart
failure. The patient was also seen by the Ookter Highway ,
Pulmonary Hypertension Consult Service , whose impressions were
that the patient&apos;s poor pulmonary function is due to COPD and
pectus cavernosum as well as radiation for breast cancer and is
chronic condition. No indication was present for treatment with
primary pulmonary antihypertensive agents. The patient then had
a repeat chest x-ray on 10/10/05 to evaluate for the right middle
lobe , which continues to be collapsed. The patient was stable on
2-3 L of nasal cannula oxygen , saturating at about middle 90s.
The patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy on 3/29/05 and
was found to not need any particular treatments at home. The
patient was discharged to home with home O2 2-3 nasal cannula and
instructed to keep O2 saturations above 88%. The patient does
work in the hospital. The patient&apos;s work situation and
disability regarding her lung condition was discussed by the
attending physician.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient is stable with no evidence of
acute CHF , complicating dyspnea. The BNP was normal and JVP
remained relatively flat throughout her hospital course. The
patient was continued on her outpatient hypertensive medications ,
which was captopril and that was given t.i.d. with good control.
The patient was also on Lasix 40 mg daily , which was then
increased to 60 on day of discharge to encourage gentle diuresis.
3. Endocrine: The patient has diet-controlled diabetes at home.
She was on insulin sliding scale and house and required only
several units of insulin a day. Her blood sugars remained in the
mid 100s.
The patient was on Levoxyl 225 mcg daily in-house and was found
to have a increased TSH of 10.5 , therefore dose of Levoxyl was
increased to 250 mcg. The patient is instructed to follow up
with her primary care provider and her endocrinologist in two
weeks to recheck a TSH.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complaining of leg cramps ,
chest spasms , and back pain. Back pain appears chronic. Chest
spasms appeared to be musculoskeletal in etiology and not
cardiac. The patient was on oxycodone 5 mg q.4h. p.r.n. and then
transitioned to OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with good pain control.
5. Social Services: The patient was seen by Social Services
regarding prescription coverage , ability to handle copayments.
Additionally , her concerns regarding short-term disability and
long-term disability for work were addressed. The patient is to
inquire with her benefit office to determine for services.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home O2.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Levaquin 500 mg daily for six more days ,
captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily ,
levothyroxine 250 mcg p.o. daily , Xanax 0.25 mg t.i.d. p.r.n. ,
OxyContin 10 mg p.o. q.12h. , Combivent 1-2 puffs q.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient to call if becoming short of
breath , has chest pain , fever over 100.5 or any other concerns or
questions.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: Include 10/17/05 at Bayhead Medical Center for
sleep study where the patient is to arrive before 09:00 p.m. that
night , 10/25/05 with Dr. Chesterman at 02:30 p.m. for primary care
follow-up , Dr. Hilse on 7/18/05 at 04:00 p.m. for follow-up of
pulmonary issues and a two weeks&apos; time follow-up with her
endocrinologist regarding her thyroid condition.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: COPD , pneumonia , secondary pulmonary hypertension ,
hypothyroidism , hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 49 year old lady was admitted
with increasing shortness of breath
and increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilated
cardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list.
Her history extends back to 1995 when she was fist admitted with
shortness of breath and an ejection fraction of 15% with 3+ mitral
regurgitation in a setting of excessive alcohol use. Her
cardioangiogram at that time showed right dominant system without
coronary artery disease and her exercise stress test revealed a VO2
of 12.6. The presumptive diagnosis at that time was alcoholic
relation dilatation cardiomyopathy. In 11/18 she represented with
an ejection fraction of 20% with moderate mitral regurgitation and
left atrial enlargement and she was treated with digoxin , diuretics
and ace inhibitors. It subsequently was revealed that there was a
strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact ,
subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosed
with dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore altered
from alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. In 10/22 she was
admitted with acute pancreatitis and developed acute renal failure
requiring intubation. Her stay was complicated by Staphylococcal
bacteremia. She recovered but presented again in 11/13 with a
history of progressive shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion ,
orthopnea , PND and abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting and
anorexia. She required dobutamine and IV Lasix and had an episode
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In 11/10 she presented
with syncope in the presence of a potassium of 2.4 and was
diagnosed with Torsades de Pointes in the setting of hypokalemia
and acute TC of 0.68. In 3/14 she represented with an ejection
fraction of 20% with a left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis and
required IV diuresis. In 3/26 she had a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy for multiple gallstones. In 1/20 she was admitted
for cardiac transplant evaluation and found to a VO2 of 9.2 , a DLCL
of 62% predicted and she was negative for PPD. She was admitted in
9/18 for IV diuresis and potassium repletion , and again in 5/12
with abdominal distention and orthopnea. Pancreatitis was ruled
out at that stage and she was again treated with IV Lasix. She
represented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heart
failure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril and
Zaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic support
for a short period of time.
On this admission she gives a history of two days of increased
shortness of breath with orthopnea and mild PND with diminished
exercise tolerance. She has been reluctant to combine torsemide
and her regular intravenous Lasix at home which was given to her by
the VNA and feeling increasingly shortness of breath she was taken
to the emergency department at Ield Hospital There she was
treated with 200 mg of IV Lasix and had a 1.2 liter diuresis , felt
better , and was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation
and management.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married with four children and she is
an ex-smoker for the last year , previously 10
cigarettes a day for life and previously a heavy drinker up to 1-2
liters of spirits per day.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above shows strong family history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , with her mother dying at the age
of 36 from a sudden cardiac death , her grandmother dying at the age
of 52 from what appears to have been cardiomyopathy , and two of her
brothers dying at the age of 32 and 42 with heart related problems.
Two of her sons as I mentioned were diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy , one of whom remains quite unwell.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg once a day; Diuril
500 mg once a day; digoxin 0.625 mg once
a day; Colace 100 mg twice a day; Aldactone 25 mg once a day;
Torsemide 100 mg in the morning , 15 mg in the p.m.; K-Dur 100 q.
a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Alert and oriented , in no
distress. She was comfortable. Evidence of
labored breathing. Her pulse was tachycardic at 103 with
respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 84/58. Her
temperature was 98.2. She had diminished radial pulses
bilaterally. She had borderline proptosis with a jugular venous
distention at the angle of the jaw. She had no bruits and no
thyromegaly. She had a loud S3 and S4 with a dynamic precordium
and a displaced PMI with a quiet MR. She had a palpable S4. Her
respiratory examination showed her lungs were markedly clear to
percussion and auscultation without wheeze. Abdomen was mildly
distended without evidence of shifting dullness. Bowel sounds were
normal. She had an inverted umbilicus. She had no peripheral
edema and good peripheral pulses.
Chest x-ray showed a large globular heart without fluid in the
bases with mild upper lobe venous diversion. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm with a left axis and ventricular
conduction defect and left ventricular hypertrophy high voltage.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 3.6 , white count 6.6 ,
hematocrit 37.9. Cardiac enzymes were normal. I
note her right catheterization results of 4/22/99 showed a mean
right atrial pressure of 12 , right ventricular pressure of 38/14 , a
mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21 with a cardiac index
of 2.88 , and a cardiac output of 4.93 and an SVO of 1022.
IMPRESSION: This was a 49 year old lady with dilated
cardiomyopathy , probably familial in nature , with
increased abdominal girth and shortness of breath , on the
transplant list , admitted for diuresis , plus or minus optimization
therapy.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was initially treated with b.i.d. Lasix 200
mg IV and had an excellent diuresis on this
regimen. We increased her Aldactone to 50 mg once a day to try and
obtain better potassium control and eventually we added metolazone
at 2.5 mg in the morning. During her admission she had a very
significant improvement with negative diuresis of almost 2 liters
every day for the past 3 days. She had a cortisol stimulation
tests which revealed normal synthetic adrenal function and she had
a normal TSH. She required extensive potassium repletion during
her stay and she is discharged on 120 total of K-Dur per day.
During her hospital stay her glucoses were over 250 for a short
period of time and it was felt that it was probably appropriate to
start her on oral hypoglycemics. However in the setting of
changing her diuretic medications and a hospital diet , this was
considered this could be delayed until her next outpatient visit
with Dr. Weigleb
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d.; amiodarone 200 mg
q.d.; digoxin 0.0625 mg q.d.; M.V.I.

CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: To home with VNA for Coumadin , potassium checks and
intravenous 200 mg of Lasix p.r.n.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow up with Dr. Pucket next Wednesday and
she will have her potassium checked tomorrow in the CMCO
laboratory , result of which will be forwarded to Dr. Gracia and any
necessary change to her K-Dur therapy will be managed therefrom.

SERVICE: GENERAL MEDICINE TEAM Fontpor Wood Vi
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. MORBID OBESITY.
BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 60-year-old African-American
female with a recent , eleven-day hospitalization at
the Brentcal Hospital for a congestive heart failure
flare. The patient presents now with two days of progressively
worsening shortness of breath at rehabilitation. The patient
presented initially with chest pain and CHF , and was ruled out for
a myocardial infarction , in early October . An echocardiogram then
revealed mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction and abnormal
septal motion , with septal apical hypokinesis and minimal mitral
regurgitation. An exercise treadmill test at that time was without
ischemia , though her target heart rate was not achieved. During
the hospitalization at that time , the patient was slowly diuresed
and then discharged to rehabilitation. At rehabilitation , she has
been chest-pain-free , but she has had increasing shortness of
breath and wheezing. In the emergency department , she was found to
be in congestive heart failure by chest x-ray. The oxygen
saturations were 93% on 2 liters. She was given albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers and IV Solu-Medrol , and was also given a dose
of 120 mg of IV Lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see the Problem List.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient has had the following
surgeries: ( 1 ) A cholecystectomy; ( 2 ) Two
Caesarean sections.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Ventolin two puffs p.o. q.i.d. ,
Azmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Rhinocort
two puffs b.i.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol
25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 75 mg
p.o. q.d. , Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
and nitroglycerin sublingually p.r.n.
LISTED ALLERGIES: Lisinopril gives her a cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use and no IV drug abuse.
The patient works in the Chand O Rock , Virginia 48456 at
the Ham Greatsilove Hospital .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the vital signs include the
following: the temperature is 98.0 degrees
F. , the pulse 87 , the blood pressure 180/110 , and the respirations
24. The oxygen saturation is 92% on 2 liters. In general , the
patient is a morbidly obese female in mild to moderate distress.
The neck is supple , without bruits; the jugular venous pressure
cannot be assessed secondary to the patient&apos;s body habitus. The
cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with an
S1 , an S2 , and an S3 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
right upper sternal border and a 2/6 murmur at the left upper
sternal border. Examination of the lungs is significant for rales
bilaterally in one-third of the lung fields. She also has
inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory
phase. The abdomen is soft , non-tender , and non-distended , with no
masses. The extremities show 2+ pitting edema in both lower
extremities and the pulses are 2+ in the dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial arteries. On neurological examination , the
patient is alert and oriented times four. The neurologic
examination is otherwise non-focal.
DATA BASE: The admission chest x-ray showed moderate congestive
heart failure with moderate pulmonary edema but no
acute infiltrate. The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 60 , a normal axis , and no ST-T wave changes when compared
to prior EKGs from October 2000. The admission laboratory studies
were as follows. The sodium was 140 , the potassium 4.0 , the
chloride 99 , the CO2 39 , the BUN 23 , the creatinine 0.9 , the
glucose 78 , the CK 114 , the troponin 0.00. The white count was
8 , 200 , the hematocrit 44 , and the platelets 315 , 000. The PT was
11.8 , the PTT 23.1. The cholesterol level was 206.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR. The patient was re-admitted to the Wakeview Hosp Of Valley with worsening congestive heart failure on a dose
of Lasix of 40 mg p.o. q.d. She received 120 mg IV Lasix in the
emergency department and her diuresis was continued with aggressive
intravenous Lasix until two days prior to discharge , when she was
switched to p.o. Lasix. She was started initially on 120 mg of IV
Lasix once a day , which resulted in a diuresis of 1-2 liters every
twenty-four-hour period. The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial enzymes and EKGs. The decision had been made
during the last hospitalization to manage her coronary artery
disease medically. The patient did not desire cardiac
catheterization at this point. She was eventually switched to oral
Lasix at a dose of 60 mg by mouth twice a day.
2. RESPIRATORY. The patient was admitted to the hospital for
congestive heart failure but also had evidence of reactive airway
disease on clinical examination. She had profound inspiratory and
expiratory wheezes and shortness of breath. Due to the history of
reactive airway disease , the patient was started on intravenous
Solu-Medrol , albuterol , Atrovent , and Serevent. She was given
supplemental O2 to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than
93%. She was continued on her IV steroids throughout the
hospitalization , and these were eventually switched to p.o.
prednisone near the end of the hospitalization and were to be
tapered on an outpatient basis. Her shortness of breath resolved
by the time of discharge.
3. FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES. Due to the aggressive diuresis , the
patient developed a contraction alkalosis during the course of
hospitalization. Her bicarbonate rose to a level of 43 , with a BUN
of 34. At this time , the diuresis was withdrawn slightly and the
patient&apos;s electrolytes normalized.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin with codeine 5 ml p.o. q.4h. ,
Atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg
sublingually p.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Serevent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Flovent 220 micrograms inhaled b.i.d. ,
Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d. , and a prednisone taper with 60 mg p.o.
q.d. for three days , then 50 mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 40
mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 30 mg p.o. q.d. for three days ,
then 20 mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 10 mg p.o. q.d. for three
days.

ATTENDING: RANDOLPH DAN OPHEIM MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman who was noted to have an
abnormal electrocardiogram during preoperative testing for his
right shoulder surgery. The patient underwent stress test , which
showed areas of ischemia. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on 8/28/04 which revealed a left anterior
descending coronary artery with an osteal 90% stenosis , the ramus
coronary artery with an ostial 70% stenosis , first diagonal
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis , a 3rd diagonal coronary
artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , left circumflex coronary
artery with a proximal 75% stenosis , right coronary artery with a
50% ostial stenosis , posterior descending coronary artery with a
proximal 90% stenosis , a right dominant circulation and right
renal artery stenosis of 75 80%. Echocardiogram on 4/6/04
revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral insufficiency ,
trivial tricuspid insufficiency , low normal to borderline reduced
overall left ventricular systolic function , not quantified. The
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation which was treated in
the past with propafenone which is currently resolved and he has
history of myocardial infarction. He also has a history of class
III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:

mellitus , dyslipidemia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
benign prostatic hypertrophy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ,
no known episodes since 1995 , nephrolithiasis , and bursitis of
his right shoulder. History of hepatitis type unknown and renal
artery stenosis and renal insufficiency. He is status post left
rotator cuff repair in 1991.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has allergies to procainamide which causes diarrhea
and arthralgias and verapamil which causes difficulty
concentrating and constipation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Toprol 25 mg once a day , lisinopril 10 mg once a day , propafenone
150 mg once a day enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once a day ,
Rhinocort , simvastatin 20 mg once a day , metformin 500 mg once a
day , and glyburide 5 mg twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or
heaves , peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally throughout.
Respiratory breath sounds clear bilaterally , is otherwise
noncontributory.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 10/19/04 where
he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5 with left
internal mammary to left anterior descending coronary artery
saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal coronary artery. A
right internal mammary artery to the ramus coronary artery , a
left radial artery to the second left ventricular branch and
sequential to the first left ventricular branch. Total bypass
time was 159 minutes , total cross clamp time 110 minutes. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and stable condition with intravenous insulin.
Postoperatively , the patient did show his atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter which was treated Lopressor , diltiazem ,
propafenone. He was extubated and placed on his preoperative
inhalers for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He did
have a left-sided pleural effusion which was tapped on 1100 cc of
bloody fluid on 3/26/04. Post-tap chest x-ray revealed a small
left residual effusion and no pneumothorax. The patient was
slightly hypertensive due to renal artery stenosis and initially
low urine output. Renal ultrasound revealed equal size kidneys
and no hydronephrosis. His oliguria was blood pressure dependent
and he did resume urination without use of diuretics. The
patient was also followed by the diabetes mellitus service for
his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was put back on
his preoperative dose of glipizide. The patient was transferred
to the step-down unit on postoperative day #6. He did complain
on 5/11/04 of left eye black spot in the middle of his left eye.
The patient was seen by the ophthalmology service which was felt
that this was due to his diabetic retinopathy. The patient will
follow up as an outpatient with his local ophthalmologist; his
symptoms have resolved. The patient required vigorous diuresis

Discharge Date: 2/28/1999
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. ISCHEMIC HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY.
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
3. ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Vomiting , fever , and chills for 18 hours prior to
admission and a cough.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year old
African-American female with a history
of long-standing alcohol abuse with two episodes of alcoholic
pancreatitis in the past. She is status post T2 , N1 floor of the
mouth squamous cell carcinoma. This was treated with resection and
XRT. She presents with vomiting x 18 hours. The patient was in
her usual state of health until two days prior to admission when
she began to develop upper respiratory infection symptoms with
congestion and a productive cough. The cough was initially
productive of white sputum and then later which turned dark in
color. She denies any blood tinged sputum or rust colored sputum.
The patient&apos;s cough and upper respiratory infection symptoms
progressed and she began to feel weak. On the morning prior to
admission , the patient awoke from sleep with a coughing fit and
subsequently vomited. She denies any hematemesis at that time.
She repeatedly had episodes of vomiting over the next 28 hours
prior to admission and was unable to drink liquids without
vomiting. She reports that she took approximately eight to ten
Tylenol 500 mg tablets prior to admission for her symptoms. She
became progressively light-headed and dizzy , especially with
standing up. She reports subjective fevers although she did not
take her temperature , and also night sweats. She had one episode
of diarrhea which was nonbloody and loose. Her son , who is an
employee of the Hos Medical Center cafeteria , went to
visit her and urged her to go to the emergency room.
In the emergency room , the patient was initially triaged to the
emergent side of the EW , was found to have a blood pressure of
77/50 with a pulse of 138. She was transferred to the acute side
for management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable of alcohol pancreatitis in September
of 1998 and April of 1997. 2. Squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck , as previously noted , status post
excision in 1994 with XRT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. She is
also status post multiple dental extractions and one flap revision.

one pint of brandy each day for &quot;a long time.&quot;
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per history of present illness. She denies
any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
lower extremity edema , chest pain , or shortness of breath. As far
as she knows , she has no known cardiac history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was relatively well-appearing in no
apparent distress. Her temperature was
98.0. Her blood pressure was 110/84 , her pulse was 101. Her
respiratory rate was 16 and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation; extraocular muscles intact; sclera were muddy
without icterus. Oropharynx was notable for postsurgical changes
on the right side and with dry mucous membranes. Neck: Notable
for no meningismus and jugular venous pressure of approximately 5
cm. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops , or rubs
auscultated and a nondisplaced point of maximal intensity.
Abdomen: Soft with mild left upper quadrant tenderness , but no
hepatic tenderness. The liver edge was nonpalpable. There was no
spleen tip palpable and bowel sounds were present. The extremities
were notable for no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and were warm and
perfuse. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented x 3 with
intact cranial nerve. Her strength and sensation were grossly
intact , 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. Her toes were
down-going bilaterally and her reflexes were symmetric in the upper
and lower extremities. Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
DATA: Laboratory values upon admission showed electrolytes within
normal limits. Magnesium was 1.1. White count 6.5 ,
hematocrit 48 , platelets 200. Differential: 78 polys , 1 band , 12
lymphs and 8 monos. MCV was 104. RDW was 14. ALT 140 , AST 605 ,
alkaline phosphatase 119 , and total bilirubin was 2.6 with a direct
fraction of 1.5. Lipase was 319 , amylase was 44. Her INRs were
1.1 and her prothrombin time was 19.9 Troponin was 0.22.
Chest x-ray was notable for no infiltrates or evidence of heart
failure.
EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia at 117 with a Q-wave of 3 and
Q-wave in V2 and V3. Q-wave inversions were noted in V3 and V6
with no chest pain.
Urinalysis was notable for 2+ protein , trace keto , 3+ blood , 2+
leukocyte esterase , 28 to 30 whites and 2+ squamous cells.
ASSESSMENT: In the emergency room , the patient was acutely treated
for presumed sepsis and received a dose of ceftriaxone
and clindamycin. Urinalysis results indicated that she had a
potential urinary tract infection at that time. Blood cultures
were drawn and the patient received IV hydration. Her EKG was
noted to have new T-wave inversions as compared to previously with
an indeterminate troponin. She was admitted to medicine for
management.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient&apos;s hospital course can be summarized
as follows:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient has no known cardiac history. Her
cardiac risk factors include cigarette smoking and postmenopausal
female , age 51. No diabetes mellitus. No known
hypercholesterolemia. No known family history. She does , however ,
drink heavily and has done so for a number of years. She has no
known cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol.
The T-wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin.
The patient was admitted in a rule out protocol. She ruled out for
an myocardial infarction with serial CKs which were all below 50.
Her T-wave inversions persisted despite resolution of her sinus
tachycardia. An echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated
dilated left ventricle of 5.6 cm and an ejection fraction of 25 to
30% with inferoseptal and inferoseptal apical akinesis. No
ventricular thrombus was noted.
Cardiology consultation service was asked to see the patient to
evaluation her in the setting of her new depressed ejection
fraction and focal wall motion abnormalities. Initially , she was
presumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silent
prior to this. She was treated with aspirin , Lopressor and
Captopril 6.25 mg three times a day. Unfortunately , the patient&apos;s
blood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and ,
despite efforts to scale it back in dosages , the majority of the
medicines were held. Nevertheless , the patient&apos;s heart rate slowed
to the 60s. She experienced one episode of burning chest pain on
the night of admission which was alleved with Maalox. There were
no EKG changes associated with that pain.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on September
The cardiac catheterization was notable for a right atrial
pressure of 5. Right ventricular pressure of 36/10. Pulmonary
artery pressure was 35/13 , and the pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 16. Her cardiac output was 6.13 with an index of
3.69. The left heart catheterization noted normal coronary
arteries without evidence of significant coronary disease. Her
left ventriculogram also noted a preserved ejection fraction with
no focal wall motion abnormalities. Dr. Garret Dalrymple of the
cardiac consultation service followed the patient in house and felt
that the reversal of her wall motion abnormalities could be
attributable to the acute effects of alcoholic cardiotoxicity. The
patient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention of
coronary disease , as her other medications were discontinued. The
patient was heparinized for her apical wall motion abnormality and
low ejection fraction while in house and the heparin was
discontinued at the time of catheterization.
2. GI: The patient presented with an acute elevation of her
transaminases. The patient&apos;s transaminases were noted to be less
than 10 in September of 1998. Initially , it was felt that these
transaminases might reflect alcoholic hepatitis given her
significant alcohol history. The patient reports that her last
drink was on Sunday prior to admission. She drinks about a pint of
brandy every day. The patient&apos;s transaminases continued to rise ,
however. The diagnosis of acute Tylenol toxicity superimposed upon
hepatocellular damage from alcoholic hepatitis was also
entertained. She was empirically started on naphthyl cystine and
received approximately two to three doses , however , that medication
was discontinued upon GI consultation. The patient&apos;s transaminases
rose to a level of approximately 4000 AST and 1000 ALT , and the GI
service was consulted. The patient&apos;s hepatitic serologies were
sent and were notable for positive hepatitis B core antigen ,
whereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis C ,
hepatitis A and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. The GI
service felt that her hepatocellular injury was most likely
attributable to an ischemic &quot;shock liver&quot; condition. She had a
right upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated a
dilatation of the common bile duct to 1 cm with some biliary
sludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions. Given the
patient&apos;s isolated increase in AST and ALT and bilirubin without an
increase in alkaline phosphatase , the diagnosis of ischemic
hepatotoxicity was entertained by the GI service. On the date of
discharge , the patient&apos;s ALT had fallen to 221 and her AST had
fallen to 50. Her total bilirubin had fallen to 1.1. The patient
was asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout her
hospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy or
asterixis. An isolated ammonia level was sent and it was 45.
3. Infectious disease: The patient had a repeat urinalysis that
was sent on the morning following admission which was indicative of
urinary tract infection. Urine culture eventually indicated an
infection with Enterococcus. The patient received seven days of
ampicillin while in house , following her initial first day dosing
of ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient&apos;s urinary tract
infection clear symptomatically. She developed a yeast infection
in her vulvar area secondary to antibiotic therapy and this was
treated with topical Nystatin. The patient was not discharged on
antibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection.
4. FVN: The patient had persistent hypomagnesemia while in house
and required significant magnesium repletion. The etiology of this
hypomagnesemia was unclear; however , it was attributable to her
chronic alcohol use and depletion of total magnesium stores. Her
electrolytes clearly need to be followed closely as an outpatient.
5. Hematologic: The patient&apos;s INR slightly increased while in
house but this is attributable to heparin bolus and
supratherapeutic prothrombin time. Upon discharge , the patient&apos;s
INR had normalized. She received vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days as
empiric treatment for vitamin K depletion secondary to chronic
alcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic synthetic
dysfunction.
6. Hypotension: The patient&apos;s initial presentation for
hypotension was attributable to dehydration; however , it became
clear that the patient normally exists with a low normal blood
pressure of approximately 80 to 100 systolic. It was stressed to
the patient that she must maintain adequate p.o. intake to maintain
her circulating blood volume , as she seemed to be intolerant to the
antihypotensive medicines that were used for cardioprotection. A
random cortisol was drawn and was normal. The issue of potential
renal insufficiency was most likely excluded. The patient will
follow-up on endocrine and electrolyte issues with her primary
doctor.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Nystatin
topical cream , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
multivitamin one q.day and aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Elroy Forcell in
MES GEERT MEDICAL CENTER on March . Dr. Aamodt was involved in the
patient&apos;s hospitalization and will provide excellent continuity of
care as an outpatient.

Mr. Lewter is a 65-year-old gentleman with history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
dyslipidemia , and peripheral vascular disease who presented to
Tci Prosamp Memorial Hospital on 5/23/06 with unstable angina. The patient
reports that he had been having intermittent left-sided chest
pressure at rest over the past three days associated with
shortness of breath , each episode lasting approximately 10
minutes. EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia with a new
incomplete left bundle-branch block and downsloping 1-1.5 mm ST
depressions in V3 through V6 and 1 mm depression in aVL. The
patient was deemed to have a NSTEMI and unstable angina. He was
not heparinized due to the fact that he was on Coumadin for
peripheral vascular disease with a therapeutic INR. On 11/26/06 , the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed the following: Left
circumflex coronary artery with an ostial 100% stenosis , left

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Jana was brought to the operating room on 3/26/06 where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery , a
sequential graft and a vein graft connecting from the aorta to
the second obtuse marginal coronary artery and then to the left
ventricular branch. Total bypass time was 55 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 46 minutes. The patient did well
intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought
to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable
condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. His CK-MB
trended down and EKG normalized. The patient&apos;s postop chest x-ray
revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary venous congestion bibasally
requiring vigorous pulmonary toilet. The patient was extubated on
1/5/06. The patient was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus
Service for his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. His
blood glucoses were well controlled. He was started back on his
oral medication of glipizide 5 mg and was covered with a NovoLog
sliding scale. The patient was transfused 3 units of packed red
blood cells postoperatively , and was re-started on Coumadin for his
peripheral vascular disease. The patient&apos;s platelet count
dropped to as low as 59 , 000. He had a HIT panel sent off which
came back negative and platelets trended up at time of discharge
to 143 , 000. Mr. Gier was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3. His pacing wires were removed , and he was
screened for rehabilitation for discharge. The patient also had
some urinary retention postoperatively and did require Foley

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
--HPI: Mr. Gump is a 77yo African American male with PMH notable for COPD ,
HTN , NIDDM and recent PNA who presented to SHH ED on 4/15/05 via EMS with a
CC of SOB x 3d. He was seen 2 days earlier at the Dis.ry Medical Center where he
was diagosed with pneumonia and given Azithromycin. The day of admissio
he said his breathing felt more labored and he contacted EMS to take him to
the CHA ED. He also reported worsening exercise tolerance and an increase
in bilateral lower extremity edema over the past few months , accompanied by
a 20lb weight gain. He also noted left sided pleuritic pain made worse by
physical movement and deep breathing. He was treated in the ED with
supplemental O2 and Levofloxacin and admitted with a diagnosis of COPD flare
and right heart failure.

--Hospital course:
1. ) Pulm- Pt treated for COPD flare with supplemental O2 , DuoNebs , and
steroids. Since he reported left sided pleuritic chest pain , we evaluated
the possibility of PE with a V/Q scan that reported a low probability of PE.
2. ) CV- Pt&apos;s physical exam demonstrated signs of right-sided heart failure ,
notably 12 cm JVD , hepatomegaly and later hepatojugular reflex , and 2+
bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. We proceeded to treat his heart
failure by diuresis with Lasix , initially PO and then IV. Overall , he
diuresed approximately 1L fluid. To further evaluate his heart failure , a
cardiac MRI was obtained and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and
function. His LVEF was 73% and he had no valvular dysfunction.
3. ) ID- Sputum was cultured which showed few polys , moderate cocci , 2+
suspected oral flora. Since he remained afebrile and did not demonstrate an
elevated WBC , we did not treat with antibiotics.
4. ) Endo- His diabetes was managed with his home regimen of Novolog.
Steroids may have contributed to his elevated blood sugars. In a previous
discharge summary , it was noted that he had an elevated TSH level. We
followed up on this by rechecking his TSH , which was normal.
5. ) Renal- He an elevated baseline level of Cr. We monitored his Cr and
BUN for an increase with diuresis. While the BUN increased to the low 30s ,
his Cr was stable.
6. ) Prophylaxis- Chronic pain and insomnia were managed with his out-pt
regimen of morphine and oxycodone. He was given Elavil for sleep. Because
of his history of cancer , he was placed on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please use your home oxygen when you are sleeping at night. We have added
combivent inhalers and a steroid taper to your medicines. Please stop the
hydrochlorathiazide ( hctz ) 25mg. Instead you will be taking lasix 20mg
once a day.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
- Continue Lasix 40mg PO QD at home and D/C home HTCZ.
- Slow Prednisone taper over next 20 days.
- Have PCP address management of HTN medications and OSA. Check lytes on
new dose of lasix. Consider adding ACE inhibitor considering hx of NIDDM.
Episodic hypoxia while sleeping may contribute to pulmonary HTN and signs
of right heart failure observed.

Discharge Date: 5/16/1998
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
3 ) PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year-old woman who
had coronary artery bypass graft in
1993 who presents with ten minutes of acute chest pain today. In
August of 1992 , she had quadruple bypass surgery with LIMA to the
LAD and saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM2 and diagonal branch.
She was feeling generally well until the beginning of April at
home. From June , 1997 to January , 1997 , she was in
O and began to experience intermittent episodes of diaphoresis.
These tended to occur with ambulation on a flat surface , although
she did have one episode that awakened her from sleep. The second
time this happened , she went to the Faxtpaul Dekan Health Care there in Ton
with the complaints of diaphoresis and some nausea , although she
did not have chest pain , shortness of breath , vomiting or
palpitations. No EKG was done at the time. She said that she was
definitely more comfortable lying or sitting than standing. It is
of note that she had had her Beta blocker , Pendalol decreased from
5 mg to 2.5 mg prior to this trip to Glension Street On return to the
Gene Er Za , she had upper respiratory and pharyngeal symptoms
with low grade fevers and a cough productive of a green sputum.
This was treated with Amoxicillin given to her by her son who is a
pharmacist. These symptoms gradually resolved and she saw Dr.
Jessie on March , 1997 and was given a clean bill of health.
At this visit , he did start her on Prinivil. Since she had been
home from Er Dr. , Win Ca S , she really had not had repeat episodes of
diaphoresis. Then on the day of admission when she went shopping
and had a recurrent episode of diaphoresis while carrying bags ,
this time with substernal chest pain that radiated down both arms.
She also had a general sense of heaviness across her chest. She
drove home and took a sublingual nitroglycerin that completely
resolved her pain. She describes this pain as exactly like the
anginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypass
graft. The total duration of this episode was approximately ten
minutes. By the time she presented to the Emergency Room , she had
no diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal.
The latest echocardiogram in April of 1997 showed an ejection
fraction of 35% with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis and
inferior akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. In July of
1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerance
test with Thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversible
defects.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
coronary artery bypass graft with cardiac
risk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol ,
hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history of
cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Zocor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 2 ) Prinivil
5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Pendalol 2.5 mg
p.o. q. day. 4 ) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Synthroid 0.100
mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday and Friday and 0.12 mg p.o. Tuesday ,
Thursday , Saturday and Sunday. 6 ) Pepcid p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Full Quer Dienson with her husband and
has two married sons. She does not smoke and
drinks wine occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 58
and her brother had a coronary artery bypass graft
at age 79 and she has a sister with Alzheimer&apos;s disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , elderly woman in
no apparent distress. Vital signs:
Temperature 99.4 degrees , heart rate 87 , blood pressure 115/78 ,
respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The rest
of the physical examination was significant for a clear oropharynx.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular
examination was regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 and a two out of
six systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with
no gallop or rub. Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema. Neurological examination was
non-focal. Rectal examination was guaiac negative with no masses.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood
cell count of 5.46 , hematocrit 40.1 , platelets 190.
Cardiac Troponin I was 0.0. CK was 102. Urinalysis was negative.
Chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm with normal intervals and normal axis with a left bundle
branch block pattern and first degree atrioventricular block with
no change compared to an EKG done on March , 1997.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this is a
woman with known coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstable
angina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and now
substernal chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
On April , 1998 , she had a standard Bruce exercise tolerance
test in which she went 3 minutes , 30 seconds and stopped because of
chest pain. This was typical of anginal pain and resolved eight
minutes into recovery. The EKG had no changes with a left bundle
branch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistent
with but not diagnostic of ischemia. She subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her known
underlying native disease. Her right atrial pressure was 4 , right
ventricular 46/8 , PA 42/22 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 19.
From here , she was managed medically with increases in her ACE
inhibitor , Statin and the addition of nitrates. After the cardiac
catheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at the
puncture site and a bruit was noted. An ultrasound was done that
revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the common femoral artery. She was
followed by Vascular Surgery and on May , 1998 , had a
follow-up ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a
pseudoaneurysm in her common femoral artery measuring 2 X 1.5 cm
surrounded by a large hematoma. On May , 1998 , the patient
underwent surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm without any
complications and she was discharged on March , 1998 with
follow-up with both Dr. Polito of Vascular Surgery and Dr. Khat ,
her cardiologist.

Discharge Date: 1/9/2005
ATTENDING: MCENTEGART , JOSE M.D.
SERVICE: Ho Ment Ton
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Cardiomyopathy , coronary artery disease.
PROBLEM LIST AND DIAGNOSIS:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old woman
with morbid obesity ( greater than 330 pounds ) , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus who presents with one week of increasing
dyspnea on exertion. She notes that she can no longer walk from
room to room without resting and she used to be able to walk
around her house. She also notes a frequent need to &quot;get air&quot;
which also wakes her from sleep. She often opens the window ,
turns on the air conditioning , etc. when she feels short of
breath. She started sleeping on two pillows over the past few
weeks. She also reports an intermittent increase in her leg
swelling and a cough productive of scant clear to whitish sputum.
She was unable to name her home medications , but stated that she
took four medications plus insulin which is in accordance with
her LMR notes. She has not been able to check her fingerstick
blood glucose levels recently because her machine has been
broken. She denies chest pain , tightness except with coughing.
She denies pleuritic pain , any recent illness , any sick contacts ,
any change in urinary or bowel habits , any nausea or vomiting ,
night sweats , diaphoresis or pain in her jaw or arms. Of note ,
her GIES HEALTH primary care physician , Dr. Miquel Crayford , note from
September 2004 noted tachycardia greater than 100 with decreased
exercise tolerance , inability to lie flat , and snoring and
daytime sleepiness. At this time , an echocardiogram performed in
January 2004 revealed an EF of 60 to 65% , trace PR and no regional
wall motion abnormality.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension. Bilateral
DVTs in 1972. The patient is not currently on anticoagulation.
She was on Coumadin for one year following this event.
Dysfunctional vaginal bleeding. Fibroids. Type II diabetes
mellitus. Morbid obesity. Pituitary microadenoma.
HOME MEDICATIONS: ( Per LMR - the patient confirms these as best
she can recollect ).
1. HCTZ 25 mg daily.
2. Glucophage 500 mg PO b.i.d.
3. NPH insulin 60 q.a.m. , 20 q.p.m.
4. Lisinopril 40 mg.
5. Iron supplements.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco use , alcohol use ,
drugs. She lives with her daughter who is one of her four
children , and eight of her 14 grandchildren in Otteba
She does not work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus. No known MI&apos;s.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.8. Heart rate
137 , down to 98 with 5 mg of IV Lopressor in the Emergency
Department. Blood pressure 156/98 , satting 95% on room air. In
general , the patient is an obese , pleasant woman in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Extraocular muscles are intact. Mucous
membranes moist. No JVD. Cardiovascular exam reveals
tachycardia , S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops but heart
sounds are distant and difficult to assess. Lungs: Decreased
breath sounds throughout secondary to body habitus , but no
crackles or wheeze noted. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended. Extremities warm and well perfused. Bilateral
pitting edema to shins. Derm: No ulcers or lesions.
Hyperpigmentation noted around neck and under breasts. GU exam:
Very trace guaiac positive stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY RESULTS: Notable for a blood glucose of
190 , BNP of 271 , and hematocrit of 32. ??_____?? EKG: Sinus
tachycardia at 118 with no ST or T-wave abnormalities. Chest
x-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. No
infiltrate. PE protocol CT ruled out central PE and showed a
small right pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had cycled electrocardiograms and
biomarkers. These were negative for myocardial ischemia or any
acute change. The patient was maintained on aspirin , Lipitor 80
mg , beta-blocker , and ACE inhibitor. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 8/10/05 which revealed a 50% LAD
lesion , a 70% D1 lesion. These lesions were not intervened upon
at the time of dictation. This patient is awaiting viability
study.
Pump: The patient underwent echocardiography on 5/19/05. The
findings of that study were very concerning revealing ejection
fraction of 20 to 25% , sharply decreased from EF of 60 to 65% in
January 2004. In addition , the study revealed global hypokinesis
with septal akinesis.
Rhythm: The patient has remained tachycardic and has been
monitored on tele with no noted abnormalities. On the night of
8/10/05 following cardiac catheterization , the patient had a 13
beat run of nonsustained V. tach on telemetry. She received
electrolyte optimization and close monitoring. Following this
episode , the patient&apos;s cycled cardiac biomarkers revealed a
troponin of 7.25 , MB fraction of 31 , CK of 283. As noted above ,
she will undergo cardiac viability study on 4/30/05 and may
receive evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
2. Pulmonary: The patient&apos;s initial presentation was suspicious
for pulmonary embolism given her distant past medical history of
DVT&apos;s. However , when she was admitted , she exhibited only
tachycardia without evidence of tachypnea or hypoxia and her
clinical course thus far , as well as her PE protocol CT is not
suggestive of this diagnosis. She has had a minimal oxygen
requirement over the course of her hospital stay. She does
experience dyspnea on exertion , however , has not been hypoxic at
any point.
3. Endocrine: TSH was normal. The patient was continued on her
oral hypoglycemic as well as an adjusted insulin regimen which
will be further altered prior to the patient&apos;s discharge. In
addition , she will be discharged with a prescription for a new
blood glucose monitor. Her last hemoglobin A1c check was close
to 12. Given her concerning findings of coronary artery disease ,
she will need to maintain much tighter control of her blood
glucose in the future. At the time of dictation , the patient is
being maintained on scheduled NPH as well as regular insulin
sliding scale.
4. Hematologic: Baseline anemia with admission hematocrit
improved from prior infectious diseases. The patient&apos;s
productive cough was thought to be not due to infection. The
patient has remained afebrile with normal white blood cell count
over the course of her hospital stay.
The remainder of this patient&apos;s hospital course and her discharge
medications will be dictated in a future addendum.

Discharge Date: 10/15/2005
ATTENDING: WUITSCHICK , LEROY M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Heart failure.
LISTS OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Status post cardiac transplant
in 1993 , obesity , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline of creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B , hypertension ,
osteoporosis , status post L3 compression fracture , status post
left hip fracture with replacement in September 2005 , complicated by
infection necessitating removal , debridement , and deconditioning.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Halnon is a 67-year-old
female with multiple medical comorbidities and a past medical
history significant for cardiac transplant in 1993 , and hip
replacement in September 2005 , complicated by wound infection , and need
for prolonged rehabilitation who presented from Port Medical Center to Ephma Mersources Ni Memorial Hospital with three days of
progressive worsening shortness of breath. Her chest x-ray was
consistent with congestive heart failure , and she was transferred
to Ckmond Kinga Quinaualv Medical Center with the request of her daughter
for further management of her heart failure. Here , her mental
status was borderline upon admission , but it improved with
discontinuation of standing analgesic and decreasing of her
clonazepam. A head CT showed no acute processes. She had a
right upper arm cellulitis and urinary tract infection on
screening urinalysis. She was anemic. She was found to be
vancomycin resistant Enterococcus positive , but repeated cultures
demonstrated MRSA negative. Her inpatient issues included
management of her heart failure , right upper extremity
cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia , diabetes ,
and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics.
ALLERGIES: She had allergies to penicillin and codeine , but the
reactions are unknown.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Vitamin C , Imuran , PhosLo , iron
sulfate , Deltasone , Coumadin , Aranesp , Dilaudid for pain ,
lactulose , Reglan , Sarna topical , Senokot , Ambien for sleep ,
miconazole powder , cyclosporine , Celexa , and Lasix 80 mg once per
day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile. Her blood pressure was
130/57 , and her pulse 120 in sinus tachycardia. She was 95%
saturated on 3 liters. Physical exam was significant for
bibasilar crackles in her lungs. 2+ edema in her legs to her
knees. A 5 cm x 5 cm area of warm erythema in her right upper
extremity and a left hip wound with packing in place granulation
tissue.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CT of her head , which showed no acute
processes. Echocardiogram of her heart showed an ejection
fraction of 55%. Normal right ventricle and structure with mild
to moderately reduced systolic function in her right ventricle.
Moderately dilated left atrium , moderately dilated right atrium ,
normal aortic valve , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and
structurally normal tricuspid valve. Right upper arm ultrasound ,
which showed no evidence of venous obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Ms. Gockley &apos;s inpatient issues
included management of her heart failure , right upper arm
extremity cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia ,
diabetes and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics. For her heart
failure , she was diuresed with IV and transitioned to oral
torsemide and they entered discharge dose of torsemide 200 mg
p.o. twice per day. Her admission weight was 133 kg and her
discharge weight 122 kg. She should continue on her current
torsemide and limit her daily salt intake , and restrict herself
to 2 liters per day for her right upper extremity cellulitis.
She was given a five-day course of levofloxacin ( used to address
recurrent UTI ) and then a two-day course of Ancef , her cellulitis
cleared with this regimen. For her urinary tract infection , she
was initially treated with levofloxacin and transitioned to
Bactrim based on antibiogram sensitivities. A long-term Foley
catheter was removed. Repeat cultures showed bacteria in her
urine; however , she was clinically asymptomatic , it was felt that
this is more consistent with colonization and no further
treatment was instituted. If needed for further antibiotics , a
PICC line was placed on May , 2005 , after her prior PICC
line clotted. Prior to discharge , a new Foley catheter was
placed and she was incontinent of urine and overall more
comfortable with catheter in place. While on Bactrim for her
UTI , her creatinine rose to a peak of 2.0 , it was unclear whether
this raise was due to diuresis or the antibiotic. With cessation
of the antibiotic , her creatinine trended downward to her
baseline at 1.6. For her chronic anemia , the patient was
continued on iron ( which was increased to three times per day )
and darbepoetin , folate was added. She was asymptomatic from her
chronic anemia. She was given two units of packed red blood
cells in May , 2005 , and two more units on February ,
2005 , and she responded appropriately to this. Her discharge
hematocrit was 30. Her hip was evaluated by orthopedics. They
felt her hip was healing well. She should be continued on
wet-to-dry dressings. No further orthopedic intervention is
planned. She can bear her full weight on her hip. At discharge ,
the patient was hemodynamically stable , afebrile , and breathing
comfortably on three liters of oxygen. She was discharged to
Naor Viewmor Hospital and should work aggressively towards
reconditioning.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vitamin C 500 mg twice per day , Imuran 25
mg daily , PhosLo 667 mg three times per day , clonazepam 0.25 mg
twice per day , cyclosporine 50 mg twice daily , Colace 100 mg
twice daily , iron sulfate 325 mg three times per day , folate 1 mg
daily , Dilaudid 2 mg every six hours as needed for pain , please
hold this sedated for respirations less than 10 per minute ,
insulin NPH 14 units every evening , insulin NPH 46 units every
morning , lactulose 30 mL four times per day as needed for
constipation , prednisone 5 mg every morning , Sarna topical every
day apply to affected areas , multivitamin daily , Coumadin 2.5 mg
daily , goal INR 2 to 3 , zinc sulfate 220 mg daily , Ambien 5 mg

Discharge Date: 4/9/2005
ATTENDING: SATERFIELD , JAYSON D.
MEDICAL SERVICE:
Milbrown Ae A
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
Acute renal failure , anemia.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , family history of CAD , degenerative joint disease ,
depression , obstructive sleep apnea , pulmonary hypertension and
morbid obesity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 60-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of
hypertension , obstructive sleep apnea , degenerative joint
disease , and recent falls , now in rehab since 7/18 , most
recently at Stusem Memorial Hospital , who presented with acute renal failure
found on routine labs , the morning of admission. The creatinine
was 3.6 on admission up from 1 in 6/29 and up from 2.2 in 6/8
BUN was elevated at 96. Labs were also notable for hematocrit
of 24 down from a baseline of 44 in 2001. The patient reports
being told that she had chronic kidney disease during an
admission to SITMH in 7/18 , attributed to heavy NSAID use in the
setting of degenerative joint disease. The patient stopped using
NSAIDs in 6/8 Prior to September , she reports decreased p.o. intake
in the setting of feeling like she was retaining fluid. Today ,
she complains of diffuse swelling and increased shortness of
breath x2-3 weeks. Denies chest pain , orthopnea or PND. Also ,
reports dysuria in the setting of indwelling Foley since 6/8
Denies fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , no melena
or bright red blood per rectum in the last six months but reports
melena and bright red blood per rectum intermittently in 2003 in
the setting of colonoscopy that was positive for diverticula.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient was afebrile with a heart rate ranging from 60-90 ,
systolic blood pressure of 120-140 , respiratory rate of 18 , she
was satting 95% on 2-4 liters. The patient was obese nonmobile ,
alert and oriented x3 and in no apparent distress. Pupils were
equal round and reactive to light. Sclerae were anicteric. She
had no conjunctival pallor. JVP could not be assessed due to
body habitus. She had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and
S2. She had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur audible at the left
upper sternal border. Lungs were notable for crackles at the
left base on anterior lung exam , they were otherwise clear. Her
abdomen was obese , she had positive bowel sound. It was soft ,
nondistended and nontender. Extremities were warm and well
perfused. She had 2+ pitting edema to the knee bilaterally.
Pertinent lab results as mentioned in the HPI.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES DURING THE ADMISSION:
1/13/05 creation of left arm AV fistula; 7/7/05 EGD.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
In summary , this is a 60-year-old morbidly obese woman who
presented with acute and chronic renal failure and anemia.
PROBLEM:
1. Renal: Renal failure initially thought to be secondary to
prerenal etiology in the setting of elevated BUN/creatinine ratio
and FENA less than 1% in the setting of Lasix and FEBUN of 19%
and because of the presence of abundant granular casts. ATN also
possibility but urine sodium was 29. Postrenal etiology was
ruled out with a renal ultrasound without evidence of
hydronephrosis. The patient was aggressively hydrated once
outside hospital records confirmed an ejection fraction of 60%.
However , the patient initially appeared to fail volume challenge
with no acute change in creatinine past 3.2 from 10/18/05 to
4/20/05. At that time , Vascular Surgery was consulted for AV
fistula placement in the setting of GFR of approximately 17 that
was not improving. AV fistula was placed on 1/13/05 in the left
arm without complication. Renal function was waxing and waning
throughout hospital course with creatinine at time of discharge
of 3.1. Daily urine output usually approximately 600-700 mL.
All diuretics and ACE inhibitor was held throughout hospital
course and blood pressure well controlled. The patient should
not be restarted on these medications because it will precipitate
worsening kidney failure.
2. GI: Colonoscopy in 2001/2003 notable for diverticula. Stool
was guaiac throughout hospital course and generally guaiac
positive brown stool. Hematocrit did not bump appropriately
after transfusion of 4 units. It went from 23.3-30. GI was
consulted in this setting and plans were made for EGD and
colonoscopy to look for a source of GI bleed. Both procedures
were scheduled in OR and attempted on 2/22/05. EGD successfully
performed with evidence of gastritis , nonbleeding ulcer , and
duodenal mass with gastric heterotopia. H. pylori stool antigen
and H. pylori biopsies negative. Patient continued on Nexium 40
mg daily. Colonoscopy not obtained unable to get past the rectum
in the setting of required general anesthesia/ETT in patient&apos;s
thighs.
3. Cardiovascular/Pump - ECHO with EF equal to 65% here ,
moderate diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
hypertension. No rhythm or ischemia issues during hospital
course , low HDL , started on statin.
4. Heme/normocytic anemia , likely secondary to GI bleed with
evidence of iron deficiency. Iron stores repleted with IV iron ,
also possible anemia in setting of low EPO. EPO level checked
low and normal , may ultimately benefit from Epogen. On Coumadin
for DVT prophylaxis/paroxysmal a-fib prior to arrival.
Supratherapeutic on admission , so Coumadin held in the setting of
GI bleed until INR 1.5 , then patient was covered with
subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. However , acute drop in
platelets in the setting of heparin from the 200s to the 30s , so
heparin stopped. PF4 antibody negative x1 and borderline x1.
PF4 antibody pending at the time of discharge , but all heparin
products including flush is held. The patient restarted on
Coumadin after EGD at 12.5 mg a day. Status post three doses ,
INR was 2. Target INR is 2-2.5 and the patient will be followed
at the Tarbripin Of Anticoagulation Clinic , phone
number is 915-360-5305. INRs can be faxed to clinic from rehab
and adjustments in doses can be made accordingly.
5. Endo: TSH within normal limits. Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 , so no
evidence of diabetes.
6. ID: UTI/proteus , levofloxacin renally dosed. Repeat urine
dirty , so p.o. Cipro started for empiric treatment of UTI in
setting of indwelling Foley. Two days prior to discharge , the
patient with low-grade temp to max 100.4. Chest x-ray unchanged
but only portable chest x-ray was obtained due to patient&apos;s
immobility , blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
Empirically treating for nosocomial pneumonia with p.o.
levo/cefpodox/azithro x10 days , PICC line in place at time of
discharge. However , it should be discontinued by 11/19/05 to
prevent infection.
7. Allergy: Postnasal drip. Rhinorrhea. Continued Claritin
and Flonase.
8. Psyche: Zoloft continued for depression.
9. Pulmonary: Intermittent , the patient intermittently
desaturates on room air to 80s but always resolved with
repositioning and O2. Likely secondary to respiratory muscle
deconditioning and to restrictive lung disease in the setting of
morbid obesity. Continuing Flovent for asthma and albuterol nebs
p.r.n. for wheezing. Continue CPAP at night for obstructive
sleep apnea.
10. Oncology: History of breast mass last evaluated in 4/20 at
which time the risk of surgery would determine to be greater than
the possible risk of breast cancer. Oncology not able to see
patient during inpatient stay but will schedule outpatient
followup regarding the issue of possible treatment with
tamoxifen.
11. FEN: Gentle bowel regimen , renal diet.
CODE STATUS:
Full.
KEY FEATURES OF PHYSICAL EXAM AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Essentially unchanged from admission.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Include Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. , albuterol nebulizer 2.5
mg inhaled q.6h. p.r.n. for shortness of breath and wheezing ,
ECASA 81 mg p.o. daily , PhosLo 667 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Catapres 0.1

Discharge Date: 7/25/2005
ATTENDING: WATERSTON , JIM K.
The patient was admitted to the Sa Medical Center .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Lower GI bleed.
LIST OF DIAGNOSES:
The patient has a history of diverticulosis for which she had a
colectomy approximately 30 years ago , high blood pressure ,
gastroesophageal reflux , hypothyroidism , supraventricular
tachycardia , and mitral valve prolapse.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 76-year-old female admitted from Stormmen&apos;slou Memorial Hospital
with a lower GI bleed. She was on the Medicine Service and got a
tagged red blood cell can in that angiography with embolization
of the middle colic artery , but she continued to rebleed. She
had a second angiography procedure , which did not show any
source , but continued to bleed. She had large amounts of red
blood clot and a low blood pressure , so she was taken to the
operating room for a colectomy and ileostomy. The case was
technically very difficult due to the adhesions. The initial
incision was performed through the incision from her previous
colectomy. She also had an open cholecystectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As above.
MEDICATIONS:
The patient takes Protonix , atenolol , levothyroxine , and
dalteparin.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
The patient had a hysterectomy and cholecystectomy.
ALLERGIES:
Allergic to tramadol , Celebrex , Neurontin , and tolterodine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Blood pressure 114/62 , heart rate at 78 , respirations 20 , and
saturating 96% on room air. General: The patient is in no acute
distress. Cardiovascular exam: The patient had regular rate ,
normal rhythm , with an audible murmur. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds ,
midline surgical scar , nontender to palpation , nondistended.
Rectal exam: The patient has external hemorrhoids. The patient
is guaiac positive.
INITIAL LABORATORY STUDIES:

Discharge Date: 7/28/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APPENDICITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: GRAVES&apos; DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35-year-old woman
with a history of Graves&apos; disease and
known cholelithiasis who presented to the Leadreid Hospital Emergency Room with a 12 hour history of increasing right
upper quadrant and right lower quadrant abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting and a fever. She had one normal bowel movement on the day
of admission. She denied pyuria , anorexia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Graves&apos; disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS: On
admission included , 10 mg po b.i.d.; Inderal , 40 mg po
b.i.d. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. HABITS: Negative
smoking history. No alcohol intake.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an ill appearing
female in moderate distress. Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a regular
rate and rhythm. Abdomen was soft , nondistended , right lower
quadrant and right upper quadrant tenderness , lower greater than
upper , positive bowel sounds , negative Murphy&apos;s sign. No shake or
peritoneal signs. Rectal exam revealed normal tone , no masses ,
nontender , no stool in vault.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a white blood cell
count of 14.33. Hematocrit 36.3. Urinalysis
revealed 15-20 red cells.
PROCEDURES: EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.
APPENDECTOMY.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor. There ,
she had a temperature of 102.2 and a pulse of
152. She continued to experience right upper and right lower
quadrant pain , lower greater than upper. Because of a known
cholelithiasis , differential of her right sided abdominal pain
included , primarily , cholecystitis and appendicitis. She thus
underwent abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound revealed right upper
quadrant gallbladder with mildly thickened walls , gallstones , but
no common duct dilatation or pericholecystic fluid. The right
lower quadrant revealed thickened small bowel walls but peristalsis
was also identifiable. Using the ultrasound probe , the right lower
quadrant was certainly more tender than the right upper quadrant.
On serial examinations , her abdominal pain and tenderness became
gradually worse and her temperature continued to remain high
spiking to 101 to 102. She was thus brought to the Operating Room
for an exploratory laparotomy. A paramedian incision was made and
appendicitis noted. The gallbladder appeared grossly normal. She
tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
Postoperatively , she continued to have high temperature spiking
over 103 degrees. She also became tachycardic to approximately
150. Because she had not been taking her medications for a few
days preoperatively as well as because she had tremor ,
hyperreflexia , fever , and tachycardia she was suspected to be
thyrotoxic. Of note , she had been in atrial fibrillation one month
prior to admission. Endocrinology consult was obtained and based
on their recommendations , she was restarted on , 15 mg po q
six hours; Inderal , 40 mg po q six hours; SSKI , one-third of 1 cc
po t.i.d. Thyroid function tests were sent. She gradually
defervesced. Her heart rate diminished and her ambulation was
rapidly advanced. Her wound was noted to be slightly erythematous
and she was thus started on Velosef.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Percocet , one
to two tablets po q four hours p.r.n.; Inderal , 40 mg
po q six hours; SSKI , one-third cc po t.i.d.; , 10 mg po
t.i.d.; Velosef , 500 mg po q.i.d. times seven days.

Discharge Date: 2/29/1994
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. End stage renal disease on chronic
hemodialysis. 2. Mild mental retardation.
3. Movement disorder ( tics ). 4. Status post parathyroidectomy.
5. Partial thyroidectomy. 6. Status post partial gastrectomy for
peptic ulcer disease. 7. History of MRSA from wound in 1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-old
gentleman with end stage renal disease
on chronic hemodialysis who was admitted status post fall and
seizure. The patient&apos;s end stage renal disease is thought to be
secondary to hypertension , although he has never had a renal
biopsy. He has been on hemodialysis since 1987 , having dialysis
three times a week. His dry weight is about 85 to 86 kilos. His
dialysis has been complicated by multiple episodes in the past of
hypotension and seizure activity occurring after dialysis. These
episodes occur about once a month.
On the day of admission , the patient came home from routine
hemodialysis where he was ultrafiltered 5.5 kilograms of fluid and
his final blood pressure after dialysis was 100/60. At noon , the
patient went home , ate lunch and went up to his room. At that time
he complained of feeling dizzy and sitting on the edge of the bed
told his uncle that he was not feeling well and then slumped onto
the floor. He does not believe that he hurt himself , i.e. , did not
hurt his head , although he did complain of some right foot pain.
He was still conscious as his uncle lifted him back to bed and then
an ambulance was called.
After a few minutes , the patient lost consciousness , rolling his
eyes back with some facial twitching bilaterally and tongue
retraction. This episode lasted about five minutes. There was no
tongue biting , no urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence. The
patient gained full recovery of his alertness upon waking up but
was a bit diaphoretic. His aunt checked his vital signs which were
blood pressure 70/40 , pulse 79. The patient had also complained of
chest pain for a few minutes prior to his episode. When the EMTs
arrived , the patient was alert and oriented times three , cold and
clammy , temperature 98.6 , pulse 89 , respirations 26 , blood pressure
82/60.
The patient was brought to the emergency room and was orthostatic
by blood pressure ( 10 points ) from lying to sitting. He was given
500 ccs of normal saline and was no longer orthostatic , comfortably
sitting up in the bed. At about 9:00 p.m. he complained of feeling
dizzy and became diaphoretic while trying to stand up. The patient
was again brought into bed. He became unresponsive for one minute
with his eyes rolled up and some bilateral face twitching. This
episode only lasted about one minute. The patient was admitted for
observation.
Past medical history reveals the following: 1 ) Mild mental
retardation since about 10 years ago. 2 ) Movement disorder ( tics )
on Stelazine. 3 ) End stage renal disease thought to be secondary
to hypertension. 4 ) Status post parathyroidectomy for secondary
hyperparathyroidism. 5 ) Partial thyroidectomy for goiter
incidentally found at surgery. 6 ) Status post partial gastrectomy
for peptic ulcer disease in the 1960&apos;s. 7 ) History of MRSA from
wound in 1988. 8 ) Hepatitis B surface antibody positive and
hepatitis C virus positive. Medications on admission: Calcium
carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid; nephrocaps , 1 PO qd; DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd;
Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. There are no known allergies. Social
history: The patient was a former smoker and has a history of
alcohol abuse but no IV drug use. He lives with his aunt and uncle
and is mildly retarded.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs
showed a lying blood pressure of 96/60 ,
pulse 80 , sitting up blood pressure 104/70 , pulse 96 , temperature
97.5 , O2 sat 95% on room air. The patient was a well nourished ,
black male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam was unremarkable.
Neck showed JVD of 4 cms. No lymphadenopathy. Chest was clear to
auscultation. Heart revealed S1 , S2 , normal rate and rhythm with a
1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.
No CVA tenderness. Abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses. Bowel
sounds were positive. The patient was guaiac negative with brown
stool. Extremities revealed a tender , edematous dorsal aspect of
right foot , with full range of motion at the ankle joint. Left
extremity benign. Neuro exam was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 142 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 94 , bicarb 32 , BUN 38 , creatinine 8.6 ,
glucose 168. A CBC revealed white count of 8.82 , hematocrit 35 ,
platelets 246. Calcium was 9.7. Chest x-ray revealed mild
pulmonary vascular redistribution with no significant CHF and no
infiltrates. Ankle x-rays on the right revealed no fracture or
dislocation. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 ,
axis 2 degrees , some 1 mm ST elevations in I and AVL , T-waves flat
in lead III. The slight elevations in ST were consistent with EKG
on 1/9/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was observed overnight and put on
an oral renal diet , checking orthostatics
frequently. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout his
hospital course and remained hemodynamically stable with no
orthostasis. The patient was evaluated by the renal service who
assessed that this episode was most likely secondary to the
extensive fluid removal from dialysis leading to a low blood
pressure. In addition , they noted that seizures and orthostasis
are often seen status post dialysis in some patients. They
recommended no further work up of this seizure episode and
recommended no prophylaxis with an antiepileptic. The patient
underwent dialysis again on 6/5/94 per schedule. After this
dialysis , the patient was asymptomatic , not orthostatic and did not
complain of any light headedness.
As the patient complained of right foot pain , right foot films were
obtained which revealed nondisplaced fractures of the second ,
third , fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Orthopaedic service was
consulted who put the patient in a bivalve cast with a toe plate.
Physical therapy was consulted. The patient was allowed to sit in
a chair and engage in nonweight bearing activities. His foot was
elevated on three pillows for 72 hours. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and now awaits placement into a skilled
nursing facility for rehabilitation , given his casted right lower
leg.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged on his medications
from admission which include: 1 ) Nephrocaps , 1 PO
qd. 2 ) Calcium carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid. 3 ) DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd.
4 ) Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. The patient will be seen again in
orthopaedics clinic on Friday , 5/13/94 at 9:15 a.m. The patient is
discharged in stable condition to a rehab/skilled nursing facility
per wishes of patient , family and per recommendation of physical
therapy.

STATUS: resumed on home pain regimen , required additional 25 mg oxycodone
overnight.
--------- STUDIES:
I- CT showed: kidney stones on R , by CT ureter in ED , no hydro.
stones are old , not clear that this is causing her current pain.
-------- IMP: 59F with CAD and recent PCI now with
nephrolithiasis and pain control problems. PLAN:
1. CV: gave lasix to increase filtration and UOP , while
increasing IVF to keep up w/ euvolemic state.
- cont outpt regimen - asa , statin , bb , acei. 2. GU/RENAL: increase
UOP w/ IVF and Lasix. 3. ID: does not appear to have systemic
infection. Inflammation of ureter. tx UTI ( UA+ ) with cipro 250 mg PO x 7
days. Started 4/23 , ending 3/6
4. FEN: Diabetic , low salt , low fat/cholesterol diet 5. Pain control with
home regimen of MScontin and
oxycodone. Switched to 45 mg oxycontin PO q12h instead of MS contin upon
discharge as patient requiring frequent PRN for breakthrough. Of note ,
back pain crosses lumbosacrum , radiates down legs bilaterally , and to
groin bilaterally. This distribution is consistent with a
more mucskuloskeletal etiology of pain , rather than R-sided
nephrolithiasis.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must continue your medications , especially aspirin and plavix to
protect your stent. Continue the Ciprrfloxacin for your UTI. Follow up
with your doctors or call to reschedule the appointments. Call your
doctor or return to the ER if you have fever , chills , sweats , worsening
shortness of breath , chest pain , or any other problems.

Discharge Date: 2/13/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEGIONELLA PNEUMONIA , BILATERAL PLEURAL
EFFUSIONS.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old
female with a distant history of
ovarian cancer , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus
erythematosus features , and history of TTP , status post
splenectomy , who was admitted with fever , shortness of breath and
pleuritic chest pain. She was in her usual state of health until
October of this year , when she began to experience dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath one week after her husband died.
Initially she thought it was anxiety secondary to her husband&apos;s
death , but this shortness of breath began to increase and occurred
on rest. She also reports that she has had a recent history of
orthopnea and says that for the past few months she has had
bilateral lower extremity edema with gradual onset. She also has
had a dry , non productive cough for the past month and three days
ago began to have fevers up to 102 , chills , nausea , dry heaves ,
headache and diarrhea. The shortness of breath has increased in
intensity and yesterday she began to experience sharp pleuritic
right chest pain. She denied productive cough , neck stiffness ,
photophobia , sick contacts , chest pain , palpitations , or recent
travel. Of note , the patient had been on Plaquenil previously but
she self discontinued this three months ago because she has been
feeling well. She has had no recurrence of her rheumatoid
arthritis symptoms , which for her include arthritis in her hands.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for
diabetes type 2 , hypertension , TTP , history
of splenectomy , history of Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal
sepsis , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosus
features , history of osteomyelitis in the right ankle , history of
ovarian cancer in 1989 , status post chemotherapy , total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications include diltiazem 240 mg a day ,
lisinopril 40 mg a day , Naprosyn 500 mg b.i.d. , NPH
insulin 24 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Entex-LA.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her son. Her husband recently
died in October of this year with esophageal
cancer. She has no alcohol or tobacco use. She is an elementary
school teacher.
FAMILY HISTORY: Family history is significant for coronary artery
disease as well as breast carcinoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 98 , pulse in
the 100s , blood pressure 182/99. The patient&apos;s oxygen saturation
was 92% on 5 liters. She was alert and oriented , in mild
respiratory distress. The skin was without rash. HEENT: Not
significant. NECK: The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic , regular rhythm , without
murmurs , gallops or rubs. She had no jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: The lungs revealed markedly decreased breath sounds at the
bases and faint crackles at the bases on the right. ABDOMEN:
Abdominal examination was completely benign. No hepatomegaly or
masses. She did have a scar from the splenectomy. EXTREMITIES:
The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There were no cords.
Negative Homans&apos; sign. There was no clubbing or cyanosis.
NEUROLOGICAL: The neurological examination was intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant laboratory studies included a
sodium of 137 , white blood cell count of 19.5
with 2 bands and 86 polys as well as Howell-Jolly bodies.
Hematocrit was 38.6 , platelets 495 , 000. CK was 50 , troponin was 0.
D-dimer was greater than 1 , 000. Chest x-ray revealed large
bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right. She had a CT
scan which was a limited study that showed no evidence of a
pulmonary embolism. It showed a questionable infiltrate in the
right lung versus compressive atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 57-year-old female with a
distant history of ovarian cancer and TTP , who
was admitted with likely community acquired pneumonia and bilateral
moderate to large pleural effusions. Initially the patient was
given cefuroxime and levofloxacin in the emergency department for a
presumed community acquired pneumonia. She also was given Lasix
for diuresis , given there was a question of whether or not she was
having any heart failure. Given her elevated D-dimer , she had a
spiral CT scan of the chest which did not reveal any evidence of
pulmonary embolus and also had lower extremity Dopplers which were
negative. However , there was a continuous Doppler wave form on the
study which raised the suspicion of a more proximal venous
compression. Therefore , she underwent abdominal CT scan , which did
not show any evidence of venous obstruction as well as lymphatic
obstruction.
1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient was admitted and treated for
what was thought to initially be just a community acquired
pneumonia with large effusions , likely peripneumonic in nature.
She initially was started on cefuroxime and azithromycin by the
General Medicine team. She was pancultured as well as had
Legionella urine antigen sent. Subsequently her Legionella urine
antigen became positive and repeat test again revealed that this
was in fact positive. At that time , levofloxacin was added given
recommendations from the Infectious Disease Service. She was
continued on azithromycin; however , cefuroxime was discontinued as
there was no evidence of other etiology of her pneumonia. She
underwent thoracentesis late the evening of her admission , which
revealed a transudate. Cytology was sent on this and was negative
as well as all cultures were negative from this. She underwent
multiple bilateral therapeutic pleuracentesis , given that the
effusions were quite large. Ultrasound revealed multiple
loculations on the right side and she had to undergo right sided
ultrasound guided thoracentesis to remove fluid. In addition , the
patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix to help with the
effusions.
The patient continued to have a high oxygen requirement throughout
the hospitalization despite aggressive thoracentesis. However , as
she was diuresed aggressively , her oxygen requirement was down from
initially 5 to 6 liters per nasal cannula. Prior to discharge , she
was off of O2 except that she had desaturations to 86% with
ambulation. Therefore , she was discharged home with p.r.n. oxygen.
She remained afebrile throughout the rest of the hospitalization
and her pulmonary status continued to improve prior to discharge.
Other complications during the hospitalization included an elevated
platelet count up to 800. This was thought likely to be acute
phase reactant secondary to infection and fever and this will be
followed as an outpatient. In addition to this , she had an
elevated CA-125 level. This was discussed with her GYN oncologist
and he felt that this was likely from the effusions , but again
should be followed as an outpatient to make sure that this resolves
as the effusions continue to resolve. Abdominal CT scan , which was
done to rule out more proximal venous compression did not reveal
any recurrence of ovarian cancer.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 2000 , with services
as well as p.r.n. oxygen. She was in stable condition. She had no
problems with her diabetes , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis
throughout the rest of her hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications include Lasix
80 mg b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale ,
lisinopril 40 mg a day , levofloxacin 500 mg times 14 days ,
Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with Dr. Michalek in one week and
she is to have her platelets checked as well as a
CA-125 as her Legionella pneumonia resolves.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Andreessen is a 31 year-old black female
with diabetes mellitus ( insulin
requiring ) who is admitted with emesis and diabetic ketoacidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in
1984 after the patient presented with a
history of polyuria , polydipsia , fatigue. She was treated with
oral hypoglycemics initially. In 1985 she was hospitalized for a
questionable episode of diabetic ketoacidosis with recurrent
polydipsia , polyuria , nausea and vomiting and she was changed to
insulin treatment.
Subsequently , the patient had intermittent compliance , with
occasional dietary indiscretions with greater than 2500 calories
intake and decreased exercise. Her dose of insulin in 1991 was
Humulin N 40 units subcutaneous qam and 20 units qpm with regular
insulin 5 units qam and 5 units qpm added. In April of 1993 her
glycosylated hemoglobin ( hemoglobin A1C ) was 20.2 and her finger
stick blood glucose was 265. On August , 1993 her finger stick
blood glucose ranged from 96 to 189. In October 1994 her insulin
dosing was 40 units subcutaneous qam and regular 5 units qam , 5
units of regular q noon and 5 units qpm.
In early October of 1994 her finger stick blood glucoses ranged
between 160 and 240. She indicated she was depressed about her
diabetes. On January she awoke at 5 am and had 10 episodes of
emesis progressing from clear to greenish to black. She noted that
she had felt well the day previous with no dietary indiscretions
and had taken her insulin as usual on the days prior to this
episode. She denied any abdominal pain , there was no history of
fever or chills and no diarrhea. There was also no immediate
complaint of hematemesis. The patient went to Ertmu Oaktan Wallro Medical Center Urgent Care unable to hold down her food intake and
blood sugar was noted to be 333. She received 5 units of
subcutaneous insulin and her blood sugar went to 247. She also
received intravenous fluids , 25 mg of Compazine and 0.5 mg of
intravenous Ativan. The patient had serum ketones present and her
serum bicarb was 16 , initially noted at Uflehill Brent Hospital Medical Center She was transferred to Unral Imbrohealt Health
Emergency Department for further management. The patient&apos;s recent
creatinine clearance in the urine was 70 , her urine total protein
was 177 mg for 24 hours. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable
for adult onset diabetes mellitus requiring insulin , endometriosis ,
status post exploratory laparotomy in 1990. She was never
pregnant , para 0 , gravida 0. She had a history of dysmenorrhea.
She had a history of yeast vaginitis , history of
hypercholesterolemia and a history of atrial septal defect ,
repaired in 1975. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of
admission , the patient was on insulin Lente 40 units subcutaneous
qam , regular 5 units subcutaneous qam and 5 units subcutaneous q
noon , 5 units subcutaneous qpm; demulon and lupron for 9 months
which was discontinued several days prior to admission. ALLERGIES:
To Penicillin and sulfa drugs , the results of which were not clear.
Also , aspirin caused epistaxis in the past. FAMILY AND SOCIAL
HISTORY: She lives by herself. She works as a lawyer and professor
of law. She noted that her family history is positive for adult
onset diabetes mellitus in her mother and her grandmother as well
as a family history of hypertension. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealed
metromenorrhagia and increased menstrual flow recently. She also
noted she had decreased her exercise recently.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination her vital signs were
as follows: Temperature 99.7 , heart rate of
127 , blood pressure and respiratory rate normal. She was a
pleasant , young , black female frequently vomiting. HEENT: Notable
for normal examination. Neck supple. There was brisk carotid
upstrokes , no thyromegaly was noted. Lungs were clear to
auscultation and percussion. Heart was tachycardic. S1 and S2
with a holosystolic murmur heard at the apex radiating to the left
sternal border. There was an early decrescendo diastolic murmur at
the base in the aortic area , the lateral resolved with fluids.
Abdomen was tender in the epigastrium , it was very tender in the
suprapubic area. Extremities were without edema , cord cyanosis or
erythema. Neurological examination was within normal limits on
modalities.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 14 , BUN of 12 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 290. White blood cell count 10.6 , platelets 255 ,
hematocrit 36.1 with a mean corpuscular volume 85.5. Coags were
normal. Arterial blood gas pH 7.24 , pO2 102 , pCO2 of 27 ,
bicarbonate 12. She was acid test positive. Her chest x-ray
showed questionably large pulmonary arteries bilaterally. There
was no infiltrate or effusion noted. KUB noted a large bladder.
There was no bowel gas , we could not rule out ascites. EKG was
notable for sinus tachycardia at 122 , intervals were 0.15 , 0.088
and 0.47.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Buffey was admitted with a diagnosis of
diabetic ketoacidosis. She was started on
intravenous fluids of D5 normal saline with 40 mEq of potassium per
liter. She also received and insulin drip intravenously. She had
her finger stick blood glucoses checked every 2 hours. She also
had her blood electrolytes and acid tests checked frequently.
Given the fact that she was febrile and had presented with
acidosis , had a harsh cardiac murmur , she had blood cultures times
3 drawn. There were no obvious sources of infection.
Regarding her GI bleed , she began to cough up coffee ground emesis
after repeated episodes of wretching throughout the day. The
bleeding was thought to be due to a Mallory-Weiss tear due to the
excessive vomiting. The patient had an NG tube placed for lavage
which quickly lavaged clear after approximately 1 liter of diluant.
A nasal gastric tube was put to Gomco low suction. Additionally ,
the patient had intravenous fluids running and her orthostatics and
hematocrit were checked frequently. She was started on H2 blockers
intravenously and a GI consultation was obtained.
Regarding the diabetic ketoacidosis , the patient obtained
consultation from the Endocrine Division. With intravenous fluids
and insulin drip her ketoacidosis resolved. The endocrinologist
suggested the ultimate regimen of insulin which will be described
below. Notably , the patient indicated that she could not reliably
time the midday lunch schedule. Therefore , the patient was given
some flexibility in terms of dosing of insulin at that hour.
Regarding her cardiac workup , the patient was noted to have a loud
systolic murmur. She was evaluated by the Dell Hospital
who recommended echocardiography. The results of the
echocardiogram were as described below. The echocardiogram was
obtained on 2 of July , the results were as follows: The left atrium
was mildly dilated. The tricuspid valve leaflet excursion was
mildly increased with tricuspid regurgitation measured as 2+ out of
4+ with a peak velocity of 2.5. It was thought that she had a
mildly dilated right atrium and a mildly concentric hypertrophied
left ventricle. Mitral regurgitation was 3+ out of 4+. Left
ventricular wall thickness was upper limits of normal with
preserved left ventricular systolic function ejection fraction of
65 percent. The patient abnormalities of her atrial ventricular
canal noted consistent with ostium primum. Her left and right
atrial ventricular grooves inserted at the same level of the
intraventricular septum. There was some evidence of flow reversal
in the pulmonary veins as well as the mitral regurgitation noted
above. There was a high flow velocity jet seen in the paramembrane
of intraventricular septum , moving from left to right , consistent
with residual ventricular septal defect. There was no atrial
septal defect seen status post surgical repair. There was a small
echocardiogram bright density at the left ventricular site of the
paramembranous septum thought to be an anomalous cord attachment
from the mitral valve versus endocarditis.
On January , the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram
to evaluate this abnormality seen above. There was no evidence of
residual atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect. There
was an anomalous chordal attachment to the base of the interior
leaflet of the mitral valve and no endocarditis vegetations were
seen.
The patient was noted to have hypertension and was started on
Lisinopril , nifedipine was transiently given but was discontinued.
The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition on October ,
1994. There were no complications of the hospitalization.
Operations and procedures of the hospitalization were an esophageal
gastroduodenoscopy by Dr. Cornea on July , 1994.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Lisinopril 20 mg po q day; insulin
12 units plus a regular scale qam before breakfast , insulin 8 units
plus the scale of regular insulin q noon before lunch , insulin 8
units of regular plus a scale of regular qpm before supper , insulin
NPH 15 units subcutaneous qhs. The scale of regular insulin was as

Discharge Date: 1/20/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
PROBLEMS DURING ADMISSION: 1 ) MIGRAINE HEADACHE.
2 ) NONSPECIFIC ABDOMINAL PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35 year old female
who carries a diagnosis of lupus for
seven years , recently discharged with a pulmonary embolism and deep
vein thrombosis , on Coumadin and Lovenox , now returns with a
complaint of new onset chest pain and sob. Previously the patient has been
stable with her SLE but had started Plaquenil recently. On
9/28/99 she presented to her rheumatologist complaining of
intermittent leg swelling for the past year and was found to have
left superficial femoral and gastrocnemius DVT. She was about to
begin Lovenox when she mentioned that she had also experienced
occasional pleuritic chest pain over the last five years. She then had a V/Q
scan which was read as intermediate probability for PE. For definitive
diagnosis , a pulmonary angiogram was done on 2/28/99 showing bilateral apical
small pulmonary emboli.She was treated with IV heparin and was started on
Coumadin to a therapeutic INR of 2.0. She also had an unremarkable
echocardiogram at that time. On 2/30/99 , the patient returned
with increasing wheezing and shortness of breath. Her INR was 1.8.
Work up revealed an intermediate probability right-sided V/Q
mismatch with a probable new PE. Repeat echocardiogram showed no right
heart strain. It was thought that she had had a recurrent PE in
the setting of subtherapeutic INR. LE DVT was stable on the LENIs.
She was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin to obtain a goal INR of
3.0. Unfortunately , two days prior to admission , the patient again
noted increased dyspnea on exertion. She has otherwise been
active , feeling well over the past week. She denies chest pain ,
leg pain , wheezing. V/Q scan performed on the morning of admission
showed new mismatched lesions at the left posterior base and right
anterior base. She notes stomach upset for the previous four days ,
recently had an upper GI work up , including an EGD which was
negative by patient&apos;s report. She denies any melena , nausea ,
vomiting , BRPPR. She has been tolerating p.o.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) SLE x 7 years , on Plaquenil recently.
2 ) Migraine headaches. 3 ) History of DVT.
4 ) Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 5 ) Status post
cesarean section.
ALLERGIES: Bactrim causing diarrhea , Ceftin causing diarrhea.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Tylenol p.r.n.; Plaquenil 200 mg q. d.;
Coumadin 7 mg p.o. q. d.; Lovenox for
the previous 6 days; Allegra; Albuterol MDI; Cipro; Heptadine.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of clotting or bleeding disorders.
Her father died of leukemia. She has two sisters
with arthritis and one sister with ulcerative colitis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been married for 10 years and has
an eight-year-old daughter. She is an office
worker in Ver Albpids , Pennsylvania 98749 and has not worked for the past month. She
quit smoking on 9/28/99 at the time of her first admission. She
has 10-15 pack years and denies any history of alcohol or IVDU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: An obese , pleasant , female in no acute
distress. Pulse 87. Blood pressure 118/50.
Saturation 97 percent on room air. Afebrile. HEENT: Oropharynx
is clear. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly or
JVD. Lungs are clear to auscultation except scattered rales at the
right base. Heart normal S1 and S2. A II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border. Abdomen - large , obese ,
nontender , nondistended. Extremities - no palpable cords or edema.
Neurologic - alert and oriented , no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 0.7 , WBC 105 , hematocrit 40 , platelets
307. Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at
86. Normal intervals and axis. No ST-T wave abnormalities.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was
placed on intravenous heparin and the Lovenox and Coumadin were
discontinued in anticipation for an IVC filter placement the
following morning. She also received intravenous dihydroergotamine
for migraine headaches with good effect by the following morning.
The following morning , the patient received 2 units of FFP because
her INR was 3.0. The decision to place a filter was postponed and
instead a pulmonary angiogram was performed. This revealed no
obvious recurrent pulmonary embolism. The morning
of 10/27/99 , prior to the angiogram , two
events occurred. First event , the patient was walking to the
bathroom and her heart rate was noted to go at 140 beats per minute
and was approximately sinus tachycardia or supraventricular
tachycardia. This resolved after 45 seconds without intervention
and did not recur and there were no associated symptoms and the
patient was unaware of the event. The second event occurred about
one hour later and the patient noted approximately 5/10 sharp right
lower sternal border chest pain which was not pleuritic and not
positional and resolved spontaneously over the next 5 minutes and
did not recur. She also had some abdominal pain. She tolerated p.o.&apos;s without
any gastrointestinal
symptoms throughout and the pain was mild with a benign abdominal
exam. This will be pursued by her outpatient physician , if
indicated. The patient was resumed on Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.
as well as Lovenox in the interim 100 mg subcu b.i.d. until she
achieves a therapeutic INR which was determined by Cardiology to be , 3.5 ,
given that she has not
had a recurrent PE. Throughout her stay she remained afebrile and
with a saturation of approximately 94-95 percent on room air ,
breathing comfortably.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow up with her primary care doctor and have
her INR checked in two days.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Cipro heptadine 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. q. d.; Coumadin 10 mg
p.o. q. h.s.; Lovenox 100 mg subcu q. 12h..
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged home. She will follow up
with her primary care doctor within one week.

Discharge Date: 6/20/1995
HISTORY: Ms. Pizzo is a 63-year-old woman with peripheral vascular
disease who recently underwent revision of her left
superior femoral artery anterior tibial bypass graft , who now
presents with a cool , ischemic left foot.
Mrs. Denman is a 63-year-old , insulin-dependent diabetic with a long
history of peripheral vascular disease as well as multiple surgical
procedures. She underwent a right transmetatarsal amputation in
1990 and subsequently underwent a right femorla distal saphenous
vein bypass graft in 1991 which was later revised in 1992. She
seems to be doing well with the left side until September of this year ,
at which time she underwent a left superficial femoral artery to
anterior tibial artery bypass using non-reversed basilic vein
harvested from the right arm. She , however , had a large great toe
ulcer , possibly attributed to hammertoe , which subsequently
underwent a left great toe amputation performed on the 16 of November . After this time , she was discharged to the Nut Hospital in
Amore Pu , where she was making progress in physical therapy and
rehabilitation. On the day prior to admission , she was exercising
with 4 pound weights on her legs with the physical therapist when
she described a cool sensation in her foot. She reported that her
foot had been blue , and there were no Dopplerable pulses. Color
later returned. The absence of pulses persisted over the course of
the night , after which point she was referred back to Largrine Medical Center for evaluation. She denies any significant pain
or any other complications.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for history of insulin-dependent
diabetes , history of coronary artery
disease , history of hypertension , cataracts , MRSA from her toe
wound on the 3 of March .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above , as well as
debridements of her toe amputation wound
site.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , insulin Lente 12
units subcu q p.m. supplemented by sliding
scale regular insulin scale , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg q
d , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg b.i.d. , Ofloxacin 200 mg
p.o. q 12 , Ecotrin 225 mg q d , Vancomycin 1250 mg q 24. She
reports an allergy to codeine and iodine.
ADMISSION EXAMINATION: Remarkable for the following findings:
She was afebrile , heart rate 72 , blood
pressure 140/70. Her right lower extremity was characterized by a
well-healed transmetatarsal amputation site. The foot was warm and
pink. The left side , however , was cool in comparison , although
remained pink with adequate capillary refill. Both femoral pulses
were easily palpable , as well as dorsal pedal pulse on the right.
Her right posterior tibial pulse was additionally biphasic by
Doppler. On the left , she had a biphasic Doppler graft pulse and
dorsopedal , although she had no identifiable posterior tibial
pulse. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.
Admission labs were likewise unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Bulger was admitted and placed on intravenous
Heparin until the following morning , at which
time she proceeded to the Angiography Suite. She was found to have
two 95% stenosis in a long segment of the left SFA and the left
distal SFA and anterior tibial vein graft was completely
thrombosed. She was successfully treated with stent placement and
received heparin and urokinase in the Intensive Care Unit overnight
with a turn-over pulses of the left leg Doppler. The following
day , her stents were removed. During the remainder of the hospital
course , her left foot remained pink and warm. Her wound had an
infection of exposed bone , but otherwise appeared to be granulating
well. Although left transmetatarsal amputation being considered ,
it was felt that she had a good chance of healing the wound
appropriately. She had a single temperature spike , although all
cultures remained negative. She had continuation of her Heparin
while she was started on a course of Coumadin to reserve patency of
her graft. The remainder of the hospital course was unremarkable.
On the 25 of May , she was discharged back to the Rose-walt Hospital in Coln
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin 1250 mg IV q d , Ofloxacin 200
mg p.o. b.i.d. ( both antibiotics to
continue for an additional two week course ) , Coumadin with target
INR of 2.0 , last target 1.6 , then received 10 mg in evening x 2.
Additionally , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q 4 prn , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , insulin NPH 10 units subcu b.i.d. , sliding scale insulin
subcu q 4 , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg q d , Lopressor 50 mg
b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. She will follow with Dr. Noah in
one to two weeks.

Discharge Date: 10/10/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Tools is a 79-year-old man with
a known history of three-vessel
disease , who is status post an intraaortic balloon placement. He
has a history of hypertension , noninsulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , and is a former smoker. The patient presents with a two
to three month history of exertional angina while climbing a hill
or rushing on a flat surface. He also admits to symptoms of
shortness of breath , light headedness , and diaphoresis. He denies
any nausea , vomiting , or palpitations. He was seen by Dr. Jean Buchinsky who did an exercise tolerance test. The patient exercised
for 3 minutes and 40 seconds on a modified Bruce protocol with a
heart rate of 99 , which is 70% predicted , a blood pressure of 190
over palp and the test was stopped secondary to typical substernal
chest pressure. An electrocardiogram revealed a 1 millimeters ST
depression in V3 through V5 , and 2:1 second degree AV block. The
patient had catheterization , which revealed a left main
arteriostenosis of 70% , a circumflex coronary artery with an 80-90%
proximal stenosis , a left anterior descending proximal stenosis of
70% , and mid 70% right coronary artery occlusion midway. He had
right iliac tortuous stenosis. He also had intraaortic balloon
pump placed and went straight to the operating room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , irritable bowel
syndrome secondary to a colectomy for colitis , splenomegaly.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for an appendectomy and
cholecystectomy , and as mentioned above ,
colectomy.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the operating room on
July , 1998 , where he went a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal artery , and a saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery. The patient did well , came off bypass without
incident , with his right intraaortic balloon pump in place and
was brought up to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. The
patient was extubated on postoperative day 1. The intraaortic
balloon pump was weaned on postoperative day 2 and Mr. Shopbell
went into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 2 with a
controlled rate. He was treated with intravenous Lopressor and
converted back to sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial
contractions. The patient continued in atrial fibrillation , atrial
flutter , with a rate in the 90s to 110s , and was unable to be
converted. Pressures remained in the 130/80 range. Mr. Coffee
also had some urinary retention , which required him to have a leg
bag Foley catheter after failing bleeding trials. He will follow
up with Urology in about a week , Dr. Milford Jackson , in the urology
clinic.

**CONSULTS: ACE , SS , nutrition
**Hospital Course:
CV/I: Patient was sucessfully ruled out by serial enzymes for a
potential myocardial infarction. The patient was continuedon his home ASA ,
statin , and BB during his hospital course. To rule out concern for ischemia
as a role in the deterioration of his cardiomyopathy , a left heart
catheterization was performed which showed worsening CAD from his prior
study 5 years. The patient has 3vd disease with diffuse lesions in his RT
PDA , RT LV-VR , LAD , Lcx. Given the patient&apos;s symptoms and echocardiographic
evidence of cardiomyopathy proceeded the progression of his CAD , it is
likely that his arteriosclerosis was not the primary etiology of his
imparied cardiac performance though may be contributing to his disease at
this time.
CV/P: CXR on admission revealed pulmonary edema. The patient had
an excellent reponse to diuresis on lasix and was weaned to room air on
the day after admission. His home blood pressure medications were
continued , and were well controlled. A right heart catheterization was
performed on 6/3 which showed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures , particularly with a Pcw of 24 and mean RA pressure of 5. The
patient was started on Imdur during this admission. His lisinopril was
continued.
Pt CV/R: Patient is undergoing evaulation for ICD. NO ectopy was noted
during full-time telemetric monitoring.
PULM: His OSA was treated with CPAP at 6 cm. No active asthma rx. No
wheezes on exam.
ENDO: Patient was maintained off his oral medications and placed on
insulin alone. On admission , his blood sugars were in the 300s. His Last
A1C was found to be 9.5. While following his blood sugars , his insulin was
titrated up and drug therapy discontinued. He was discharged with BID NPH
insulin to replace his previous med/insulin regimen. WSRH outpatient
diabetes services follow-up will be arranged for the patient.
HEME: On coumadin with admit INR 1.1. Coumadin was held
during admission and patient instructed to discontinue medication as
outpatient considering no hx of afib , LV throbus , or DVT/clot as well as
questions with medication compliance.
F/E/N: Patient was instructed on proper diabetic and HF diet.
PSYCH/SOCIAL: Hx EtOH abuse , last drink day of admit. LFTs were

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. New stroke , right sided weakness and confusion.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
2. Myasthenia gravis.
3. Osteoarthritis.
4. Pernicious anemia.
5. Hypertension , degenerative joint disease.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right sided weakness and confusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Benny is an 83 year old woman
with a history of myasthenia gravis ,
arthritis , pernicious anemia and hypertension and degenerative
joint disease with nerve impinging resulting in decreased reflexes
in the left lower extremity. She was in her usual state of health
until when she woke to go to the bathroom at approximately 2 a.m.
on the day of admission. She had difficulty getting up from the
sofa where she sleeps and slipped and fell to her knees. Because
she stated , &quot;her right leg was weak&quot;. She started speaking and
talking loudly. Her son heard her , came up to help her. At the
time he arrived , she was crawling around on her hands and knees and
appeared to be mildly confused. He helped her up and assisted her
to the bathroom. She was able to walk with assistance and returned
to bed and did not feel like she needed to call a physician at that
time. She then awoke at approximately six in the morning and was
able to walk without assistance to wash her face and then to eat
breakfast. However , at breakfast , the son noted that she was using
her right hand clumsily cutting pieces of banana onto the floor ,
not adequately reaching her mouth to feed herself and had begun to
use her knife to eat her cereal. He discussed the problem with
her. She agreed that she probably needed to call a doctor about
this. She attempted to get out of the chair and again slipped
forward because of right leg weakness. She contacted her physician
who recommended that she be seen at the Troitcape Medical Center
When seen there , when leaving , her son noted that she seemed to run
into things on her right side. With entering the car , did not pick
up her right leg well. At the scboth community hospital , she was found to
have significant right hand weakness and proximal right leg
weakness. She was sent to the Ist Oska Rutl Memorial Health for further evaluation.
She denies having had any previous neurologic events similar to
this episode. She has had an episode of dizziness , nausea and
vomiting associated with a severe right occipital headache back in
8/5 at which time she was evaluated at the Hosch Reathertage Supro Grahot Clinic and was given
diagnosis of benign positional vertigo which since resolved. At
that time , she had a CT scan which showed only periventricular
white matter disease as well as an increased soft tissue density in
the region of the sella. An LP at that time revealed no white
cells and red cells which cleared with successive tubes. She also
six months ago was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. At that time ,
she had the following symptoms: She had difficulty keeping her
neck up , difficulty swallowing , her eyelids were drooping. These
symptoms resolved quickly with Tensalon injection. She has been
since started on Mestinon and Prednisone with good relief and is
followed by Dr. Kaushiva at Ci Hospital for this problem
and was initially diagnosed by Dr. Gerbatz at Lametizens Health Services .
With regards to her current episode , she denies having any
symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting and
palpitations. She has not had any febrile illness , nausea or
vomiting recently. She has not had any episodes of a shade coming
down before her eyes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Myasthenia gravis diagnosed by
Dr. Wilson Pozos at Hermum Medical Center
approximately six months ago. Symptoms as described above , good
relief with Mestinon and Prednisone. 2. Pernicious anemia ,
intrinsic factor antibody positive , receives monthly B12
injections. 3. Spine degenerative joint disease , LS spine CT in
1/11 showed most marked deterioration at the L4-L5 vertebra with
spondylolisthesis , bilateral foraminal narrowing and moderate
spinal stenosis. She has long standing decreased reflexes in her
left leg and some decreased sensation to light touch in her left
foot. 4. Hypertension , has taken Reserpine intermittently over the
last 25 years. She has tolerated this well apparently. This is an
outmoded medication however because she has been on it so long , it
has not been discontinued. However , she has been noted to suffer
from some mild depression. 5. Osteoarthritis affecting mostly the
hands and feet followed by Dr. Hiram Rodrigus at Toncamp Hospital 6. Long standing difficulty sleeping , takes
Phenobarbital 15 mg at night prn for this problem for the last 30
years 7. Frequent UTI&apos;s. 8. Episode of benign positional vertigo ,
8/5 as described above. 9. Status post hysterectomy , status post
ovariectomy. 10. Some difficulty with rightward gaze and upward
gaze of the right eye noted as long back as 4/7 11. Hemorrhoids.

rely and tune , possibly mild decreased attention. Memory: Fair
for events leading to hospitalization but some difficulty getting
logical sequence of occurrences , may partly be due to language
difficulties. Visual spacial: Clock shows poor organization ,
writes numbers down the middle of the circle. Cranial nerves II:
Right pupil is slightly larger than left pupil , reactive , visual
fields full to confrontation , 3 , 4 , 6 , possible decreased abduction
and vertical upgaze of the right eye. However , she denies double
vision. VII: Smiles symmetrically. Eyebrows symmetric. There is
possibly decreased left nasolabial fold on the left , however , smile
is symmetric. VIII: Hearing intact , finger rubbing bilaterally.
IX , X: Palate is up bilaterally. Turgor of the mouth is 5/5.
Tongue midline. Motor: No drifts , difficulty with fine finger
movement on the right side which is slightly slower than on the
left , has especially more difficulty on the right side initiating
the movements figuring out what to do. Right rapid alternating
movements of the right hand is slightly slower than the left.
Power: Deltoid , biceps and triceps 5/5 , bilaterally symmetric ,
however does not raise her right deltoid as high. Wrist extensors
on the right are 4+/5 and on the left 5/5. Interossei on the right
5-/5 , on the left 5/5. Lower extremities: Iliopsoas , quads , hams
and gastrocs all 5/5 symmetric. EHL possibly slightly diminished
strength on the right. Has increased difficulty with heel to shin
on the right leg probably suggestive of proximal right lower
extremity weakness not apparent on cognition testing. Sensories
and light touch and pinprick are grossly intact throughout. No
double simultaneously stimulation extension , proprioception intact
in the feet bilaterally. Decreased vibration in the left foot
compared to the right foot , reflexes upper extremities 2+
symmetric , lower extremities - right lower extremity 3+ knee , 2+
ankle. Toes downgoing , left , 1+ knee , 1+ ankle , toe downgoing.
Coordination: Finger to nose within normal limits bilaterally.
Heel to shin slightly worse on the right lower extremity , possibly
secondary to proximal flexor weakness. Gait: Walks quickly but
requires holding onto assistants for balance. Incidentally , she
says it is because she needs shoes for arthritis , marked pronation
of the ankle on small steps.
LABS: Sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 106 , C02 25 , BUN 15
and creatinine 0.9 , glucose 125 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium
2.0 , B12 was normal. RPR nonreactive. PFT&apos;s normal. Phenobarb
level not detected. Tox screen positive for Benzodiazepine ( this
may have been due to sedation she received for the CT. However , it
is not clear that she received sedation ). Hematocrit 34.6 with MCV
of 80.6 , platelets 217 , white count 9.05 , polys 73 , 18 lymphs , 7
monos , 2 eo and 7 basophils. PT 13.1 , PTT 25.7. CT:
Periventricular white matter disease , slightly increased density
above the sella.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an elderly woman with hypertension ,
myasthenia gravis and arthritis who presented
with weakness of her right lower extremity and right hand and some
confusion as evidenced by using a knife to eat her cereal instead
of a spoon. Her exam was notable for mildly impaired attention ,
possibly confused clock difficulty with handwriting and decreased
strength of the right hand and likely probably decreased strength
to the right lower extremity. Hip flexors is based on the relative
difficulty with heel to shin on the right. Old findings on exam
included abnormalities of the right eye muscles , decreased left
palpebral fissure and sensory findings in the left lower
extremities as well as reflexes. Her presentation was consistent
with possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg more
than the face. This could have occurred in the pons area or the
internal capsule. The component of confusion however is less
explainable based on a deep lesion such as this and raised the
possibility of a small cortical insult. MRI showed no territorial
stroke , just T2 intense abnormalities in the periventricular white
matter , corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of small
vessel disease. Echo and Holter were not suggestive of
cardioembolic disease. Echo showed normal LV size , preserved LV
function with estimated ejection fraction of 80%. There is also
mild LVH , no thrombus was seen. There was aortic sclerosis with
mildly regurgitation , mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets
with mild mitral regurgitation and bubble study was negative.
Holter was sinus rhythm at 54 to 127 beats per minute. Occasional
frequent APB&apos;s , 14 atrial couplets , five runs of SVT ranging from 3
to 10 beats with heart rates 108 to 182 , occasionally only frequent
VPB&apos;s at all hours and one ventricular couplet. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions. Of
note on the MRI , the basilar artery appeared to be small caliber
and the carotid showed some calcification. On carotid noninvasive
studies , however , there was only minimal plaque in the carotid
arteries.
In summary , it appears that Ms. Epperly had a small vessel stroke.
She showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and was
able to walk without assistance on the second hospital day. She
also had improved right hand function and appeared to be less
confused. We recommended starting enteric coated aspirin which she
is to take one per day. In the setting of the acute stroke , we did
not control her blood pressure aggressively. Her pressures ranged
from systolics of 120 to 180 averaging around 140 to 150 with
diastolics usually in the 80&apos;s. We have suggested that she
discontinue the use of her Reserpine as intermittent use is
problematic especially with this medication and she admits to
intermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered from
some mild depression that can be associated with Reserpine. She
will be started on an alternative blood pressure as an out-patient
with Dr. Scotton in the next week. We did not wish to start this
medication in the acute setting. She will likely be started on an
Ace inhibitor for blood pressure control. We also suggested that
she discontinue the use of Phenobarbital for sleep as this might
contribute to confusion.
Finally , since she is on Prednisone and Mestinon , we asked the
patient whether she was taking GI prophylaxis. Evidently , she only
does this intermittently as well. She may be on Carefate , however ,
we suggested taking an H2 blocker once in the evening and have
provided her with the prescription for Zantac 150 mg q h.s. She
will follow-up with Dr. Milosch , her primary doctor at Ni Health as well as Dr. Salmen at the Ont Hospital
for her myasthenia gravis and stroke. She has an appointment with
Dr. Zurovec next week on Wednesday.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q day.
2. Prednisone 12.5 mg p.o. q.o.d.

Discharge Date: 6/11/1999
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FIBRILLATION STATUS POST
CARDIOVERSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 38-year-old African
American gentleman with a familial
dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately
20 percent , history of ventricular tachycardia status post AICD
placement , and recurrent atrial fibrillation status post two prior
attempts at cardioversion. The patient had also previously been
begun on amiodarone for chemical cardioversion , however , he
developed severe hyperthyroidism. The patient also has had several
recent admissions for exacerbations of his congestive heart
failure , most recently in February , 1998 when he was admitted for
tailored therapy. At that time , an echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of , approximately , 20 percent with atrial
dimension of 5 centimeters , left ventricular diastolic dimension of
7.7 centimeters , moderate-severe mitral regurgitation , and moderate
tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary artery pressure of
approximately 40 , plus right atrial pressure. The patient was , at
that time , diuresed to his dry weight , which is approximately 186
pounds. Unfortunately , he was again admitted in February of 1998
with volume overload and was diuresed. At that time , he was noted
to be in atrial fibrillation , and was cardioverted on his
previously implanted AICD.
His most recent admission was on May to March , when
he again was cardioverted by his AICD for atrial fibrillation and
treated for volume overload. In October of 1999 , he had increasing
firing of his AICD both for true ventricular tachycardia , as well
as for atrial fibrillation , and anti-tachycardia pacing. He was
seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on July , and was found to be in
atrial fibrillation and volume overloaded. His diuretics were
increased at that time , as his weight was 207 pounds , and he
diuresed down to a weight of 199 pounds. It was felt that
amiodarone would be the best drug for him in terms of management of
his ventricular and atrial arrhythmias , and so the patient
underwent an elective thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine. He
received 30 mCi of I-131. He now presents today after the thyroid
ablation for amiodarone load and cardioversion. The patient is
feeling relatively well , and is not experiencing any significant
dyspnea on exertion or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reports no
increased lower extremity edema. No neck pain. No fever or
chills. No nausea or vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Notable for dilated cardiomyopathy
diagnosed in 1992. His most recent V.02 is
19.5 in February of 1995. ( 2 ) AICD placement for ventricular
tachycardia in October of 1998. ( 3 ) Hyperthyroidism secondary to
amiodarone. ( 4 ) History of atrial fibrillation , status post
multiple cardioversions in the past ( see above ). ( 5 ) History of a
left renal infarct. ( 6 ) History of pancreatis.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to penicillin.
MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Captopril 75 milligrams q.i.d. ( 2 ) Digoxin 0.125
milligrams q.d. ( 3 ) Isordil 40 milligrams t.i.d.
( 4 ) Torsemide 200 milligrams b.i.d. ( 5 ) Coumadin 5 milligrams q.d.
( 6 ) Prilosec 20 milligrams b.i.d. ( 7 ) Zaroxolyn p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for no tobacco or alcohol use. No history
of intravenous drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a father who died of a myocardial
infarction at age 56 , a brother with
cardiomyopathy who died in the 50s , and another brother with
dilated cardiomyopathy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The physical examination was notable
for a jugular venous pressure of 10
centimeters. VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. Pulse was
100 to 120. Blood pressure was 90/75. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation. CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart rate which is regular ,
irregular with S1 and S2 normal , and intermittent S3 , and a II/VI
holosystolic murmur best auscultated at the apex radiating to this
axilla. ABDOMEN: His belly was soft , nontender , nondistended with
active bowel sounds and a palpable liver , approximately , 1.5
centimeters below the costal margin , which was pulsatile.
EXTREMITIES: His extremities were warm and well perfused. Distal
Pulses were 2+. There was no edema.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: BUN of 58. Creatinine of 2.5.
Potassium of 3.8. INR of 5.1.
Hematocrit of 42.8. White count of 8.5.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: His electrocardiogram was notable for atrial
fibrillation of , approximately , 120 with a
zero degree axis and an intraventricular conduction delay; R-wave
progression was poor. He had ST-T wave changes consistent with
digitalis effect. There was no change in this cardiogram compared
to the one in February of 1998.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service , and an amiodarone load was initiated at
400 milligrams four times a day. Endocrinologist Service was
consulted and followed along status post his ablation. The patient
was felt to be euvolemic and slightly hypovolemic upon his
admission , and his diuretics were reduced to 100 twice a day of
Torsemide. After approximately 36 hours with a slight
liberalization of his fluid intake , the patient normalized , and he
became slight hypervolemic. At that time , his diuretic regimen was
returned to his normal outpatient dose of 200 twice a day , and he
received an extra dose of intravenous Torsemide. On the third of
hospitalization , March , 1999 , the patient was cardioverted by
his ICD with 30 joules of synchronous shock , which turned the
patient to sinus rhythm. At this point , he had received three days
of amiodarone at 400 milligrams four times a day. During this
amiodarone load , the patient became markedly nauseated with
episodes of vomiting. It was also noted that he developed some
decreased blood pressure while on the amiodarone attributed to the
negative inotropic effects of the drug. His normal medications
were intermittently held for hypertension , and the patient , at
times , appeared to be quite unwell during his amiodarone load ,
feeling nauseated and relatively hypertensive. However , after the
patient&apos;s medicines were given , he returned to a normal blood
pressure and felt well.
The patient was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm on
March . He will be discharged on amiodarone dose for
maintenance now that his load has been completed. His thyroid
function tests were checked in house subsequent to his ablation ,
and they were notable for a T4 level of 9.6. He is to have his
thyroid function tests rechecked in , approximately , three weeks and
he will be followed in the endocrine clinic as well at that time.
He also is to initiate therapy with Tapazole 10 milligrams a day to
protect the patient from developing hyperthyroidism in the setting
of his amiodarone. The patient&apos;s dose of Coumadin was also held in
house as his INR was elevated. It had fallen to a level of 3.0 on
the day of discharge , and he was discharged on a lower dose of
Coumadin to be adjusted as an outpatient by the anticoagulation
team.
The patient&apos;s renal function returned to baseline , approximately ,
24 hours after admission when he returned to a euvolemic state.
His slightly elevated creatinine was attributed to pre-renal
dehydration. His creatinine on the day of discharge was 1.6 , and
his baseline is , approximately , 1.6 to 2.0. His baseline
insufficiency can be attributed to poor forward flow.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Captopril 75 milligrams q.i.d.
( 2 ) Digoxin 0.125 milligrams q.d.
( 3 ) Isordil 40 milligrams t.i.d. ( 4 ) Amiodarone 200 milligrams
b.i.d. ( 5 ) Torsemide 200 milligrams b.i.d. ( 6 ) Prilosec 20
milligrams bid ( 7 ) Tapazole 10 milligrams q.d. to begin on Monday.
( 8 ) K-Dur as per his outpatient medicines. ( 9 ) Coumadin
3 milligrams q.d. to be adjusted as an outpatient.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will return to the Mowe Memorial Hospital
Hospital early next week to have his electrolytes and
INR checked. He will return in , approximately , three weeks to
have thyroid function tests checked , as previously stated. He has
follow up appointments in both cardiomyopathy clinic and endocrine
clinic , and close follow up with the cardiomyopathy and transplant
team.

Discharge Date: 7/16/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RECENT CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , HYPOKALEMIA ,
AND HYPERTENSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73 year old black
female with a history of diabetes and
hypertension who felt well until October 1992 when she developed an
episode of the flu. Since that time , she has noted persistent
nocturia. Four to five days prior to admission , the patient noted
an increase of shortness of breath requiring her to sleep upright
and increasing peripheral edema. Two days prior to admission the
patient started on Lasix 400 mg b.i.d. with a dramatic decrease in
her shortness of breath and orthopnea. She was able to sleep in
bed the night of admission. She denies chest pain during any of
these episodes. Blood pressure was in the range of 180/90 without
headache , cognitive changes , or hematuria. Patient was admitted to
Rangenor Health Center for hypertension and congestive heart
failure evaluation. She states she does follow a low salt diet and
makes her own soups without salt. She does not eat cold cuts , etc.
She denies elicit drug use , birth control use , or heavy alcohol
use. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for diabetes mellitus for
fourteen years on an oral hyperglycemic agent and hypertension for
the last three years. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for an
appendectomy at age 16 and a hysterectomy at age 47. She has no
children. ALLERGIES: Aspirin which causes gastrointestinal upset.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Inderal 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o.
t.i.d. times two days , K-Dur 10 mEq every day , Tolazamide 250 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , and Hygroton which was stopped one week prior to
admission. SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for a half a pack of
cigarettes for ten years stopped one month ago and rare alcohol
use. FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for her father with diabetes who
died of a massive heart attack at age 48. Her mother had a brain
tumor and died at age 43. She has three brothers who have a
history of obesity , one brother died during cardiac surgery , and
she has two sisters with gallbladder and kidney disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient presented as a
pleasant black female in no apparent
distress. Her blood pressure was 160/96 and she was not
orthostatic. Her pulse was 92 , her respiratory rate was 14 , and
she was afebrile. LUNGS: Examination was clear without wheezes or
rales. CARDIAC: Examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with no murmurs. ABDOMEN: Examination was unremarkable.
EXTREMITIES: Revealed 2+ edema to the mid calves and 2+ pulses
palpable. RECTAL: Examination was hemoccult negative.
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient&apos;s potassium was
2.7 , chloride 92 , CO2 33 , and her
magnesium was 1.6. Her white count was 10 , hematocrit 36.4 , and
platelet count was 313. The patient&apos;s liver function tests were
within normal limits and her chest X-Ray showed no active disease.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute , left
ventricular hypertrophy with strained pattern , and a Q wave in III
as well as flipped T waves in V3 through V6. This was no change
from an EKG in October 1992. The left ventricular hypertrophy was
new since an EKG in February 1987.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had an Endocrine consultation to work
her up for aldosteronemia. The patient had a
24-hour urine which showed no evidence of potassium wasting
bringing some doubt on the hyperaldosterone diagnosis. The
patient&apos;s diabetes was well controlled on the basis of fingerstix.
The patient&apos;s hypertension was controlled by manipulating her
medications. Thyroid work-up revealed a TCH of 2.9 which was
within normal limits. Her electrolytes were managed with potassium
and magnesium replacement as needed. Her cardiac status was
evaluated as the patient occasionally complained of fluttering
feelings which did not correlate with EKG changes or congestive
heart failure. The patient had an exercise thallium test prior to
discharge which was stopped secondary to fatigue and shortness of
breath. There was no chest pain or EKG changes. The plan was for
the patient to have the patient have a Holter as an out-patient.
She is also to have pulmonary function tests as an out-patient.
The Endocrine Service will follow-up on the possible diagnosis of
hyperaldosteronemia. The patient was considered to be stable for
discharge on May , 1992.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Potassium 40 mEq q.d. ,
Lopressor 100 mg t.i.d. , Glyburide 10 mg q.d. ,
Diltiazem SR 120 mg p.o. q.d. , and sublingual Nitrogen 0.3 two to
five minutes apart for smothering feeling. The patient is also
told to maintain a low salt diet. The patient is to follow-up with
Dr. Thad Dall in one week. She is also to follow-up with the
Endocrine Service , Dr. Penza , in two weeks on May .

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain with radiation to left leg.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old black
female who is status post a motor
vehicle accident in approximately 1968 and then again a fall in
1978. She complained of increasing lower back pain with radiation
to the left lower extremity for several months. This pain is now
accompanied by numbness in the left lateral aspect of the upper
leg , lower leg and foot with increasing pain and weakness. She was
unable to stand for long periods of time secondary to the pain and
the weakness and wears a brace on the leg. A CT scan in 1/11
showed spinal stenosis secondary to a disk bulging and facet joint
degeneration at level L4 to L5 with a grade I L4-5
spondylolisthesis and an L5-S1 central disk herniation with a left
nerve root impingement. PAST HISTORY: Hypertension; cardiomegaly;
total abdominal hysterectomy; tonsillectomy; right toe surgery.
She is gravida 0. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Isordil 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; Dyazide 50 mg p.o. daily. ALLERGIES: Aspirin causes GI
bleeding. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke; moderate alcohol.
No dietary restrictions. She is a divorced retired laundry worker.
FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension and myocardial
infarction. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unremarkable except for dyspnea on
exertion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and the complaints noted
above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile; vital signs stable; height 5&apos;11&quot;;
weight 185 pounds. She presented as a
moderately obese black female in no apparent distress. The skin
was clear. The nodes were normal. The extraocular motions were
intact; pupils equal , round and reactive to light. The oropharynx
was benign. The lungs were clear. The cardiac exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm; S1 and S2; no rubs , murmurs or gallops.
The peripheral pulses were intact. The abdomen was obese; positive
bowel sounds; no masses or organomegaly noted. Cranial nerves
II-XII were intact. Motor was grossly intact. Sensation was
decreased in the distal left lower extremity. She had global
hyperreflexia. Toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had a
positive left straight leg raise causing lower back pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
11/12/90 , where she underwent an L3-4-5 spinal
decompression laminectomy for spinal stenosis. At surgery there
was no any significant disk bulging noted , therefore , a diskectomy
was not performed. Postoperatively she did very well. Her only
significant complaint was of a burning sensation in the left
lateral thigh and occasionally in the right lateral thigh episodic
in nature. She claimed that she had had a burned injury to her
left lateral thigh in the past that had caused these burning
sensations to exist prior to her recent surgery. These sensations
were also relieved somewhat by ambulating , and it was felt that she
may have had some transient pressure on her lateral cutaneous
nerves during surgery and during her bedridden course following the
operation.
DISPOSITION: She was discharged following physical therapy
treatment on 3/11/90. FOLLOW UP will be in three
weeks in the orthopedic clinic with Dr. Dejulio MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Same as on admission plus Tylenol #3.

Discharge Date: 10/24/2000
SERVICE: The service on which the patient received care was
Cardiology Broketroit Ma Ri
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Wetterauer is a 54-year-old female
with coronary artery disease status
post inferior myocardial infarction in October of 1997 , with sick
sinus syndrome , status post permanent pacemaker placement , and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation controlled with amiodarone; also
with history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was
admitted to the Crotamp Hospital for severe respiratory
distress on 7/10 The summary of clinical events is as follows.
The evening of 7/11 , the patient was having intercourse and
&quot;collapsed.&quot; She was very short of breath with this , and presented
to the Emergency Department via the paramedics. They attempted to
intubate her on the field and found her pulse oxygen to be about 60
percent on bag valve mask. They were unable to do so. She was
described during this episode by her husband as to have been
&quot;gurgling.&quot; She began to describe shortness of breath , and took
her inhalers which did not help. She began to cough quite a bit
and coughed up some frothy white sputum. At the Emergency
Department , she was immediately intubated at Sirose
There was some difficulty intubating her , and she was ultimately
intubated by the attending anesthesiologist there. An
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30 percent with
flat CKs. She was diuresed six liters with a stable BUN and
creatinine and was extubated on 10/11 A right heart
catheterization there showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 40/15 ,
wedge of 12 , cardiac output of 5.2. Hemodymanics in the Intensive
Care Unit at Chebanks Hospital indicate the patient&apos;s cardiac output
was quite dependent on her SVR. Her cardiac index fell into the
high two&apos;s when her SVR was in the 1340 range , but jumped up into
the high three&apos;s at about 3.8 when her SVR was much lower down in
the 800s. At the outside hospital , a right upper lobe infiltrate
was also noted and she was given gentamicin 250 mg times one , and
clindamycin 600 mg. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated
with clindamycin , this caused resolution of her white count at the
outside hospital. She also had an increase in her Lasix and
lisinopril dose there , as well as her amiodarone. She was started
on Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma.
She did quite well after her treatment for pneumonia and treatment
for pulmonary edema , and was transferred to the Misutch University Hospital for further management.
Her last admission was on 2/7 to the Ceter Medical Center
for atypical chest pain , when she had a nondiagnostic exercise
tolerance test. She went 6 minutes and 19 seconds with a maximum
heart rate of 94. Her chest pain then was ultimately attributed to
a gastrointestinal cause.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post inferior
myocardial infarction on 4/27 She was last
admitted , as noted above , on 2/7 to the Lordchild Hospital for atypical
chest pain. The patient has sick sinus syndrome and is status post
dual chamber pacemaker in 6/19 Diabetes mellitus. Hypertension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , well-controlled in the past on
amiodarone. Past rhythm monitoring has revealed brief runs of
ventricular tachycardia. Negative breast biopsy in 3/13
MEDICATIONS: Home medications include amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Prempro 0.625/2.5 p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Coumadin , nitroglycerin sublingual , Zantac , beclomethasone , and
Ventolin.
Medications on transfer , Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 p.o.
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , clindamycin 600 intravenous
q.8 , digoxin 0.25 , Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. , Zantac , Albuterol ,
Flovent , Solu-Medrol , and amiodarone 300 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a ten pack year smoking history
and quit in 1968. No intravenous drug use. She
is retired from Medical Records at SGH . She has three grown
children and she is married.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission is
significant for a blood pressure of 114/93 ,
this is down from a very high blood pressure on admission at the
outside hospital which was in the 200s. Pulse is 60 , temperature
is 96.5 , saturating 97 percent on two liters. General , this is an
agitated woman in no acute distress. Her neck veins were about 5.0
to 6.0 cm of water. The lung examination showed a few crackles in
the left base with the right one clear. Cardiovascular examination
revealed a split S1 and normal S2 , also a soft S3 , the presence of
a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border
was noted. The abdomen was benign , no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The extremities showed no edema , with intact distal pulses.
Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented times three with
no focal deficits , but careful neurologic examination was
impossible due to severe agitation and anxiety.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory on admission was significant for a
Troponin of 0.02 , CK of 80 , INR of 1.3 ,
hematocrit of 38.0 , BUN/creatinine of 24/0.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Digerolamo was admitted to the Aley Coness-o Meoak Medical Center and managed by problems as follows.
Flash Pulmonary Edema: The initial concern for Mrs. Kozicki was of
this being an ischemic event causing her to have flash pulmonary
edema. However , coronary catheterization revealed the patient to
have clean coronaries. Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular
hypertrophy with a low normal systolic function , with an ejection
fraction of 50 to 55 percent. There was akinesis of the inferior
wall present. She had normal right ventricular size and function.
She had 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation with mild left atrial
enlargement and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitive
velocity of about 2.7 meters per second consistent with minimal
pulmonary systolic pressures. Subsequently the patient was noted
to have had a history of hypothyroidism in the past , and she had
normal TSH recently checked by her primary care physician , Dr.
Slipper , of TCH . However , with no other etiology present , we
were worried about the patient having had tachyarrhythmia from some
other source causing this. The Electrophysiology Service
interrogated the patient&apos;s pacer which revealed a number of
tachyarrhythmias. A TSH panel was checked which revealed a TSH of
less than assay , and T4 free thyroxin index elevated. An
Endocrinology consultation was obtained , and they believed that the
patient&apos;s thyrotoxicosis was amiodarone induced. She was started
on Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. They also suggested prednisone , but
the patient did refuse this. They recommended follow-up with
Endocrine in about four to six weeks. Therefore , the final
etiology for the patient&apos;s flash pulmonary edema was amiodarone
induced thyrotoxicosis causing increased susceptibility to
tachyarrhythmia , left ventricular hypertrophy , and possible
diastolic dysfunction , resulting in acute pump dysfunction , causing
flash pulmonary edema. The final therapy for this problem will
consist of heavy nodal blockade. The patient will be blockaded
with calcium channel blockers , as well as Lopressor.
Pneumonia: The patient was treated with clindamycin and did quite
well. Her white count fully resolved and she had no fever or other
symptoms of pneumonia. She will be discharged without any further
antibiotics.
Urinary Tract Infection: She had a lot of uric crystals , therefore
she was placed on Bactrim Double Strength b.i.d. times a total of
seven days.
Psychiatry: The patient has clearly severe anxiety and was in a
full panic attack on admission. She was treated acutely with
Ativan and her problem resolved quite well , and she became more
comfortable in the hospital.
Diabetes Mellitus: Glyburide was held initially on admission. She
was covered with insulin sliding scale. Glyburide was restarted on
the day of discharge. The patient was noted to have relatively
high blood sugars , and these should be followed as an outpatient.
Blood sugars as high as the mid 300s were noted.
Edema: The patient clearly had some fluid accumulation which
resolved with 20 mg of Lasix p.o. q.d. We will continue this and
allow outpatient follow-up to determine whether or not she will
need this in the future.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 5.0
mg p.o. q.p.m. , Bactrim Double Strength one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
times four days after discharge , Prempro 0.625/2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 150 mg
p.o. q.d. , diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in good condition.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Thyrotoxicosis.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. Provins on Monday , 9/18
at 9:30 a.m. , and Dr. Orejel of Chia Memorial Hospital Endocrinology at U Hay Rill , on 7/16 at 3:00
p.m.

hypokinesis with regional variation. The right ventricular
systolic function mildly reduced. Mild left atrial enlargement.
Mild pre-dilated right atrium. Moderately thickened aortic
valve. Mildly diffusely thickened mitral valve.
PROCEDURES: On 10/10/06 : IVC filter placement without
complication by Dr. Zachary Stovel
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 85-year-old woman with a
history of prior DVTs and lower lobe lung mass , biopsy shown to
be a thymoma , who presents with bilateral pulmonary emboli and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Hematology: The patient has bilateral pulmonary emboli as
confirmed by PE protocol CT. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with heparin drip for PTT goal of 60-80 , and was
bridged to Coumadin with an INR goal of 2-2.5. Lower extremity
noninvasive studies showed right leg deep venous thrombosis as
noted above. An IVC filter was placed without complications on
10/18/06. The patient was discharged on a Coumadin dose of 7.5
mg by mouth daily , and her INR will be followed by the Bit University Medical Center Coumadin Clinic ( Dr. Kent Ahlo ) , after
her discharge from rehabilitation.
Cardiovascular: Rhythm: The patient was initially found to be
in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response , with a
heart rate of approximately 128 beats per minute. This was felt
likely to be secondary to pulmonary embolus. The patient
required both metoprolol and diltiazem for rate and rhythm
control , and was discharged on both of these medications. She
had several episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation throughout her
hospital course , requiring several boluses to metoprolol IV and
diltiazem IV. She was discharged on a regimen of metoprolol and
diltiazem p.o. to maintain her in stable normal sinus.
Pump: The patient had an echocardiogram revealing ejection
fraction of 15% while she was in atrial fibrillation , and
ejection fraction of 25% when the patient was in normal sinus
rhythm. She was diuresed gently with Lasix 20 mg by mouth daily.
She was started on low-dose ACE inhibitor on 8/11/06.
Ischemia: The patient has risk factors for coronary artery
disease , but has no chest pain or significant EKG changes during
this admission. She may be considered for cardiac
catheterization in the future as an outpatient.
Endocrine: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus with a
hemoglobin A1c of 8.2. Oral anti-diabetics were held during this
admission , the patient was given basal and prandial insulin. She
was discharged back on her home diabetes regimen.
Onch: The patient has a right lower lobe lung mass which is
likely thymoma by a fine needle aspirate. The patient was seen
by the Thoracic Surgery Service , as follow up for Dr. Evilsizer
who had seen her in clinic , and depending of the services that
surgery was not recommended at this time until cardiovascular and
pulmonary issues were stabilized. Medical oncology was also
consulted , and it was recommended that chemotherapy would not be
pursued at this time for this patient. Both services recommended
a followup CT scan in several weeks to detect the progression of
this right lower lobe lung mass. The decision of whether or not
to treat this lung mass will be deferred until her pulmonary
embolism , cardiovascular , and pulmonary issues are stabilized.
Neuro: The patient has a history of drinking two to four drinks
per day , but the patient did not have any signs or symptoms of
alcohol withdrawal during this admission.
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was repeated
with electrolytes as necessary. She was given a cardiac and
American Diabetes Association Diet.
Prophylaxis: The patient was initially on heparin , which in turn
was bridged to Coumadin.
The patient was full code during this admission.
PLANS: The patient should have regular blood draws to monitor
her INR level while she is taking Coumadin. This will be managed
by the Sher-pa Meroo Hase General Hospital Coumadin Clinic run by Dr.
Cristobal Buckhanon , phone number 107-568-5779 while the patient is
an outpatient. The patient should have diltiazem weaned off as
tolerated. ACE inhibitor and metoprolol should be titrated
upwards as tolerated by heart rate and blood pressure. The
patient has followup appointments scheduled with Dr. Grant Bayley at Liy Hospital Cardiology on 4/29/07
at 9:40 a.m. , the phone number 776-170-8696. The patient also
has a followup appointment with Dr. Quinton Menjares at the
Ton St.coke Hospital Thoracic Surgery Group on 1/25/07
at 1:00 p.m. Telephone number is 816-031-8787.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Will be dictated in the discharge summary
addendum.

Discharge Date: 5/14/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INFECTION/RULE OUT ENDOCARDITIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) STATUS POST STAPHYLOCOCCUS ENDOCARDITIS
IN March 1995.
2 ) STATUS POST AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT
TIMES THREE WITH ST. JUDE IN April 1995.
3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65 year old man with a
history of rheumatic heart disease
status post aortic valve replacement times three who suffered acute
bacterial endocarditis ( Staphylococcus aureus , not MRSA ) in 5/26
He presented with nausea , vomiting times one , &quot;a black out&quot; ,
weakness , and temperature of 101.2 the morning of admission. This
patient was admitted back on 10/5/95 with fever times five days ,
nasal congestion , and change in mental status. He was found in bed
with fecal incontinence and increased confusion at that time. Back
in October 1995 , the initial TE showed no vegetation. He was
treated with Cefotaxime and Vancomycin. Patient subsequently
developed atrial fibrillation with congestive heart failure and the
hypertension. On October , he was intubated at which time a TE
showed aortic vegetations. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus
aureus and the antibiotics were changed to Oxacillin and
Tobramycin. Patient underwent a high risk redo aortic valve
replacement with St. Jude mechanical valve because of persistent
sepsis. The antibiotics were narrowed to Oxacillin. Patient had a
number of septic embolic events and emboli were thrown to the brain
with a right MCA stroke and the spleen as well as the duodenum. On
2/30 , he had an elevated white count , increasing temperature , and
increasing renal failure. At that time , the CT showed these renal
and splenic abscesses and patient was taken to the Operating Room.
He underwent a splenectomy and was found to have a perforated
duodenal ulcer. He underwent vagotomy with pyeloplasty. The
spleen showed multiple abscesses which grew out Candida. On this
admission , the patient was in his usual state of good health until
one week prior to admission when he experienced fatigue. At
baseline , the patient experienced intermittent sharp chest pain
felt to be musculoskeletal secondary to open thoracic surgery.
Patient also experienced pins and needle feelings felt in both
hands. On the night prior to admission , the patient sneezed
experiencing increased back pain. Later that night , he awoke
diaphoretic with aches and pains in the legs. Patient was sick in
the stomach but believed he would feel better if he ate watermelon
whereupon finishing , he had nausea and vomiting times one. Patient
went back to bed and awoke with joint pain throughout with
temperature at 7 a.m. on 100.1 degrees. Later while sitting in a
chair trying to dress , he stood and things started &quot;to go black&quot;.
He walked towards the bathroom , got weak , knew he was going down ,
avoided falling down the stairs , and landed on all fours on his
hands and knees. Patient denied head trauma and suffered no
injury. He had no loss of continence or seizure activity. Patient
got up and moved to the bathroom under his own power. He had a
small bowel movement and felt better. Wife returned home and
temperature at 9 a.m. was 101.2. Patient was taken to Ertj. Health Urgent Care Center. At CTACH , he received blood cultures times
two and blood tests before being brought to the Gra Forro Memorial Hospital Emergency Room. Patient denied any recent cough , sore
throat , dysuria , and hematuria but did note increased nasal
congestion and shortness of breath over the past month.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) History of rheumatic heart disease with
aortic valve replacement times three in
3/26 , 1981 , and 5/26 2 ) Acute Staphylococcus aureus bacterial
endocarditis with septic emboli to brain , kidney , and spleen in

mg b.i.d. , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 5 mg
q.h.s. , Senokot two tablets b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , and
Coumadin 4 alternating with 5 mg q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco of three packs per day times thirty years
and alcohol quit fifteen years ago. The patient
was unemployed on disability , he was a painter&apos;s rigger , and
married times 24 years with four children from his first wife , now
living with his second wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient&apos;s temperature was 101.6 , blood
pressure 96/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations
28. HEENT: Pupils were equal and reactive to light and
accommodation , extraocular muscles were intact , normal funduscopic
examination , no Roth spots were noted , the oropharynx was benign ,
and no petechiae were noted. NECK: Supple and there was no
lymphadenopathy , his jugular venous distention was absent , an EJ
line was in place , and there was a 2+ carotid with zero bruits.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regular rate
and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and there was a holosystolic II/VI systolic
murmur at the left sternal border with no S3 or S4 noted. There
was a very crisp click from the St. Jude aortic valve. ABDOMEN:
Examination showed positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , and
non-distended. RECTAL: Refused by patient. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented times
three , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , motor was 5/5 in all four
extremities distally and proximally , sensory was normal to light
touch and proprioception , and the reflexes were equal and
symmetric. Cerebellar was slow , equal repetitive motions , and the
F&amp;F was slow but equal with good tracking grossly.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , his white count was 19.1 with 18
bands and 53 polys , hematocrit was 41.8 ,
and the electrolytes were all within normal range. The bilirubins
were 0.8 total , alkaline phosphatase 82 , SGPT of 15 , and his PT was
20.7 with an INR of 3.4. A transthoracic echo obtained upon
admission showed the aortic valve was in place , there was a 2.9
meters per second flow through the aortic valve , and there was no
abscess or vegetation noted. Patient had reportedly gotten two
blood cultures in Ari Norer Legulf Hospital and it turned out later that there
had only been one blood draw. One blood culture was also drawn in
the Emergency Room at the Thoter Coast Community Healthcare . Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly , no infiltrate , and no congestive heart
failure and his EKG at admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 89
with an axis of minus 20 , intervals were 0.26/0.90/0.36 , there was
a flipped T in lead I , aVL , V5 , and V6 , and there was first degree
AV block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65 year old gentleman who had had three
aortic valve replacements and had suffered
overwhelming endocarditis as recently as six months ago in the
replaced St. Jude valve at that time with a high risk valve since
patient was known to be febrile at the time of valve replacement.
Therefore , the number one problem was to rule out endocarditis.
The patient had two blood cultures , one at the Acraw Medical Center and one
at Ter&apos;svenwhi Rywick Hospital , which were negative times 48 hours
while the patient was maintained on Vancomycin and Gentamicin. It
was judged that a TE would not change our treatment for this
gentleman and it was not obtained. An Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained and Infectious Disease recommended
observing the patient on antibiotics for an extra 24 hours before
deeming him non-bacteremic and then to observe the gentleman off
antibiotics for 24 hours before discharging him. In regards to
anti-coagulation , the patient was targeted for an INR of 3 with a
high risk prosthetic heart valve. This was easily maintained using
the patient&apos;s normal alternating 4 and 5 mg q.p.m. Coumadin. Final
issue was the patient&apos;s fall. It was judged that the patient
actually became weak and went down on all fours controlling his
fall without actual syncope. The weakness could be attributed to
the patient&apos;s nausea , vomiting , dehydration , and vasovagal. Final
issue was the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. While the
patient was hospitalized , the Glyburide was held and patient was
maintained on a sliding scale of insulin. Patient&apos;s blood cultures
remained negative times three days while patient was treated with
Vancomycin and Gentamicin. As per Infectious Disease
recommendations , the intravenous antibiotics were held on the third
day and then patient was observed for 24 hours off antibiotics. He
continued to remain afebrile through the entire hospitalization and
patient was discharged to home on September .
DISPOSITION: Disposition is to home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,
Ventolin two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
Beclovent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. , Beconase two puffs inhaled
q.i.d. p.r.n. congestion , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Meclizine 25
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Senokot tablets two
tablets p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.o.d. alternating with 5
mg p.o. q.o.d. , every day , patient took either 4 or 5 alternating ,
and Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Patient was not discharged on any
antibiotics.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
FOLLOW-UP: Arranged with his attending , Dr. Andre Raju for the
following week. Patient was also arranged to have an
MRI scan of his spine on Wednesday , 6/6 , at noon. This is to
rule out possibilities of osteomyelitis since patient had had low
back pain since septic events of 5/26

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest pain
HPI: 69y/o female w/ MMP , including CHF ( EF=50% 10/6/04 ) , NIDDM , Afib ,
and mult CVAs , was in her USOH until 8am the DOA , when she was observed
to have twitches in her eyes and mouth; during this episode , the pt.
was A&amp;OX3/no LOC. Per report , she has not had these sx previously. VS
at the time were stable. At 8:45 am per report , the pt began moaning
and complained of left sided chest pain localized to her breast. Her
skin was noted to be clammy. The pt. reports no radiation of sx , SOB ,
N/V , palpitations , or dizziness. Proxy did note that pt had a
&quot;congestive cough&quot; for past week. VS at nursing home durnig episode of
chest pain were P57-92 , BP 104/70 , O2 98%RA. Pt then brought to the RMH
ED , where she no longer c/o sx but was found to be tachy in afib w/
HR 120s-130s. In ED VS: T 99.2; BP 129/116; RR14; O2 99%RA. PE notable
for cataracts b/l , CN intact , lungs CTA b/l , CVS tachy , ?S4 , abd s/nt ,
ext www , no edema. Pt. unable to cooperate for full neurological exam.
Labs notable for K of 5.4 , Ca of 8.1 , and WCT of 15.02. EKG:tachy at
111 , reg rhythm ?sinus vs. atrial flutter. .5mm ST depression in V5 , no
TW changes , QW in 3 , aVF ( unchanged ). CXR: No evidence of pulm edema/
infiltrate. Pt given 50 mg PO lopressor and 5mg IV lopressor X 4 w/
persistent tachycardia to the low 100s.
ASSESSMENT: 69 y/o female with h/o CHF , DM , tachyarrhythmias , and CVAs
presents w/ chest pain , facial twitching. Pt admitted for stabilization
of HR and r/o MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) CARDS:
Ischemia: Pt ruled out by enzymes/EKG X3. Did not complain of CP/ SOB
during admission. On ASA , Beta blocker
Pump: H/o CHF w/ EF 50-55% in 7/19/04. No evidence of volume overload
by PE , CXR. On lasix 20 mg po qd. Repeat ECHO 11/8/04 showed a mild
interval reduction in LV EF down to 35-40% without significant
valvular abnormalities.
Rhythm: Pt tachy to 110s on admission but hemodynamically stable. O/N
HD1 had episode of afib at 130s-140s , desat to 88%. No complaints of
CP. Given diltiazem 10 mg IV w/ return of HR to low 100s ( baseline ).
Started diltiazem 30 mg po QID w/ drop in HR to 70s-80s , w/ irregular
rhythm. Per EKG , ?sinus arrhythmia vs ?atrial fibrillation w/ normal
rate. TSH pending. On HD4 , pt. had episode of bradycardia down to 50s
( approximately 1 hour ) asymptomatic with no evidence of heart block.
Toprol XL was restarted at home dose ( 100 mg qd ) , and diltiazem was
kept at qid dosing upon discharge. Given the brief episode of
bradycardia and concerns for both bradycardia and heart block , it was
decided to place a continuous loop monitor on the patient. She will
follow up in outpatient cardiology on November and with her PCP on
November
2 ) NEURO: Has hx of CVA. Head CT on 8/17/04 shows old infarct , no new
lesion. Per proxy , pt. back to baseline mental status upon admission.
No episodes of facial twitching during admission. On aricept.
3 ) ID: WCT 15.03 w/ 86% PMNs. Pt afebrile , no evidence of infection.
Given hx. of cough , a sputum gs/cx were done and were negative. WCT
down to 8.03 by discharge. Pt. on prednisone for temporal arteritis;
this may have been the cause of the WCT elevation , but this is
unlikely as WCT dropped by discharge.
4 ) ENDO: On metformin 850 mg BID for DM. In addition , had pt. on
sliding scale insuling during admission.
5 ) FEN: Potassium initially elevated , but down to 3.8 by discharge; No
EKG changes were observed. Ca was low , and was repleted - it may have
been responsible for facial twitches. On ADA diet.
6 ) RHEUM: H/o temporal arteritis. Continued prednisone 10mg qd. ESR
rechecked on day of discharge per Dr. Newberg To be followed up
as outpatient.
7 ) CODE: FC. *Per Health proxy , Jackie Bhatia ( phone
857-284-3232 ) , pt&apos;s code status had changed to FC after being years of
DNR/DNI. Code status was revisited this hospitalization , and Ms.
Points requested that the pt. be full code. Discussed issue
with Dr. Ollhoff , who will revisit this issue with the patient and
proxy at her next appt.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please continue to take your home medications. We have added a new
medication , Diltiazem , which you need to take four times a day. In
two days , you should receive a portable heart monitor that will record
your heart rhythms continuously for one month.
Please schedule an appt. to see Dr. Mclaine within 1 week. You should see
Dr. Waylon Back in cardiology on November at 1:30 p.m. and Dr.
Guariglia on June at 1:50 p.m. If you have chest pain , shortness
of breath , dizziness , weakness , or other symptoms go to the ER.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Pt. to follow up with Dr. Peloquin on 9/17/04 at 3:50 p.m. For HR
control , pt. started on diltiazem 30 mg QID. Will likely transition to
long-acting diltiazem as an outpatient. Pt has been scheduled to see
Dr. Mcgrue in cardiology for consideration of amio for heart rate
control. Pt to be sent home with loop monitor for possible
bradycardia/heart block on nodal agents.

1989 and being followed by a cardiologist in Prora who
presented to Stem,delfgilm Hospital in Nah Coton- An on 9/27/06 with chest pain
and shortness breath. Until 3/22 , he had been feeling generally
well without limiting dyspnea , fatigue , or chest pain. Since
then he has had two inpatient admissions in Hay Irv Co for
CHF. He complains of marked increase in dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue as well as PND/nocturia for the past three to four
months. He developed chest pressure and shortness of breath in

with critical coronary anatomy/valve dysfunction. There is a
history of class III heart failure. Recent signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure include paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea/dyspnea on exertion/pulmonary edema on chest x-ray/pedal
edema. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter treated with drugs/beta
blocker.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA: Chemistries: Sodium 134 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , CO2 27 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 113 , and magnesium 2.0. Hematology: WBC 9.43 ,
hematocrit 38.2 , hemoglobin 13.5 , platelets 126 , 000 , PT 15.9 , INR
1.3 , PTT 76.1. UA was normal. Cardiac catheterization data from
5/23/06 performed at AH showed coronary anatomy 60% proximal
LAD , 70% ostial D1 , left dominant circulation. Echo from
2/21/06 showed 55% ejection fraction , aortic stenosis , mean
gradient 80 mmHg , peak gradient 121 mmHg , calculated valve area
0.4 sq cm , moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid
insufficiency , left ventricular enlargement , hypertrophied with
reasonable systolic function , severe aortic stenosis , and
moderate mitral regurgitation. There is a markedly left atrial
enlargement , which is probably secondary to pulmonary
hypertension. EKG from 3/15/06 showed atrial fibrillation rate
of 78 , septal infarct. Chest x-ray from 10/3/06 was consistent
with CHF. The lungs are well expanded , stable. Multiple chamber
cardiac enlargement is seen. The bilateral small pleural
effusions decreased in size. No pneumothorax was identified. No
focal consolidation was seen. The patient was admitted to CSS
and stabilized for surgery.
DATE OF SURGERY: 8/16/06.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: CAD , AS , MR.
PROCEDURE: An ascending aortic resection/AVR with a 23 CE
pericardial valve , MVP with 38 CE ring and ring annuloplasty ,
CABG x1 SVG1 to LAD and LAD endarterectomy.
BYPASS TIME: 303 minutes.
CROSSCLAMP TIME: 225 minutes.
CIRC ARREST: 7 minutes.
There were no complications. The patient was transferred to the
unit in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. On postop
day #1 in the unit , chest x-ray/EKG within normal limits ,
bilateral lower extremities mottled to stable , good pedal pulses
bilaterally. Continuing to monitor. On postop day #2 ,
hematocrit 25.3 , transfused two units PRBC. Hemodynamically
stable. On postop day #3 , extubated , off pressors. Failed video
swallow evaluation. He was transferred to Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: No issues.
Cardiovascular: No issues. On aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Respiratory: No issues. Have been extubated on postop day #2.
GI: N.p.o. Video swallow showed aspiration. Nutrition will
continue to follow with recommendations.
Renal: No issues.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulated with aspirin and Coumadin. Recent
mitral valve repair/atrial fib.
ID: No issues.
Of note , recent video swallow , the patient needs Dobbhoff tubes
for meds p.o. until Nutrition gives further Rx.
On the Step-Down Unit , starting postop day #3 , no narcotics. An
88-year-old status post circ arrest confused , impulsive and on
sitter , Pacing wire remains in place.
On postop day #4 , rate controlled A fib , hypertensive , added
low-dose captopril to Lopressor 12.5 q.i.d. , diuresing well ,
remains on 1.5 L O2 , strict n.p.o. for aspiration per Speech and
Swallow. On tube feeds via Dobbhoff , confusion improving , no
narcotics/sedatives. UA sent for MS changes , negative for UTI.
Wires discontinued. Coumadin for A fib. Rehabilitation
screening initiated.
On postop day #5 , rate controlled A fib , Coumadin. BP still
hypertensive , increased captopril to 12.5 t.i.d. Ambulating with
PT on room air. Dobbhoff in place. All meds/nutrition via
Dobbhoff. Postop echo ordered for MVP. Off sitters today , clear
mental status. No narcotics/sedatives. UA clean.
On postop day #6 , rate controlled A fib. BP improved on
captopril. Cards following , recommending to preferentially
increase Lopressor and decrease captopril as tolerated. Of note ,
the patient has been quite hypertensive this week with heart rate
well controlled even low-dose Lopressor. Increased Lopressor to
25 mg q.i.d. , captopril 12.5 t.i.d. Creatinine 0.4 , has diuresed
well. Postop echo with an EF of 45% to 50% , moderate LVH ,
hypokinetic anterior septal and inferior wall , normal RV. Severe
LAE and RAE , paravalvular leak seen at AVR with mild AI , trace
MR , mild TR. Also has large left pleural effusion , was seen on
echo. Only small bilateral effusions were seen on chest x-ray.
The patient&apos;s main issue now is PT and Speech and Swallow
reassessment. Dobbhoff was repositioned today for tube in
stomach with tip newly pointing upwards into the esophagus.
Post-repositioning KUB shows tip now downwards in stomach. Given
some Reglan to advance. Clear mental status. Junky cough cannot
produce sputum for sample. Afebrile. White count 9.8.
Nutrition and EMS Rx followed , has recovered very well ,
ambulating on room air.
On postop day #7 , repeat video swallow scheduled for Monday.
Coumadin started. Coumadin continued and started Plavix for LAD
endarterectomy , off aspirin. Possible PEG placement pending
video swallow results. Repeat chest x-ray with minimal left
effusion.
On postop day #8 , holding Coumadin for possible PEG next week
pending video swallow on Monday. No heparin for now per Dr.
Ernesto Umbel
On postop day #9 , tube feeds off at midnight , getting repeat
video swallow on a.m. for speech and swallow. Holding Coumadin ,
which was given for chronic A fib pending possible PEG placement.
On postop day #10 , A fib/room air. Video swallow study showed
improvement , but patient still silently aspirating. Speech and
swallow recommends PEG and continued work with Speech and Swallow
for eventual goal of patient taking p.o.&apos;s. Contacted Metabolic
Support. They will send someone to evaluate the patient for PEG ,
so the procedure will likely take place on Wednesday or Thursday.
On postop day #11 , A fib/room air , feeding tubes were part way
out , readvanced and got KUB showing good placement. Metabolic
support evaluated the patient , got consent for PEG.
On postop day #12 , A fib/room air , holding tube feeds and
Coumadin for PEG placement , scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday. No
heparin per Dr. Christman May go to rehab once INR therapeutic for
A fib. The patient had a four-beat run of VT.
On postop day #13 , he was supposed to have PEG placed today.
Metabolic support said that someone called the OR desk yesterday
and canceled the procedure , so it was rescheduled for Tuesday due
to no OR availability. Otherwise , the patient was supposed to
have repeat video swallow next week. Hemodynamically stable.
Holding Coumadin. Rehabilitation when ready.
On postop day #14 , PEG tube placement rescheduled for next
Tuesday , giving low-dose Coumadin for A fib , at goal tube feeds
through Dobhoff , hemodynamically stable.
On postop day #15 , doing well. General surgery consult called to
try and get PEG placed earlier the next Tuesday. Dr. Len Dechart will do it either tomorrow or Monday at the latest.
Otherwise , doing well , n.p.o. after midnight. Hopefully , he will
get PEG and can go to rehabilitation.
On postop day #16 , tube feeding restarted. PEG placement
tomorrow. Otherwise , doing well , rate controlled A fib.
Rehabilitation once PEG tube placed.
On postop day #17 , finally received peg today , currently on D5 in
a half at 50 mL an hour , okay to give meds through PEG and can
restart tube feeds tomorrow. NG tube out. Coumadin to restart
tonight. PT/rehabilitation screening.
On postop day #18 , started tube feeds this morning , advancing
rate without difficulty. The patient ambulating with assistance ,
rate controlled A fib/2 L O2 stable. Plan to rehab tomorrow.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: LINAHAN , OMER M.D.
PRINCIPLE ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Bacteremia , peri-sepsis and
apnea.
PRINCIPLE DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Bacteremia , peri-sepsis and
apnea , as well as failure to tolerate p.o. diets.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He is an 81-year-old man primarily
Russian-speaking , with a history of multiple medical problems
including coronary artery disease status post an MI in 2004 as
well as a cath at the same time with percutaneous intervention ,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45-50% ,
atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and a partial pacemaker
for sick sinus syndrome , multiple strokes x4 , diabetes mellitus
type 2 and COPD , who was recently admitted to the Ghampemaw A Hospital for
bacteremia with Streptococcus oralis without a clear source. His
white blood cell count had increased to 20. His INR had been
supratherapeutic on admission at that time to 14. At that time ,
he had had a transesophageal echocardiogram which did not show
any vegetations and he was discharged to rehab on 3/15/06 with a
course of IV penicillin through a PICC line , as well as oral
Flagyl empirically for an elevated white count. At the rehab
facility where he was placed , the patient was found to have
pulled his PICC line and the patient was complaining of being
short of breath and having some mental status changes. He was
treated with some sublingual nitroglycerin at the outside
facility and brought to the Ellwis Medical Center Emergency Room , where a chest
x-ray showed some lack of the PICC line and the short of breath
quickly improved in the emergency room. He was , however ,
lethargic and then at times , apneic in the emergency room. A gas
was performed which showed respiratory alkalosis with a pH of
7.5 , a pCO2 of 34 and a pAO2 of 135. The patient then became
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures to the 90s ,
was given IV fluid boluses as well as treated empirically with
vancomycin and ceftazidime , to which his blood pressure responded
by going up to around 100-110/60. Given his apnea , a CPAP was
initiated in the emergency department and his oxygenation issues
quickly resolved. A head CT was performed , which was negative.
A right internal jugular line was placed and gentle rehydration
therapy according to early goal-directed therapy for peri-sepsis
was initiated , given the presumption of repeat bacteremia and
early sepsis. He was admitted to medicine for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
2004 and a cath in 2005. He is status post a hip fracture in
2005. He has peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , COPD but not
reported to be on any home oxygenation , dementia , Paget disease ,
atrial fibrillation , BPH , congestive heart failure , EF of 45-50% ,
hypertension , diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included the following: Glucotrol 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , metformin 500 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x10 days which was started
on 5/5/06 , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. , nystatin suspension
q.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q. h.s. , Penicillin G 3 million units
IV q. 4h x7 days , Milk of Magnesia , Tylenol p.r.n. , Dulcolax
p.r.n. , Colace p.r.n. , atenolol 50 mg q. day , Lipitor 20 mg q.
day , Senna liquid q. h.s. , Flomax 0.4 q. day.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of heavy tobacco use. He quit
40 years ago. He lives at home with a 24-hour attendant and he
rarely uses alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM notable for the following: His
temperature was 95.9 , his heart rate was 60 , his blood pressure
was 110/62. He is satting 98% on a CPAP machine. In general , he
was in no acute distress in restraints. His head and neck exam
was notable for a supple neck. Pupils are equal , round and
reactive. His heart demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm. His
JVP was flat. He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. His pulmonary exam was clear anteriorly. His abdominal
exam was noted for being soft , nontender , and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and mild tympani. He had good peripheral
pulses with trace lower extremity edema. His neuro exam was
nonfocal.
OPERATIONS: During his hospital stay at this time included a PEG
tube placement which happened on 10/25/06.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. ID: The patient has a history of recent strep oralis
bacteremia and leukocytosis. He was afebrile at the time of
admission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis given
his blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids and
antibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. His chest x-ray
looked like it might have some aspiration and he was treated with
an empiric 7-day course of Ceptaz and Flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia. This course was completed earlier in his hospital
stay. He was also initially treated with vancomycin. A PICC was
placed on 8/7/06 for further antibiotic management of his
bacteremia. His vancomycin was switched to IV penicillin and
this will be continued for a full 3-4 week course on 1/15/07. A
TEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was going
to be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. All blood ,
urine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth to
date at the time of discharge.
2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated some
apnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP;
however , given the fact that the patient was a significant
aspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possibly
would increase the risk of aspiration. Pulmonary was consulted ,
who felt that the patient was demonstrating Cheyne-Stokes
respirations secondary to possible CHF or history of CVAs that he
has had in the past. His ABG , as I mentioned above , demonstrated
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likely
indicates a chronic process. He did not demonstrate any PEs on
studies that were performed here. No pneumonia was noted and the
desaturations that were detected while the patient was sleeping
overnight on 15 units O2 sat monitor resolved quickly with 2
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A plan was made to not
reinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. He was initially
diuresed mildly with Lasix. This was eventually discontinued.
The patient should receive nighttime supplemental oxygen ,
particularly if he desaturates to less than 90%.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient is status post an MI , status
post PCI in 2004. His enzymes were negative on this admission
and a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. The patient was
restarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2
pump. The patient&apos;s ejection fraction was 45-50% with inferior
wall hypokinesis. Hypotension improved on admission , restarted
his beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the time
of discharge. Re the patient&apos;s history of a-fib , he was in
normal sinus rhythm for the majority of his hospital stay.
Coumadin was held peri-procedure when he was getting his PEG
placed and vitamin K had been administered in view of his
supratherapeutic Coumadin. His Coumadin should be restarted on
2/18/07. Of note as well for rhythm issues , the patient was
kept on potassium and magnesium scales while in hospital and he
has a partial pacemaker placed for his sick sinus syndrome.
4. GI: The patient had a history of constipation. His abdomen
was tympanitic when he first presented. He was given a bowel
regimen and has subsequently begun making good solid stool.
Midway through his hospital course , the patient developed trouble
with eating. He had multiple NG tubes placed which he was
self-discontinuing requiring urgent reconsideration of more
permanent feeding tubes. A discussion was held between our
service and the GI team , who felt that a PEG would be useful for
managing this patient&apos;s feeding in the future. On 10/1/06 , GI
endoscopically placed a PEG tube for future feeding. Nutrition
was consulted and tube feeds were re-initiated that evening.
Again , his Coumadin will be held until 9/14/07 so as to promote
appropriate wound healing around the site of the PEG placement.
5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did not
demonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. His INR on admission was
1.9. We had transiently restarted Coumadin but he will have to
restart that again on 9/14/07 , given the fact that it was held
for his PEG placement. He was continued on iron supplements
during his hospital stay.
6. Renal: The patient , as discussed above , has demonstrated a
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His creatinine was mildly elevated which is secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency for unclear reasons. His creatinine by the
time of discharge had improved dramatically to 0.7.
7. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s oral hypoglycemics were held during
this hospital stay. He was started on insulin sliding-scale and
Lantus. As his feeding has increased and his tube feeds have
reached goal , his Lantus has had to be titrated up. He is
currently at 15 units q. p.m. He may need more while at the
facility that he is going to.
8. GU: The patient has a history of vesiculous spermatocele or
hydrocele , which is going to be followed by urology as an
outpatient. We had held his Flomax initially given low blood
pressure but we restarted it during his hospital stay here.
9. FEN: As mentioned above , the patient is on aspiration
precautions secondary to speech and swallow evaluation that was
consistent with aspiration. NG tubes were placed multiple times
but were self-discontinued by the patient. Finally , a PEG tube
was placed on 3/2 and tube feeds were reinitiated that evening.
10: Psych: The patient has a history of being mildly agitated.
Zyprexa was initiated here at home doses of 2.5 mg q. day and
then titrated up to 2.5 mg b.i.d. The patient has responded very
nicely to this and is no longer agitated.
11. Prophylaxis: He was kept on TEDS and P-boots. Coumadin as
mentioned above will need to be restarted on 9/14/07 and Nexium
was to continue while he is here.
The patient is full code. His contacts include his son ( 755 ) 304-4394 and Hillesheim , his daughter ( 041 ) 769-5379.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: See addendum
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a temperature of 98.4 T
max , his current is 96.6. His heart rate is in the 90s. His
blood pressure has been stable in the 110-120s/70-80s. His
respirations have been 18-20 , satting 92-96% on room air. In
general , he is in no acute distress. His lungs are with coarse
bilateral breath sounds. His rate and rhythm were regular
without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and nontender with good
bowel sounds. His extremities are without edema.
He is to be discharged today , 2/27/06 , to rehabilitation where
they will focus primarily on his physical therapy and rehab
needs.

Discharge Date: 3/23/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. SINUSITIS.
2. STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman
status post cardiac transplant ( 11/27 )
who was transferred to the Nasstrict Hospital Of with a
history of hemoptysis.
The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a rather unremarkable
course except for the development of some graft CAD ( seen on last
catheterization ). The patient was admitted from 11/17/96 to
6/24/96 with a two month history of sputum production. The
patient was empirically started on IV cefotaxime and his
cyclosporine was adjusted up to 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient&apos;s
shortness of breath and respiratory problems subsequently resolved.
A CT of the chest showed prior granulomatous involvement of the
lung and spleen. The patient had AFB times three done: all
negative. The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in his
sputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen for
him. After the patient was discharged , the patient continued
continued to have persistent ear fullness and pain , and a thick ,
but clear , nasal discharge. Then , approximately one week ago , the
patient noted increasing cough. The patient denies any associated
fevers or chills. On the day prior to admission , the patient noted
his sputum was blood tinged. The patient subsequently coughed up
approximately one quarter cup of bright red blood , which was
apparently witnessed in the Emergency Room at the outside hospital.
The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount not
documented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has not
had any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ).
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in
1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ).
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Status post coronary
artery bypass graft. 4. Status post a left ventral hernia repair.
5. Status post a right ankle fracture. 6. Status post goring by
bull in 1987. 7. Liver laceration. 8. Hypertension. 9. Peripheral
vascular disease.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2.
Cardizem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Imuran
175 mg p.o. q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife in Jo The patient was a janitor until 1/19 The
patient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. The patient
drinks only socially ( occasionally ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 78.
Mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus ,
congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On vitals , temperature was 97.9 , blood
pressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 ,
respirations 20 , and O2 saturation 96% on two liters. The patient
is an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress.
HEENT examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were
equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
muscles were intact. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was
approximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese ,
nontender , and nondistended. Extremities had 2+ bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine
1.2. CBC revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit
35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. PT was 13 , PTT 28.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had no hemoptysis throughout his
Mo Hospital hospitalization.
The patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on
4/3/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of
the left lower lobe ( where the CT abnormalities were seen ).
Purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriate
cultures and tests. No evidence of malignancy was seen. The
Pulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriate
antimicrobial coverage for MAI. Therefore , the patient was started
on clarithromycin and ethambutol. Given that these medications
effect the liver cytochrome P450 system , the patient&apos;s cyclosporine dose
required adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels
200-300. The patient also underwent CT scan of his maxillofacial
area on 9/12/96. This scan revealed air levels in both maxillary
sinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. Subtotal opacification
was seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. Also , subtotal
opacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstrated
bilaterally. The frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; of
the few air cells present , there was complete opacification. The
overall impression was pain and sinus disease with left
otomastoiditis. The patient underwent further evaluation in the
ENT Clinic on 7/24/96 ; their recommendations included Biaxin times
four weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at least
four weeks for coverage of MAI ). The Infectious Disease team
recommends that the patient&apos;s repeat AFBs be followed up and , if
they are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could be
stopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. The
Pulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started on
Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonary
function tests obtained as an outpatient. It is also recommended
that the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at his
next Transplant Clinic visit ( LDL came back at 151 after patient&apos;s
discharge ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol
1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffs
q.i.d. , Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and Ocean
Spray two sprays n.a. q.day.
CONDITION: Fair.
DISPOSITION: To home , follow up appointment in the Transplant
Clinic on 8/26/96 ; the patient also instructed to
arrange a follow up appointment with Dr. Gullace ( Pulmonary ). The
patient should have cyclosporine levels monitored carefully ,
especially over the next week or two.

Discharge Date: 4/18/2001
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CEREBRAL INFARCTIONS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
4. SICK SINUS SYNDROME STATUS POST DDDR
PACEMAKER.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Briefly , this is an 80 year-old woman with
coronary history of hypertension , diabetes and
atrial fibrillation admitted to Friends Medical Center on the 12 of September for congestive heart failure and was at the time ,
diagnosed with receptive aphasia and a right hemianopsia. CT of
head was negative at that time and she was diagnosed with right MCA
stroke. She was started on anticoagulation as well as Lasix and
nitrites. Echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed an
ejection fraction of 40 to 45%. She was transferred to the Stie Dickhall Hospital on the 3 of November for further evaluation
here.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Sick sinus syndrome ,
complete heart block status post DDDR
pacemaker. 2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. DVT in 1992 ,
4. Right TKA , 5. Coronary artery disease , 6. CHF , 7.
Depression. 8. Diabetes. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Include quinidine , procainamide and disopyramide.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Heparin , Lasix , Insulin , Cozaar ,
Imdur , aspirin , Humulin and sotalol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for: She had a
temperature of 99.9 , blood
pressure of 108/54 , pulse of 78 , 95% on four liters. She is an
obese , elderly woman in no apparent distress. HEAD AND NECK: Exam
revealed oral mucosa was moist. Normocephalic , atraumatic. NECK:
Notable for JVD of 11 to 12 cm. , no bruits. LUNGS: Crackles 1/3
of the way up bilaterally. She had regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , benign. She had 1+
edema bilaterally; 1+ pulses. NEURO: Notable for alert and
oriented to time , place and person. Her language is notable for a
receptive aphasia. Her cranial nerves II through XII were intact
except for right hemianopsia. MOTOR: Gait was grossly normal.
Grip strength was 5/5 and symmetric. SENSORY: Grossly normal.
DTRs were 1+ and symmetric throughout. Toes were downgoing
bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Were noted before of BUN , creatinine of 26/0.8 ,
K of 2.4. LFTs were within normal limits.
Initial CK was 42. She had an LDL of 42 , HDL of 30. TSH was 1.89 ,
Troponin was 0.12. White count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 31 ,
platelets of 156. Her INR was 1.3 , PTT was 35.7 , urinalysis
revealed 40 to 50 white cells , 1+ bacteria and 2+ leukocyte
esterase. Her chest x-ray was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM: 1. Neuro: The patient was
likely to have a left MCA stroke
at the outside hospital. Repeat CT at Er/na Hospital
confirmed these findings. She was continued on anticoagulation
since it was felt that most likely the etiology of stroke was
cardioembolic given her cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Of
note , she remained stable until the evening of the 10 of June when she
was found to have depressed mental status and new left hemiparesis.
Repeated head CT was unchanged and she was felt to have a new right
MCA stroke again due to cardioembolic causes. At this time , the
family made a decision to make her DNR/DNI. She was continued on
aspirin and started on full heparinization. Her neurologic status
remained stable and she has improved slowly. Her swallowing
improved and over the next several days ate normally. She
continued to have a receptive aphasia although this improved and
she was able to repeat although her naming remained poor. Physical
therapy and speech were consulted and followed the patient. She
continues to do well. Follow-up CTs have remained unchanged. She
will undergo a SPECT examination to confirm this stroke but
otherwise she has been transitioned to Coumadin for long-term
anticoagulation.
2. Cardiovascular: She is felt to have , given her new depressed
ejection fraction and Troponin leak , she was felt to possibly have
coronary disease and she was expected to go to coronary angiography
given her progressive neurologic symptoms. This was deferred and
she will be continued on conservative therapy including aspirin and
anticoagulation. She was felt to be in some congestive heart
failure and has been diuresed gently with some improvement in her
oxygenation and cardiac exam. Her rhythm should remain at AV paced
without any services.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be referred to rehabilitation
center for further rehabilitation.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 81 mg p.o. q d , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.
d , NPH insulin 10 b.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q d , Betapace 80 mg

ATTENDING: PUSSER , ROLLAND M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest and left arm pain , and left arm paresthesias.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 47-year-old female with a past medical history , which
includes HIV positive , hepatitis C positive , seizures , and
neuropathy , who presented complaining of left hand paresthesias
followed by left hand pain that marches proximally up her left
arm and affecting her left shoulder and chest. Along with these
symptoms , she has associated shortness of breath , palpitations ,
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and nausea. The patient notes that
these symptoms have been occurring approximately five times per
week over the past two months. She has notified her PCP of these
events , however , the etiology has never been identified. Of
note , the patient states that these symptoms have increased in
frequency since having two syncopal events , which occurred three
days prior to admission.
Regarding syncope , the patient recalls her first loss of
consciousness episode occurring three days ago in her bedroom.
There were no antecedent symptoms. She came back to
consciousness while on the ground , called out for help and her
daughter came immediately. There was no witnessed seizure
activity , no postictal confusion , no tongue trauma nor was there
any incontinence. A second episode of syncope occurred two days
prior to arrival while the patient was standing in the bathroom.
There was some preceding lightheadedness this time. The
post-event characteristics were the same. Again , the patient was
found by her son when she called out for help.
The patient denies prior history of syncopal events , however , she
does have a lifelong history of seizures and has not been taking
her Keppra for approximately a year , as her prescription has ran
out and she has failed to keep follow-up appointments with her
primary neurologist , Dr. Loock Both the patient and her
daughter note that she usually has postictal confusion and that
these syncopal events did not fit that description. Furthermore ,
these episodes did not feel like her occasional hypoglycemic
episodes. Unfortunately , the patient&apos;s blood sugars were not
obtained during these syncopal events.
Of note , the patient recently started Flexeril to treat chronic
low back pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient admits stable three-pillow orthopnea , but new
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no lower extremity edema , weight
loss or increased abdominal girth. The patient has stable
four-block ambulation limited by dyspnea. She has had notable
weight loss as she has decreased in dress size from 18-14 over
the past nine months. She denies fevers or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
HIV positive , drug-seeking behavior , parotitis , migraine
headaches , anxiety and panic , depression , hepatitis C , seizures ,
neuropathy , pancreatitis , abnormal Pap smear , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral aneurysm , herpes simplex type 1 , and chronic low back
pain.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
Flexeril 5 mg daily , clonazepam 1 mg q.i.d. , Truvada one tablet

SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is from Reve Abilester She is living with her daughter
and son. No prior tobacco or smoking history. She has a prior
history of drinking alcohol and IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Negative for early coronary artery disease. Her father had an MI
at age 74. Her mother had coronary artery disease at age 76.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 172/80 , heart rate 82 ,
respiratory rate 20 , and saturating 100% on room air. This is a
middle-aged woman appearing older than stated age , complaining of
left hand pain , but otherwise appears comfortable. She has a
disconjugate gaze , has only light vision in her left eye.
Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx is benign. She had no oral
ulcers or thrush. Neck is supple , without cervical
lymphadenopathy , no JVD , and no carotid bruits. Lungs are clear
to auscultation. Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. Abdomen was obese , soft , nondistended , and
nontender with questionable splenic fullness , no clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema. She had a 4 x 4 ecchymosis on her left
shoulder and a 2 x 2 scab over her left elbow. The soft tissue
extending from the left shoulder to left elbow was tender to
palpation as was the left chest. She had decreased sensation of
bilateral lower extremities and left. Aside from a disconjugate
gaze , cranial nerves were intact. Motor exam was intact. Gait
was slightly wide-based , but sufficient without cane. Negative
Romberg , negative pronator drift , and no dysmetria on
finger-to-nose bilateral , and deep tendon reflexes were 2+
throughout.
ADMISSION LABORATORY VALUES:
Sodium 138 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 103 , CO2 28 , BUN 13 ,
creatinine 0.7 , glucose 179 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 1.6 , ALT 35 ,
AST 34 , alkaline phosphatase 57 , CK 51 , CK-MB 1.4 , troponin less
than assay , white count of 3.35 , hemoglobin 12.6 , hematocrit
36.7 , PT 14.4 , INR 1.1 , and PTT 29.5.
ADMISSION DATA:
Chest x-ray was within normal limits. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm without ischemic change. CAT scan of the head was within
normal limits. Left shoulder and arm plain films were negative
for fracture or dislocation.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 47-year-old female with a history significant for HIV ,
diabetes , questionable cerebral aneurysm , and seizure disorder
( not taking Keppra for the past year ) , who recently had two
syncopal events without prodrome and without postictal state
( thus unlikely a seizure in etiology ) , who presented for
evaluation of left arm paresthesias and chest pain , with
associated diaphoresis , shortness of breath and nausea , which has
been intermittently occurring over the past two months.
During this admission , the patient had frequent recurrences of
her left arm and chest pain symptoms , which were related to
syncopal events. Thus , the medical team does not think that
these two issues are related. The patient underwent an extensive
syncopal evaluation , however , the etiology was never identified.
The etiology of the patient&apos;s left arm and chest symptoms and
syndromes also was not identified during this admission , however ,
the medical team suspects it may be related to a cervical spinous
process , potentially arthritis , disc herniation or nerve root
impingement. Please see below for more details. The remainder
of the dictation will be divided into system:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient underwent an extensive
cardiovascular evaluation , all of which was negative.
a. Pump: Given the patient&apos;s history of HIV and taking
antiretroviral , there was a concern about associated
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram that was performed was completely
within normal limits. The patient did not exhibit signs of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea during this admission.
Dyspnea on exertion could be related to decondition.
b. Rhythm: The patient&apos;s telemetry history on 11/8/2006 was
notable for a nonsustained 5-beat run of wide complex tachycardia
with rates in the 150&apos;s. This was immediately followed by a
nonsustained 4-beat run of narrow complex tachycardia.
Cardiology consult was placed to review the telemetry strip and
to assess for referral to EP Service for potential AICD. Given
the negative echocardiogram , the Card Service wanted to rule out
ischemia-induced arrhythmia , so a MIBI was performed , and the
patient was started on low-dose beta-blocker and aspirin. The
adenosine MIBI was within normal limits. The telemetry strip was
reviewed by the EP Service and diagnosed the patient with
nonsustained SVT with aberrancy. The Card Service then advised
that there was no need for AICD. They stated that if tolerated ,
the beta-blocker could be continued and that the patient should
be set up as an outpatient for a loop recorder. This will be
coordinated through the patient&apos;s PCP. Of note , after starting
metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d. , the patient had occasional bradycardia to
the high 40&apos;s. Thus , it was determined that this medication
should be discontinued as it may be impairing the patient&apos;s
exercise tolerance.
c. Ischemia: Coronary disease risk factors include diabetes and
family history. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction , had
no ischemic change on her EKG , and had a negative MIBI. No
further workup for coronary artery disease was indicated. A
lipid panel was completely within normal limits and suggesting
treatment was not indicated.
d. Miscellaneous: On 6/10/2006 , the patient was evaluated for
one of her left arm and chest pain events. The patient was noted
to be diaphoretic and complained of nausea and shortness of
breath. The symptoms occurred while the patient was lying in
bed. Upon arrival by the team , her blood pressure was 90/56 ,
heart rate was 56 , she had poor pallor , was diaphoretic , and
described chest pain radiating up and down her arm. EKG in
telemetry during the event was normal sinus rhythm with any acute
ST or T-wave changes. The event spontaneously resolved in less
than 15 minutes without medical intervention.
2. Neuro: The patient has a history of convulsive seizures and
has been noncompliant with Keppra for the past 12 months because
she failed to keep neuro appointment with Dr. Sconiers and has
been unable to obtain refills. Per the patient , her recent
syncopal events were without prodrome and without postictal
state. Thus , were unlikely prior seizures and unlikely seizure
in focus. An EEG was performed during this admission and
demonstrated no definite focal or epileptiform features. Keppra
was restarted at 250 mg b.i.d. with a goal to increase to 500 mg
b.i.d. after 7 days and to 750 mg after another week. There was
a question of a history of cerebral aneurysm , diagnosed at an
outside facility , which was never confirmed by Tonfay Medical Center imaging. MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck
obtained this admission was negative for hemorrhage , mass , edema ,
hydrocephalus , infarction , and negative for abnormal enhancement.
There was no aneurysm high-flow AVM or stenosis found , and MRA
of the neck had no significant abnormality. The patient&apos;s
neurologist , Dr. Klez , was aware of this admission. A
follow-up appointment has been made.
3. Endocrine: History of diabetes type II , hemoglobin A1c of
6.1 , reflects excellent outpatient glycemic control , however , the
patient reports becoming diaphoretic with normal glycemic levels
between 80 and 100. Given recent weight loss without glyburide
dose adjustment , the medical team decreased glyburide to 2.5 mg
daily for the patient to begin upon discharge. During this
admission , the all oral agents were held and the patient was
treated with the Ryo Hospital Medical Center insulin protocol.
4. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of HIV
positive , CD4 count on 11/21/2006 was 217. The viral load was
less than assay. The patient continued on Truvada and Lexiva.
The patient complained of dysuria on 7/26/2006. Urinalysis was
ordered , but symptoms resolved before specimen could be sent the
lab.
5. Pain: History of chronic pain and lumbar spine herniations.
The methadone dose of 155 mg was confirmed with the outpatient
clinic. No additional regular narcotics were given during this
admission.
6. Heme: The patient has chronic pancytopenia. She has a
normocytic normochromic anemia with normal iron studies , B12 and
folate , and a low reticulocyte index consistent with anemia of
chronic disease , likely from HIV immunosuppression.
7. Miscellaneous: The patient was screened by the Physical
Therapy Service who recommended a home safety evaluation. This
will be coordinated to the Tlandgilb O Visiting Nurses Association.
Given the liability and predictability of events , the team
implemented a 24-hour urine collection to assess for
pheochromocytoma. The results of the studies are pending at the
time of this discharge. The patient may have autonomic
dysregulation as part of her diabetes. Alternatively , the
medical team speculates that the patient may have cervical spinal
arthritis , lumbar herniation or nerve root impingement
contributing to these symptoms. Of note , the patient states that
these episodes had occurred more frequently inpatient and they
were at home. It was until the day of discharge that it was
noted that the patient was not receiving her Klonopin 1 mg q.i.d.
as she had prior to admission. In fact , she has only received
three doses of Klonopin over a six-day period. It is unclear
what role anxiety is playing into these events. On the day of
discharge , the patient stated that she was making arrangements to
see an orthopedic specialist at Laly County Health for
evaluation of her cervical spine.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Syncope , not otherwise specified.
2. Left arm pain/left chest pain/left arm paresthesias ( not
otherwise specified ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Ecotrin 81 mg daily , clonazepam 1 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. , Imodium one
to two tablets q.i.d. p.r.n. for diarrhea , Truvada one tablet
p.o. daily , Lexiva 1400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily ,
Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for 14 doses and then 750 mg b.i.d.
indefinitely , methadone 155 mg daily , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. ,
Zoloft 300 mg daily , trazodone 100 mg at bedtime p.r.n. , and
Zofran 4 mg daily p.r.n. for nausea.
MEDICAL FOLLOW UP:
On 10/24/2006 , the patient is scheduled to see her PCP , Dr. Les Orosco On 10/21/2006 , she is scheduled to see her psychiatrist ,
Dr. Damien Scherzer On 4/8/2006 , she is scheduled to see
her Infectious Disease , Dr. Marion Callais On 7/6/2006 , she is
scheduled to see her neurologist , Dr. Shane Bemberry In
addition , the patient is going to be followed by the Na Riventtortonlis Jo VNA
who will do a medication reconciliation and home safety
evaluation.
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Take medications as listed , clarify discrepancies with your
PCP. This means stop taking Flexeril , ____ glyburide has been
changed to 2.5 mg , and low-dose aspirin has been started.
2. If you faint again , you should return to the ER for
evaluation.
3. If your chest pain symptoms recur and persist longer than the
typical course , call your PCP and/or return to the emergency
room.
4. Make an appointment with the Smill Memorial Hospital to evaluate
the cause of her left arm symptoms.
5. Check your blood sugars before meals and at bedtime , record
and bring your results to your follow-up appointment.
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PCP:
1. Please arrange for a loop monitor.
2. Follow up on a 24-hour urine studies assessing for
pheochromocytoma.
3. Adjust the patient&apos;s diabetes management as needed.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
59 year-old right-handed woman admitted for suspected acute stroke. Her
PMH includes HTN , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA vs. stroke 10/26
( manifest as slurred speech , left arm and leg weakness ). prior
myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , and history of left Bell&apos;s palsy x 3 with
chronic weakness of facial expression muscles on the left. She had a
possible patent foramen ovale with agitated saline contrast passage on
valsalva maneuver TTE when she was admitted 11/25 for stroke work-up.
Recently , this woman has had 2-weeks of general fatigue , exertional dys
pnea , frequent headaches , and intermittent blurred vision while driving
followed by a 2-3 second episode of binocular visual loss 4/13/03.
Notably , she ran out of amlodipine and reports obtaining a level of
240/150 on self-monitoring. One day prior to admission she saw her PCP
who noted hypertension and referred her to an ophthalmologist , who
obtained a normal exam by report.
She awoke this morning with a more severe right frontal headache with
pain radiating to the right shoulder. She also experienced a problem
with gait , leaning to the right. Her husband phoned EMS because she had
a severe headache and seemed &quot;confused.&quot; At present , the patient denies
headache and confusion , as well as diplopia , vertigo , dysphagia , and
dysarthria. She denies recent chest pain , but has had orthopnea.
PMHx: hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA versus stroke ,
prior myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent
left Bell&apos;s palsy , allergic rhinitis , chronic renal insufficiency
( baseline creatinine around 1.5 )
Meds: ASA 81 , HCTZ , atenolol , amlodipine , atorvastatin , loratadine , PRN
albuterol
All: iodinated contrast , losartan
VS: T 97.2 HR 57 BP 150/90
GEN obese woman , comfortable HEENT sclerae anicteric , oral mucosa moist
NECK: no bruits
HEART mild bradycardia , regular rhythm , II/VI SEM at USB ABD soft ,
nontender , nondistended EXT: no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema; radial
and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+
NEURO: MS significant for no deficits on orientation , attention , langua
ge , memory , and praxis. CN exam significant for right hypertropic skew ,
left facial droop , mostly lower face but with weak eyebrow raise as
well. Motor exam with normal tone , no pronator drift , strength 5/5 in
all muscle groups in upper and lower extremities. Coordination exam
with slightly slowed fine finger movements , right hand , normal
performance on finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin , sensory exam
without deficits in light touch , temperature , vibratory sensation ,
reflexes 2 throughout except for 1 in the ankles , toes downgoing
bilaterally. GAIT slightly wided based but stable gait with upright
posture , normal arm-swing. No difficulty with heel , or toe walk. Falls
to left on tandem gait.
Non-contrast head CT negative for evidence of stroke or hemorrhage.
Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recent
headaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inability
to walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. Neurologic exam was
significant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facial
weakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right fine
finger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait.
These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosis
was felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensive
encephalopathy. The patient had recent poorly-controlled
hypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure including
exertional dyspnea and orthopnea.
An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensive
encephalopathy. Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate the
procedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experience
as a prohibitive factor. Her atenolol was continued and she was placed
on aspirin 325 mg qd for stroke and heart prophylaxis. Her blood
pressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and she
remained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , and
weakness. Her fine finger movements with the right hand were improved
by hospital day 2. She continued to have difficulty with tandem gait ,
falling to the left. Her lipid profile revealed elevated total
cholesterol and LDL. Her homocysteine level was slightly elevated at
14. She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well as
supplement her diet with folic acid. She has an outpt appointment for
carotid non-invasive studies 10/25/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
The pt should take a full dose of aspirin ( 325 mg ). She should take
folate supplementation. She should also discuss raising her dose of
atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDL
were elevated this admission.

Discharge Date: 9/6/2002
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: LEFT HIP FRACTURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lumadue is a 68-year-old man who
came in with a chief complaint of hip
pain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in
4/17 for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.
At that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q wave
MI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressor
at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect in
the inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without any
peri-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%
in contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimately
discharged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressor
for unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , he
developed increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,
denied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright red
blood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,
the patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.
On the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanical
fall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had no
light-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea or
vomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior to
or after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side and
immediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which she
presented to the emergency room at Fentstraub Neycian&apos;s Medical Center .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy
( ischemic ) , peripheral vascular disease ,
status post amputation of right-sided toes , status post right
femoral to PT avascularization , diabetes type II , status post CVA ,
hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q.d. , multivitamins , cough medicine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack per
day x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.
He has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in Targtine Highway , Birm , Vermont 21711 , and is in the insurance business.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Father
died at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 of
a heart attack.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 ,
heart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 ,
oxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.
LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.
His left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site for
bypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left leg
was externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb
19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 ,
hematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinus
tach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals ,
no evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary
edema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture of
the left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lesser
trochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degrees
angulation. His femoral head was reduced.
IMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac history
and vascular disease , status post left hip fracture
with mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient was
to be admitted to the orthopedic service with
medicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patient
was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak although
CK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performed
which revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinus
tach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.
Sinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly with
element of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak was
attributed to strain particularly in the setting of his
tachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor and
continued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed with
afterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.
2. Pulmonary - The patient&apos;s crackles persisted on lung exam after
aggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT which
revealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularity
consistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component of
congestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. The
patient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and was
treated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygen
requirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on two
liters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.
3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the setting
of diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patient
subsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in his
creatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fat
emboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.
4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl and
levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed
6/18/02. The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count on
admission and discharge was 12.
5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mild
perfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndrome
and was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient&apos;s daughter.
6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.
for prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for six
months minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.
7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultures
were negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient was
maintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of his
anticoagulation.
8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemics
prior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. The
patient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which were
removed on 6/18/02. The patient was evaluated by plastic surgery
for his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended dry
sterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.
with DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,
with pressure sore prevention.
9. FEN - The patient was discharged on standing 20 mEq of K-Dur
q.d. It is likely to be checked q.o.d. to monitor for any further
requirements particularly in the setting of his runs of
nonsustained V-tach as noted above.
10. Ortho - The patient is followed daily by orthopedic surgery
and was discharged with staples on his left lower extremities to be
discontinued per orthopedic surgery recommendations in the future.
11. Disposition - The patient was stable for discharge to rehab on
7/28/02. He was to follow up with his primary care physician ,
orthopedic surgery , cardiology , and pulmonary medicine within the
next two weeks. His labs are to be drawn for a metabolic panel ,
magnesium and calcium q.o.d. for as long as the primary care
physician feels it is necessary with repletion of his electrolytes
as needed. He is to have physical therapy performed as needed.
His weightbearing status is non-weightbearing on the left lower
extremity and weightbearing as tolerated on his right lower
extremity per orthopedic surgery at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE DIET: ADA diet , low fat , low cholesterol , low salt.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hold for
systolic blood pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 55 ,

Discharge Date: 3/2/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS
SURGERY IN 1988.
2 ) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SINCE 1983.
3 ) INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man with
a history of ischemic heart disease
since 1983. He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this time
and in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and a
subsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. In 1991 , he
sustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantine
thallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. He was
well maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until September 1992.
At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstable
angina. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.
An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.
Persantine thallium in September 1995 demonstrated posterobasilar
defect with 60% redistribution. After this episode , he had again
been symptom free. On 9/13/95 , the patient began experiencing
substernal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left arm
with good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episode
time of five minutes. On 11/23/95 , he had a similar episode for
approximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. On the day of
admission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode of
substernal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.
EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. Patient was
heparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin and
nitrates. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and the
plan was to do a persantine thallium. The patient continued to
have pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the Caus Memorial Hospital for further evaluation and cardiac
catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for polio
with subsequent muscle weakness of the left
hip and leg.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mg
q.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , and
Heparin 1300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for a
blood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heart
rate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was no
jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs were
clear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point of
maximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. Abdomen was
soft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,
extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassium
of 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , and
cholesterol was noted to be 287.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. Mollema had one episode of 10/10
substernal chest pressure not associated with
diaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstrated
inversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversions
in III and F. These inversions were present on a 11/28/95 EKG but
not on a 6/25/95 EKG. The EKG changes with the past medical
history was most likely significant of ongoing instability of the
patient&apos;s anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. At this
time , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. This is a 57 year
old male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the
past status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988
admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.
Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.
Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vessel
disease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anterior
descending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramus
was occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graft
to the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to the
patient&apos;s pain and EKG changes. The patient was continued on
Heparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemed
appropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. The patient was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory on 1/11/95 for successful PTCA of the
ramus occlusion. Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chest
pain free. Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with a
blood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. The right femoral
catheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulses
were 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and there
was no cyanosis. The patient was enrolled on the AMH protocol as
per Dr. Androsky and as such , received 36 hours of intravenous
protocol therapy post-catheterization. The right groin sheaths
were removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,
and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint of
chest pain. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital
day. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of
130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,
O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normal
limits. Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity
non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs.
DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptom
free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. and
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Quincy Noble Aldo Zeyadeh at
Vere Hospital

ATTENDING: SEABROOKE , ODELL FORREST MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Non-ST elevation , acute
myocardial infarction , and acute renal failure. She was
transferred from the C A Hospital to the Ersullcy Medical Center
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old lady with
diabetes and known coronary artery disease status post CABG and
status post multiple PCIs. She was in her usual state of health
until three weeks ago when she began with classical paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She was taken to Ordland University Of Medical Center on
three different occasions in the past three weeks prior to
admission , where she was treated for pulmonary edema. Prior to
her admission to the I.marg Healthcare , she had had a
troponin leak of up to 3.6. This was on the 5 of July . She also was admitted with acute renal failure. Her
creatinine on the 15 of June per note was 1.1. When we
admitted her creatinine was 2.6. This was likely secondary to
the fact that she had received amikacin for urinary tract
infection at the Tawno Health and she had also had a
chest , abdominal , and pelvis contrast CT leading to contrast
nephropathy. When she was admitted , her main problems were the
following: She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
She was a high-risk patient with a TIMI score of 5. She had
acute renal failure probably secondary to a number of factors
including contrast dye what she had received at the outside
hospital and amikacin which she had received for urinary tract
infection. Her other problem was she had a urinary tract
infection per report secondary to E. Coli resistant to Levaquin
and gentamicin.
Her past medical history was relevant for the following:
She had diabetes type 2 with chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to the diabetes. She has anxiety disorder. She had
coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1992. She is status
post PCI with a stent placed in 2002 , and 2004 apparently. She
also had congestive heart failure with an EF per an echo
performed at Burg Man&apos;stard Memorial Hospital was 35%. She had GERD and
Barrett&apos;s esophagus. She had hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia. She had had a pacemaker placed. She had
hemorrhoids. She had osteoarthritis with both knees. She had
spinal stenosis and chronic back pain status post cholecystectomy
and a history of asthma.
Her allergies included the following: Bactrim , penicillin ,
erythromycin , Keflex , Metformin , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin.
Her social history , she was in a nursing facility. She is
divorced. She has four kinds. Lives in Gle and is often
visited by her children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 96 , her
pulse 77 , her blood pressure was 170/95 , although admittedly it
was difficult taking her blood pressure by auscultation. This
was measured by palpation and confirmed by Doppler. She was
satting 96% on 3.5 L via nasal cannula. She is alert and
oriented x3 in no acute distress. She had arcus senilis. Her
extraocular movements are intact. She had pupils equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Her chest showed bibasilar crackles/rales
two-thirds way up. Her JVP is 10 cm water. Her heart had a
regular rate and rhythm with no gallop. No rubs or murmurs
heard. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm with no
edema and she is grossly neurologically intact.
Her first set of labs at the Ha Ottejaquesrence Hospital
revealed the following: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 ,
CO2 24 , BUN 40 , creatinine 2.5 , glucose 95 , white blood cell
count of 10.16 , a hemoglobin of 10.0 , platelets 232 , INR 1.5.
Her BNP was 2138. Her lipase was 7. Her troponin level was
0.75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. On presentation ,
the patient had several EKG changes consistent with an acute
coronary syndrome. She was in normal sinus rhythm with T wave
flattening or inversion in leads V4 to V6 and in the inferior
leads also 2 , 3 , aVF. She had Q-S complexes in V1 through V3.
She was deemed to be a high-risk patient for the TIMI score of
5and they documented troponin leak. She was managed medically ,
not interventionally given her acute renal failure. She was
treated with unfractionated heparin with a PTT level of 50 to 70
seconds. She was given aspirin , Plavix. She was also given
eptifibatide intravenously for five days and is also treated with
beta blockers and ACE inhibitor. After five days , she had no
recurrent chest pain. Her EKG changes were persistent but her
troponin levels have trended downwards and she has really been
asymptomatic in this regard. Regarding her pulmonary edema , we
treated with Lasix initially 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and then on
standing PO Lasix 40 mg daily , and diuresed her and also gave her
morphine and oxygen. Within four or five days , her physical
examination was much better and her crackles and rales had
markedly decreased. On admission , she was saturating 96% on 3.5
L. She progressed. Her oxygen requirements decreased. She was
diuresed and was finally weaned off oxygen and is currently
saturating 97% on room air. The plan is for her to continue on
aspirin , Plavix , high-dose Lipitor , and beta-blocker , and
nitrates as needed.
2. In terms of her acute renal failure , based on the records
from the Trickvan Agi Health Network , her creatinine had jumped from
1.1 to 2.5 in three days. This was felt to be most likely due to
intrinsic renal failure. She did not have a low urine output and
she had received amikacin in the past few days prior to admission
as well as contrast dye and she did have a history of contrast
dye induced nephropathy leading to a predialysis state , although
she did not get dialysis on that occasion. Here , we simply
avoided nephrotoxic agents , were judicious in the use of Lasix
with strict ??____?? controls , and her creatinine gradually began
to decrease and today it is down to 1.6. Infectious Disease
wise , she came with the documented urinary tract infection
reported to be due to E. coli resistant to levofloxacin and
gentamicin. Here , we cultured her again and found E. coli more
than a 100 , 000 colonies , which was resistant to ampicillin ,
gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin. It was sensitive to
ceftazidime and she therefore received renally dosed ceftazidime
for her UTI to complete a 7 to 10-day course. Blood cultures
drawn on the 24 of April showed no growth to date. The
patient has also been afebrile in with a white blood cell count
between 7 and 11 , 000. In terms of her hypertension , of note , it
has been difficult to measure her blood pressure , probably
measuring her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation is a
most reliable way to do this. She was treated here with
hydralazine , Lopressor , and diuretics. On discharge , she feels
well. Today , she told me that she has not filled this for a long
time. She had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.
She is afebrile with a temperature of 98. Her pulse ranges
between 60 and 70. Her blood pressure is between 102 and 150
systolic and she is satting 95% on room air. Her current weight
is 73 kg and she is deemed to be euvolemic so this should be her
target weight and she is ambulating with assistance. She is
alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. She has got pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light. She has only a few
bibasilar crackles on bases. Otherwise , her lungs are clear.
Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no gallops , rubs , or
murmurs. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm. Her
right calf is quite tender to palpation. She has a documented
old DVT in her gastrocnemius vein. This is old and she has
probably got some postphlebitic syndrome and should be followed.
She is neurologically grossly intact.
Her laboratories at discharge include the following:
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , her creatinine is 1.6 , BUN is 50 , her
white blood cell count is 11.01 , hematocrit 28.5 , hemoglobin 9.2 ,
and platelets 258 with an INR of 1.2.
Her medications at discharge include the following:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg orally daily.
2. Ceftazidime 1 g IV q.24h. until August to complete a
7-day course.
3. Colace 100 mg orally twice a day in case of constipation.
4. Lasix 40 mg orally every 12 hours.
5. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day , while
the patient is bedridden.
6. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg orally three times a day.
7. Lopressor 37.5 mg orally three times a day with hold
parameters , hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 110 , or
a heart rate is less than 55.
8. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.
9. Vicodin one tablet every six hours in case of pain.
10. Risperidone 0.5 mg orally once a day.
11. Lipitor 80 mg orally once a day.
12. Plavix 75 mg orally once a day.
13. Celexa 20 mg orally once a day.
14. Esomeprazole 20 mg orally once a day.
15. Lantus 17 units subcutaneously every morning.
16. Novolog sliding scale.
DISPOSITION AND PLAN: The patient is to go to rehabilitation.
Things to do specifically include the following:
She should be diuresed with Lasix as needed to achieve a dry
weight goal of 72 kg. She should continue on ceftazidime for her
urinary tract infection until August and her calf pain -
DVT should be followed , one possibly to raise the Clevewill Ent Hospital as this may represent in a cold malignancy , for which she
may need to be worked up once the acute setting is over.
Studies performed at this hospital include the following:
A renal ultrasound as part of her workup for acute renal failure
reveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical cortical
cyst , left kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis. The patient
also had a MIBI , SPECT of her heart , which revealed the
following:
The combined ??____?? ischemia plus scar during the stress were
moderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9. Her rest LV
ejection fraction was 50%. The patient&apos;s PET CT test results
were normal and consistent with a small region of myocardial
ischemia in the septal area and also a focus of ischemia in the
OM territory. She had abnormal global LV systolic function and
these results demonstrated in interval progressing per her prior
study performed on November , 2004.

Discharge Date:
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: PNEUMONIA , RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
( MI ).
CHIEF COMPLAINT: CHEST PAIN AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male
with a history of hypertension , LVH ,
and heroin use , who presented with shortness of breath times
several weeks which was sometimes associated with chest pain. The
patient noted that the shortness of breath was often brought on by
heroin use ( He has not used cocaine for several years. His last
heroin use was the day prior to admission. ). His shortness of
breath was &quot;off and on , &quot; worse with exertion. It was not
necessarily worse when lying flat. He has had this shortness of
breath for several months , although as mentioned , was worse in the
weeks prior to admission. His chest pain was hard for him to
describe , although , he did mention that it was not heavy in
character. He admitted to some chest discomfort when he became
excited or agitated. He also described his chest pain as sharp.
There was no nausea. He did complain of some dizziness. His pain
did not radiate to the neck or arms and was different from
heartburn pain. Of note , the patient has not taken his outpatient
medications for the last six months and admits to diet
noncompliance with salty foods. The patient&apos;s last heroin use , as
mentioned , was the day prior to admission. In the past , he has
noticed that he cannot go more than two days without symptoms of
withdrawal.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for constipation for which he takes
laxatives. There is no abdominal pain.
Occasional headache. No change in vision. No dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Remarkable for IV drug abuse - heroin
currently , cocaine in the past.
2. Hypertension times many years. 3. Gout. 4. Left ventricular
hypertrophy.
MEDICATIONS: The patient has taken no medications for six months.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Ver La A with his
brother and his sister. He is on disability since
1992. He smokes one pack every 3 days. He rarely uses alcohol.
He does use IV drugs as mentioned.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.3 , heart rate 95. Upon
presentation to the emergency room , his
blood pressure was 190/110 , respiratory rate 24 , O2 sat 100% on two
liters. GENERAL: The patient was seated and in no acute distress.
HEENT: Conjunctiva was slightly pink but nonicteric. Extraocular
muscles are intact. Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to
light. He had poor dentition. His JVP was 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation on the left. On the right there were some crackles
midway up the lung field. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with a
normal S1 , S2. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Markedly hypoactive bowel sounds. His belly was soft and
obese , nontender. There were no obvious masses. EXTREMITIES: The
patient had 2+ pulses. There was no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
NEUROLOGIC: The patient was alert and oriented x 3. Neural exam
was otherwise nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride
106 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine
2.1 , glucose 107 , calcium 8.4. CK was 158 with an MB of 2.2 ,
troponin was 0.12. Toxicology screen was negative. Urine
toxicology was positive for opiates. Urinalysis was remarkable for
1+ blood and 3+ protein. CBC white count was 6.9 , hematocrit 45.7 ,
platelets 301 , 000. PT was 13.2 , PTT 32.6 , INR 1.0.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a right pleural effusion and a
right middle lobe pneumonia. EKG on arrival to the emergency room
showed an irregular ventricular rate at 156 which was likely atrial
fibrillation vs flutter. There was a normal axis. There were
T wave inversions in the inferior leads as well as V5 and V6. The
EKG was then repeated after the patient had received diltiazem
which showed sinus rhythm at 86. There were still T wave
inversions in AVL and V6. There was borderline first-degree AV
block. There was LVH and T waves were flat inferiorly.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular - ischemia. The
patient ruled out for MI by CKs but
had a troponin which peaked at 0.12. This was thought to be rate
related. Blood pressure control was established with verapamil
( The patient had severe bronchospasms to Lopressor and it was
unclear whether it was cardiac asthma or real bronchospastic
reaction. ) , clonidine , and losartan. ( The patient had cough and
desaturation to captopril. ) Aspirin was given. A lipid panel was
checked and showed a total cholesterol of 188 , LDL 130 , HDL 56 and
triglycerides of 63. The patient was initially continued on
simvastatin. Because of the worry of CHF , ( History of low EF ,
possible orthopnea ) an echocardiogram was performed which showed
LVEF only 25% with global hypokinesis and inferior/posterior
akinesis. The etiology of his heart failure was unclear as he had
never had a known myocardial infarction in the past. A chemical
stress test was performed on June , 2003 , and showed no
reversible defect but a large inferior scar. The patient was
subsequently taken to cardiac catheterization to determine whether
he had coronary artery disease. There was no coronary artery
disease on left heart cath. Right heart cath showed an elevated
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure close to 30 and a central venous
pressure of 18. His cardiomyopathy was not shown to be ischemic in
origin. There was no indication seen for AICD placement. However ,
for the elevated central pressures , the patient was aggressively
diuresed with IV Lasix which was then changed to p.o. torsemide.
Aspirin and simvastatin were discontinued given lack of coronary
artery disease for the sake of simplifying his medical regimen in
order to optimize the chance of medical compliance.
2. Pulmonary. The patient was given levofloxacin for
community-acquired pneumonia and improved. On the evening of
admission , he had a severe bronchospastic reaction to Lopressor so
this was discontinued. He received nebulizers around the clock for
recurrent wheeze and cough. It was noted that the onset of his
cough was after his captopril dosing. For this reason , captopril
was discontinued and changed to losartan which he tolerated well
and with resolution of his cough.
3. Renal. The patient&apos;s creatinine was noted to be up to the
mid-2s from a baseline in the mid-1s. Potential etiologies on
admission where thought to be hypertension , gout , heroin use or a
low flow during his cardiac arrhythmia on presentation. A phenol
was calculated and was shown to be less than 1%. A 24-hour protein
was performed and showed over 3 gm of protein. The most likely
cause of this proteinuria was thought to be CHF , although , the
patient should have renal follow up. The patient refused Mucomyst
in anticipation of his cardiac catheterization. He underwent a
renal ultrasound which showed increased echogenicity of both
kidneys which was consistent with medical renal disease. There was
no hydronephrosis seen. There were bilateral renal cysts and a
right renal calculus. The patient will be seen in follow up with
Dr. Doles of renal.
4. Heroin addiction. The LCMC team was consulted for heroin
addiction. Methadone was given and was tapered to off during his
admission.
5. Other. Allopurinol was given for his history of gout.
6. Prophylaxis. The patient was kept on subcu heparin.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Boddorf , his primary care
doctor , on Tuesday , August , 2003 , at 8:00 AM and with
Dr. Dunegan of renal on August , 2003 , at 1:30 PM.

Discharge Date: 10/27/1996
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INAPPROPRIATE SINUS PAUSE , ADMITTED FOR
PACEMAKER PLACEMENT.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) STATUS POST PTCA OF RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY
( TIMES TWO ) IN 1992.
3 ) STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1992.
4 ) STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT
TIMES TWO VESSELS IN 1992.
5 ) PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE , LEFT GREATER
THAN RIGHT CLAUDICATION.
6 ) DEPRESSION.
7 ) STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY.
8 ) STATUS POST PELVIC FLOOR SUSPENSION TIMES
TWO ( RECTOCELE AND CYSTOCELE ).
9 ) STATUS POST APPENDECTOMY.
10 ) HISTORY OF BOWEL OBSTRUCTION ( STATUS POST
PELVIC SURGERY WITH ADHESIONS ) TREATED
WITH LYSIS OF ADHESIONS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 61 year old female with
coronary artery disease ( status post
PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who
presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of
inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker
placement. Ms. Debrecht &apos;s pertinent medical history was significant
for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery
disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional
chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance
test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at
six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and
maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST
depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 6/9
revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right
coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right
collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20%
residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then
re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 6/9 revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with
prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen.
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Nethery ). Since
then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting
approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to
experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the
sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and
diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never
actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she
frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis.
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but
did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only
when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The
patient&apos;s anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was
discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiple
pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting
4.2 seconds. The patient was then sent to the Sa Ratee for further evaluation and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As described in Secondary Diagnoses above.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smoker
of one pack per day times thirty years quitting
eleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time of
divorce. Her primary medical doctor was Dr. Armand Shackelford
( Huban ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76
and history of hypercholesterolemia , mother died
at age 86 of gastrointestinal ulceration and had a history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and sister with non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcers.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. ( discontinued three weeks ago ) ,
vitamin supplements ( vitamin E , lysine , Co-Q10 , vitamin C , calcium ,
Centrum Silver , and primrose oil ) , and no over-the-counter
medications.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , Zantac , and Comtrex , all of which produce
angioedema and tetracycline ( sun sensitivity ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a blood pressure of
160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 ,
respirations 16 , and 97% on room air. GENERAL: Energetic white
female in no apparent distress. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynx
without erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. NECK: Supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally without
bruits. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with no
rubs , gallops , or murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and
percussion. ABDOMEN: Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tube
scars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) ,
normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , no
hepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distal
pulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity.
NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves
II-XII intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes
3+ bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of
3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liver
function tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled
7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. PT was 12.3
( 1.1 ) and PTT equalled 30.4. Chest x-ray showed status post
coronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acute
air space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 with
an axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright in
V4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheral
vascular disease and coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted for
evaluation and management of near syncope. Holter monitor had
demonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation of
beta blocker ( metoprolol ). The patient was admitted for
observation over the weekend. She experienced multiple sinus
pauses , particularly at nighttime. The longest pause recorded was
4.7 seconds. Though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm ,
she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamic
instability. She was enrolled in the ECTH trial and underwent
placement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the VVIR mode on
9/10/96. She tolerated the procedure without complication. Post-operative
chest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads and
no evidence of pneumothorax. Interrogation of the pacemaker
revealed appropriate response. The patient did well overnight and
was discharged on May , 1996 with instructions to follow-up
with Dr. Passarella in ten days.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged on May , 1996 in good
condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet one to
two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
FOLLOW-UP: She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Lafranca on
August , 1996 at 1 p.m.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Resume all your normal home medications at the doses you were taking.
2. Your new medication is lasix , which helps remove excess fluid from the
body. Have your blood chemistries checked ( potassium , magnesium )
3. Make an appointment to see Dr. Madina within one week.
4. Ask Dr. Slappy to check your EKG on dofetilide to make sure that your
&quot;QTc&quot; ( heart function ) is not long due to metformin + dofetilide
5. Your sugars have been mildly elevated ( 190s ). Have your sugars
checked as meds adjusted as an outpt
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. follow up ECHO - Dr. Toner will compare in-patient ECHO and priors
to determine interval change in valve function , ?when to undergo repair
vs. replacement
2. optimize medical regimen for management of mitral regurgitation ,
lasix + consider hydral + nitrates for afterload reduction ( pt was
told she had ?&apos;lupus like&apos; symptoms on lisinopril ). ACE-I would be
best if she can tolerate this

Discharge Date: 8/21/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
had a two vessel coronary artery
bypass graft on 3/10/97. She was discharged to home on 5/4/97 to
Diand Leb Hospital Hospital And Hospital where she developed
epigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and was
transferred back to Landso Souwalt Medical Center .
Her cardiac history dates back to October of 1995 when she was
admitted to Kassi Rehabilitation Hospital for an asthma flare. At that
time she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were
negative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to go
eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads
2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorly
and she was managed medically at that time.
In February of 1996 she was again admitted to Lita Hospital with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumed
gastroesophageal reflux disease. In September of 1996 an exercise
Thallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocol
with a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECG
changes. She stopped secondary to chest pain.
From 3/30/97 through 3/5/97 she presented with chest pressure at
rest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation she
was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that time
showed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated with
Lopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain.
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 with
an MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamil
secondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed
an left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesion
with collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90%
stenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventricle
with ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. She
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Following
catheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypass
graft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogen
therapy since she is a Jehovah&apos;s Witness. She was discharged in
sinus rhythm.
She returned on 10/17/97 and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardial
infarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MB
fraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with
Verapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multiple
episodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinus
rhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on 5/4/97 in normal
sinus rhythm.
Her postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distress
with epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , and
constipation. On 5/4/97 at rehabilitation the patient noted
worsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. This
was relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep with
epigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations.
ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 and
she was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevations
of 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to Yacull Hospital for further evaluation. She had no complaint of shortness
of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , syncope , or
presyncope. At Vero Medical Center she was noted to have
epigastric burning similar to a prior episode and was treated with
Maalox with relief.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was lying in bed in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx benign.
Neck: Supple. Full range of motion. No lymphadenopathy.
Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP 8 cm. Heart: No heave and no
thrill. Regular rate. S1 , split S2. 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.
Positive for frictional rub. Lungs clear to auscultation. No
wheeze or rhonchi. Chest had midline sternotomy without any
exudate or erythema. Sternum was stable. Back: No costovertebral
angle tenderness. Abdomen: Keloid in right upper quadrant. Soft ,
nontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II - XII intact. Intact sensation and
strength throughout. Reflexes symmetric and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 129 , potassium 5.4 , creatinine 1.0 , BUN
20 , glucose 227. Digoxin level 2.6. Hematocrit
45.1 , WBC 9.2. Her triponin-1 level was 0.7. ECG at Aifield Sum Taning Healthcare Center was in normal sinus rhythm. Normal left axis ,
normal intervals. 0.16 , 0.88 , 0.36. Rate of 85. Left atrial
enlargement. 1 mm ST depressions in 1 and 2 which is consistent
with Digoxin effect. 1 mm upsloping ST elevations in 2 , 3 , and F
unchanged from prior ECG on 8/28/97. Chest x-ray showed mediastinal
shadow. Stable with question of atelectasis at left base.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and her chest burning was primarily due to
gastrointestinal reflux which was relieved with Maalox , as well as
chest discomfort in her left shoulder which was due to
musculoskeletal pain and was relieved with Tylenol and Percocet or
Darvocet. On monitor she showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation
although she did have supraventricular tachycardia and one incident
of a ten-beat run. In light of the fact that the patient is a
Jehovah&apos;s Witness and is not a candidate for being Coumadinized for
episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation , it was felt that we would
use the anti-arrhythmic agent , Propafenone , to prevent episodes in
the perioperative period of atrial fibrillation. Her Digoxin was
discontinued and she tolerated Propafenone load of 150 mg t.i.d.
well along with her Verapamil dose.
Other issues during this admission were that her blood sugar was
high requiring sliding scale of insulin. Also the patient had
hyponatremia with sodium in the high 120s and low 130s throughout
her stay , as well as a potassium which was mildly elevated , ranging
from 5.0 to 5.8. Cortisol levels were drawn and results are
pending for possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The question of
a renal tubular acidosis type IV was raised.
Throughout the admission her chest burning was well controlled with
Maalox. Her Pepcid dose was increased to 20 mg b.i.d.
Helicobacter pylori and IgG antibodies were sent and results are
pending. Her musculoskeletal pain which is primarily in her left
shoulder radiating to her arm has been well controlled with
Tylenol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary history as above ,
asthma which has required hospitalization in
the past but no intubations , adult-onset diabetes mellitus for
which she takes Micronase , hypertension , gastroesophageal reflux
disease , hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy , left
lower lobe granuloma followed by chest CT scan , and cataracts.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4h , Albuterol inhaler
2 puffs q.i.d. , Ecasa 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Beclovent 2 sprays t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Epogen 10 , 000
units subcu three times a week , Gliburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Mevacor
20 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil SR 120 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: Beta blockers and Lisinopril. It is questionable
whether she has allergy to Naprosyn as well.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives at home with her daughter. No alcohol.
No tobacco.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to On Medical Center She will likely require a
short course of physical therapy and rehabilitation and will be
returning to home following her course of rehabilitation.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow-up in the future with her primary care
physician , Dr. Ruacho , as well as with her cardiologist , Dr.
Ciccarello CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is stable on the day
of discharge.

Discharge Date: 10/17/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCT.
CONTRIBUTING DIAGNOSIS: HYPERTENSION , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ,
DIABETES , SCHIZOPHRENIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old black
female with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , SVT and schizophrenia
presented with 45 minutes of substernal burning , shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. The patient has a long history of chest
pain which began in 1988 with her first rule out for MI. She has
had extensive cardiac workup including a recent ETT MIBI during
which she went 5 minutes 40 seconds with a maximum heart rate of
71 , blood pressure of 138/68 with no ST segment changes and no
evidence for ischemia. MIBI images: anteroapical defect on stress
images with reperfusion at rest consistent with ischemia. These
studies were done in October of 1992. The patient was thought to have
rate related ischemia which is induced by SVTs or other
precipitants that increase her heart rate. The patient has had no
substernal chest pressures since October of 1992. She experiences no
chest discomfort on exertion. She has had a good rate control on
Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient presented in the Emergency
Room today complaining of epigastric burning in her chest 1 time a
week which awakened her from sleep at night. It is usually relieved
by Mylanta. On the day of admission , however , the patient
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest burning without
radiation while lying in bed. She had eaten 1 hour before going to
bed. The pain was accompanied by palpitations , shortness of breath
and diaphoresis. She denied nausea and vomiting. It was not
relieved by Mylanta. The patient received a sublingual
nitroglycerin in the ambulance resulting in relief. The patient&apos;s
cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , history of
tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As
above: Adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a left great
toe ingrown toe nail , diverticulosis , history of frequent nose
bleed , multiple right pinna ear infection , schizophrenia , history
of colonic polyps with guaiac positive stools in 1987 and a barium
enema the same year demonstrating colonic diverticula , degenerative
joint disease of the knees. MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission:
Verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d , Naprosyn 375mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. ,
fluphenazine 35cc IM q 2 weeks , Ibuprofen 400mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Nitropatch , Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 45 units
q.a.m. , Pepcid 20mg b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 1 tablet p.o. q
d , Librium 10mg p.o. b.i.d. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known
drug allergies. Family history includes a brother who died at 60 of
an MI , a sister who died at 71 of an MI. Social History: The
patient is a widow with 4 children , lives with grandson , a retired
factory seamstress who stopped smoking 25 years ago. She had smoked
a 1/2 pack a day for 5 years and has no history of ethanol usage.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant black female in no
apparent distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
pulse of 100 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations at 16. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Oropharynx was clear.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. Heart: Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with distant heart sounds and normal S1 , S2. Abdomen:
Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese and
non-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. EXTREMITIES:
Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. The left great
toe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrown
toenail. Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. NEURO: Neuro exam
was grossly non-focal. Skin had no new rashes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 ,
a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarb
of 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. CK was 430
with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known to
have chronically elevated CKs. White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of
36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. PT 13 , PTT 30. LFTs
were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at
95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21
with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray was
without infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruled
out for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of
1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8.
There were no further EKG changes. The patient had no chest pain
while in the hospital. The patient&apos;s Lopressor was increased to
75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent a
diagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: An
LAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosis
and OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with a
proximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normal
ventricular function. The patient was offered PTCA of her critical
lesions and the patient declined. As the patient had not been
compliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would send
her out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her level
of chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date.
The patient&apos;s toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had ,
in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of the
margin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o.
q.i.d. The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiac
positive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested that
the patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. The patient had
anemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. Iron
studies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 ,
total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 ,
and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which was
thought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. These medications
were held while she was in house and her platelet level remained
approximately 100 and was so upon discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen for
schizophrenia and was discharged in stable condition
on the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin
325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub q
q.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d ,
Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1
tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. The patient
will have home health aid and VNA services to ensure more
compliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check finger
stick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and to
administer her Prolixin every week. The patient is recommended to
be on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr.
in the CO Clinic.

Discharge Date: 11/2/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Trudell is a 69 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in
January 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which
showed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%
left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary
artery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.
She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an
ejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to be
managed conservatively , and was medically managed for the following
year. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge
and one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes
with less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. The
patient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.
on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with
substernal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin with
relief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with
nausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with
resolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergency
department free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed
changes consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient was
admitted with unstable angina for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,
sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril
5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen
saturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. There was no
evidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no
bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was
present. Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with
normal bowel sounds present. Extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient&apos;s initial CK was 111.
Her second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of
45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK
of 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction
of 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. SMA seven was normal.
Troponin I was 0.0 on admission. White blood count of 11 ,
hematocrit 39.7. Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate
or any congestive heart failure evidence. Electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment
elevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST
segment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new
compared to a previous electrocardiogram from January 1996.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time
she was pain free and her electrocardiogram
abnormalities had resolved. Her heart rate and blood pressure were
controlled with intravenous medications and she was managed
medically until hospital day three when she was taken of the
cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac catheterization
revealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal
to D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex
lesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery
lesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and
septal HK and AK. The patient returned to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting
of her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro
infusion. From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit
throughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of
her chest pain. Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline.
Electrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250
mg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril

in bed in no apparent distress. Her temperature was 98.4 , pulse
106 , blood pressure 150/70 , respiratory rate 20 , saturation 95% on
room air. HEENT: Surgical right pupil , anicteric sclera , no nasal
discharge , moist oropharynx. Neck: Supple. No jugular venous
distention and no lymphadenopathy , full range of motion. Lungs:
Diffusely rigorous , no crackles or wheezes bilaterally.

non-tender , non-distended and no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities:
No edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurological:
Mild decreased sensation left side of face , otherwise cranial
nerves III-XII are grossly intact. Reflexes in upper extremities
were 1 plus , no reflexes elicited in lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.3 , hematocrit 43 ,
platelet count 312. BUN 20 , creatinine 1.4 ,
glucose 377 , LDH 220. Sputum revealed 4+ polys , 4+ epithelial
cells , gram negative and gram positive cocci. Chest x-ray revealed
no evidence of congestive heart failure and no infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 69 year-old woman with a history of
congestive heart failure and hypertension who
presented with a productive cough which was worsening over the past
3-4 days and fever to 101 with chills and shakes and increasing
shortness of breath. She was afebrile however at the time of
admission. Her exam was remarkable for diffuse rhonchi and
moderate jugular venous distention. She had a white blood cell
count of 9.3 with 54% polys and 9.6 % eosinophils. Blood glucose
of 377 and a chest x-ray without evidence of congestive heart
failure or infiltrate. She was treated in the emergency room with
Albuterol nebulizer and plans were to discharge her to home ,
however , her saturations dropped to 89% on room air with exercise
in the emergency room and was admitted for further observation.
She was started on intravenous Cefuroxime , and initially improved
with decrease in cough and shortness of breath however , the patient
continued to desat with exercise. A repeat chest x-ray was
performed which showed no change when compared to the admission
film. Her sputum culture grew out Pen-sensitive E-coli and she was
continued on her intravenous and then PO antibiotics. She
continued to desat with exercise , however , and her cough persisted
although she remained afebrile with a slightly elevated white count
and moderate peripheral eosinophilia. Her chest exam remained
rancorous and the reason for this remained unclear. Given the
finding of E-coli in the sputum sample , in addition to the elevated
eosinophilia and lack of finding on chest x-ray despite significant
findings on chest exam , the possibility of a worm or parasitic
disease was raised. The patient is from Pa but had not been
there in 8 years. She did have a history of diarrhea for several
weeks a few months prior to this admission. Stool specimen was
sent but was rejected by the laboratory and the patient was unable
to produce another stool specimen before discharge. The patient
was discharged to home with Albuterol inhaler and instructions to
follow up with her primary physician. In addition , plans were made
for her to have PFTs done as an outpatient and plan for chest CT if
her symptoms continued without other etiology being discovered.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po
q day. 2 ) Cefuroxime 500 mg PO b.i.d.
3 ) Premarin 0.625 mg PO q day. 4 ) Lasix 40 mg PO q day. 5 )
Tofranil 75 mg PO q HS. 6 ) Zestril 20 mg PO b.i.d. 7 ) Verapamil

q p.m. subcue. 9 ) Potassium slow release 10 mEq PO q day. 10 )
Albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d.
DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient&apos;s saturation was
92 to 93% on room air and dropping slightly to 90 to
91% with exercise , however she was tolerating this well and was
getting relief from her Albuterol inhaler. She was to finish a
full ten day course of antibiotics for presumed bronchitis and to
follow up with her primary physician in clinic for further
evaluation including PFTs and possible chest CT if symptoms did not
abate.

ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 108 , CO2 23 ,
anion gap of 9 , calcium 9 , magnesium 1.8 , total bilirubin 0.7 ,
BNP 165 , cardiac enzymes were not elevated , white count 6.91 ,
hematocrit 35.9 , platelets 227. Urinalysis was within normal
limits. PT 12.1 , PTT 43.2 , INR 1.0. A portable chest x-ray was
without any evidence of acute pulmonary process. EKG with sinus
bradycardia with rate of 55 with T-wave inversions in leads V5
and V6 , leads 1 , 2 and AVF. All present on prior EKG. There
were no acute ST changes.
EMERGENCY ROOM COURSE: Systolic blood pressure was in 190s. She
received aspirin x1 , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. x1 , Lopressor 5 mg IV
x1 , and blood pressure went down to 170s prior to her transfer to
the floor.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes.
Her EKG was abnormal , but unchanged from 1/28 She continued on aspirin ,
Plavix and
Lipitor. Fasting lipids did not indicate need for change in
statin treatment. On 3/1 , the patient had a recurrence of
her chest pain symptoms in the setting of her only hypertensive
event during this admission. Her EKG was notable for new flipped
Ts in leads V3 and V4 ( which happened to be seen previously
during this admission when she had atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response on 6/3 ). The medical team suspects
hypertensive-induced microvascular angina. A repeat rule out MI
has been re-initiated and is currently in progress at the time of
this dictation. A&amp;B set enzymes were negative.
Pump: Echocardiogram at the Dallnorm Community Hospital on 10/6
revealed normal left ventricle with an EF of 60% , left atrial
enlargement , 1-2+ mitral valve regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation , and mild pulmonary hypertension ( with pulmonary
artery pressure of 43 ). The patient had fine rales on her admit
exam with BNP of 160. Of note , on 10/6 at Warden Memorial Hospital the
patient had her Lisinopril increased to 15 mg b.i.d. to facilitate
better blood pressure control. ACE inhibitor and Lasix were held
during this admission due to arise in her creatinine. Lisinopril was
restarted at a dose reduction of 5 mg b.i.d. and Lasix was restarted
on 3/1 in the setting of symptomatic chest pain which began while the
patient was receiving a second unit of blood ( see heme below of more
details ). Her BNP following the transfusion was 265. The current plan
is to titrate ACE inhibitor to affect as long as her creatinine
does not climb.
Rhythm: The patient had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia with rates ranging
45-58 until 5/3 when she had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response
to 130s to 140s. She was effectively treated with
Lopressor 25mg x1 , 5 mg IV x2 , then diltiazem 10 mg x1. The patient later
then converted to sinus rhythm , sinus bradycardia. On 6/8 , the
patient had a 12-22 symptomatic ventricular pause. The consulting
cardiologist ( Dr. Siebel ) was notified of the atrial
fibrillation and ventricular pause event. Dr. Pinet
recommended starting an amiodarone load which has been
implemented and is currently in progress. He recommended no
inpatient EP eval this admission because the patient had no
further symptomatic pauses. Dr. Selma deferring decision and
arrangements for Holter versus loop monitors to the patient&apos;s
outpatient cardiologist Dr. Baldrige
According to the prior cardiac cath reports , the patient should
be on lifelong Plavix. It is Dr. Stayrook &apos;s preference for
the patient to be started on thromboembolic prophylatic Coumadin
( in the setting of paroxysmals of atrial fibrillation ) and to
discontinue the aspirin because of possible bleeding risk on
combination aspirin , Plavix and Coumadin. However , he is
deferring this decision to be made by the patient&apos;s outpatient
cardiologist.
Blood Pressure: The cardiologist consultation Dr.
Miehe felt that the chest pain and hypertension symptoms could
be consistent with recurrence of renal artery stenosis. On
10/27/07 , a Doppler renal ultrasound was notable for significant
re-stenosis of the left renal artery. The patient an
angioplasty and stent was placed without peri-procedure
complication aside from the possibility of small blood loss ( as
will be described in heme section below ).
2. Hematology: The patient has baseline hypoproliferative
normocytic normochromic anemia of chronic disease identified by
iron studies. Her B12 and folate levels were within normal
limits. On 11/8 , the patient had a hematocrit drop from
30-26 , but this was considered to be either a lab variant or due
to blood loss in her subcutaneous tissue from previous Lovenox
injections. Lovenox was discontinued and the team decided to use
TEDs alone for DVT prophylaxis as the patient was ambulatory. On
10/28 , one day post-angio intervention , the patient was complaining of
lethargy. She had a post-procedure crit drop from 30-25 which the
repeat study was stable at 25. Her hemodynamics
was also stable as was her leg exam. The Angiography Team
advised that the hematocrit drop could be as result of blood loss
from recent angio intervention. The Angio Team advised that
there will be no need to pursue imaging to search for source
of blood loss unless the patient has further hematocrit drop or unless she
develops leg , abdominal and back pain symptoms. Because of the
patient&apos;s history of coronary disease , she was ordered for a 2units
a blood. She only received one unit of blood because
she was symptomatic with hypertension and chest pain when the
second bag was hung ( see cardiovascular pump section above ).
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 30.1 and was felt no further
blood would be needed.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. During
this admission , her oral agents were held and the team implemented the
Gatea Insulin Diabetic Protocol using NPH basal
insulin and pre-prandial aspart scales. The hemoglobin A1c was
6.8.
4. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition/renal: The patient had
essentially stable renal function during this admission. A
change in the patient&apos;s creatinine from 7/28/28 was
attributed to medication-induced ( likely from recent lisinopril
dose increased from last GCGH admit , and/or dehydration ). Lasix was
and ACE inhibitor were both held. Lasix and ACE were both
restarted on 3/1 ( see cardiovascular section above ).
5. Gastrointestinal: During this admission the patient had
reported crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. The medical team
suspects possible cause could be ischemia in the setting of
hypertension , as the patient has significant celiac disease that
was identified on an MRA obtained at Palmtial in 10/13 All
stool studies were negative and as on 9/6 her diarrhea
resolved.
6. MISC: After a lengthy discussion with the patient , she opted to be a
DNI otherwise wanted all other resuscitative measures.
IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old female who presents with
complaints of intermittent lightheadedness and sudden onset of
severe chest and abdominal pressure in the setting of
hypertensive urgency with documented blood pressure of 194/74.
Her symptoms resolved with blood pressure control. The medical
team suspects that:
1. The cause of the patient&apos;s episodic lightheadedness prompting
multiple visits to the D.sen Health may be from atrial
fibrillation with RVR and/or ventricular pauses. Additional
workup for this can be pursued by Dr. Gehrer as an outpatient.
2. Given the significant history of vascular disease and the
findings on recent MRA , the team suspects that the patient may
have hypertension-induced gut ischemia and microvascular cardiac
angina.
This is preliminary discharge summary and the discharge addendum
including discharge medications , final diagnoses and medical
followup will need to be dictated at the time of discharge.

Discharge Date: 7/16/2006
ATTENDING: CALVERY , BRADY M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure exacerbation ,
pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED DURING THIS
ADMISSION: Bronchoalveolar cancer , atrial fibrillation ,
hypertension , hypothyroidism , mitral valve repair , and chronic
renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sichel is a 75-year-old female
with past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure with an EF of 30% , mitral valve
repair in 11/26 , lung cancer likely stage IIIB , and atrial
fibrillation , who was recently discharged on 7/22/2006 after
being admitted for acute renal failure and chronic renal failure
and hyperkalemia. Since being discharged on 7/22/2006 , the
patient reported that she had been doing well until the date of
admission when she noticed a 2.5-pound weight gain , increased
shortness of breath with activity and increased oxygen
requirement during the day. She reports that she normally uses 2
liters of oxygen at night , however , she was needing the oxygen
during the day. She also reports 2 episodes of substernal chest
pain which occurred at rest. There was no radiation , no nausea ,
vomiting , or diaphoresis. These episodes of chest pain lasted 3
or 4 minutes and resolved with nitroglycerin sublingual. The
patient also noted that she had been urinating very much , does
report she had been taking all of her medications as directed at
discharge. She thus called her primary cardiologist , Dr.
Bottex , who instructed her to get labs drawn. She was found to
have potassium of 5.4 and a creatinine of 2.3 and thus was told
to report to the ED.

non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Torsemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg
once a day , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Ativan 0.5 mg twice a day
as needed , Colace 100 mg twice a day , Coumadin 1 mg by mouth in
the evening , ferrous sulfate 325 by mouth twice a day , glipizide
5 mg by mouth twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o. daily , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , Nexium
20 daily , pravastatin 40 mg each evening , and Toprol 100 mg by
mouth daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: She had a temperature of
97.3 , pulse of 80 , blood pressure 146/76 , and respiratory rate of
16. O2 saturation of 96% on room air. HEENT: She had moist
mucous membranes. Her oropharynx was clear. She had a left
pupil which was enlarged and nonreactive secondary to that being
a surgical eye. Right eye was reactive. She had no
lymphadenopathy. Lungs: left side was clear to
auscultation. The right side had decreased breath sounds at the
base , few crackles at the right base. Cardiovascular
Examination: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. She had a
normal S1 , S2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and was
found to have a flat JVP on admission. Abdominal Examination:
She had positive bowel sounds , she was soft , nontender ,
nondistended. She did not have any hepatomegaly. Extremities:
She was warm and well perfused. Distal pulses were not palpable.
She did have trace edema , left greater than right which was
chronic. She was alert and oriented x3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Pulmonary/Oncology: The patient was admitted in stable condition
and was requiring 2 liters of oxygen to keep her saturations in
the mid 90s. She had a chest x-ray which showed a right pleural
effusion. Review of previous imaging done on 8/18/2006
demonstrated an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe ,
which was surrounded by a right pleural effusion of moderate
size. The patient also had a PET scan in early August , which
showed that the consolidation lit up extensively. Review of
these studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versus
a bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread. Pulmonary was consulted and
they suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possible
postobstructive pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin ,
vancomycin , and Flagyl on 10/2/2006. She received 7 days of
these antibiotics while in hospital. On day 4 of her
hospitalization , a thoracentesis was performed for both
diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. The pleural fluid
demonstrated a transudative picture. Gram stain was negative.
Cultures did not grow anything. Cytology , preliminary read was
negative. She had 50 white blood cells and 2000 red blood cells
approximately 800 mL were removed and the patient felt much less
short of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much less
oxygen. A followup CT scan was obtained , which showed continued
infiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural
effusion , no pneumothorax was observed. Radiology felt that her
consolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and that
it was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in fact
quite patent and thus it was decided that the patient would
continue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup with
pulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would be
indicated for further workup of this patient&apos;s infiltrate with
followup imaging to occur as well.
Cardiovascularly , for this patient , ischemia wise , the patient
did have 2 episodes of chest pain prior to admission. She did
not have any EKG changes. Two sets of cardiac markers were
obtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did not
have ischemic event that occurred. She was continued on her
aspirin and pravastatin while inhouse. Pump wise , the patient
has a diagnosis of CHF with an EF of 30%. She presented
approximately 2 kg above her dry weight. She was continued on
her home dose of torsemide 40 b.i.d. and also on the isosorbide
dinitrate although this was increased to 10 mg t.i.d. , she was
also started on hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. and did diurese
approximately 500 mL to 1 liter each day. She returned to her
dry weight and on the day of discharge , has a weight of 72.6 kg ,
had been admitted with a dry weight of 74.9 kg. Rhythm wise , the
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was rate
controlled with her metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. Her Coumadin was
continued except for brief period during which it was held prior
to the tap of this. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.
Endocrine wise , this patient&apos;s fingersticks were well controlled.
She was put on a course of Lantus and NovoLog q.a.c. sliding
scale as needed. Fingersticks were maintained within a normal
range. Her Levoxyl was 100 mcg daily , was continued and her
allopurinol 100 mg daily was continued for her history of gout.
On discharge , she is being put back on her glipizide for the
diabetes.
Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. The patient came in
hyperkalemic. She was given Kayexalate 30 mg x1 in the emergency
room to which she responded and had a normal potassium throughout
her hospital stay.
Renal. For this , the patient with her diuresis she did and with
the addition of the hydralazine , she did have her creatinine drop
from 2.2 down to 1.7 during her hospital admission on the day of
discharge , it was 1.9 , which is within her baseline for her
chronic renal insufficiency.
Hematology wise , the patient had a stable hematocrit in the low
30s. She was continued on her iron 325 twice a day for her iron
deficiency anemia. LENI&apos;s also performed and showed no evidence of DVT.
On the day of discharge , notable findings on physical exam , she
was afebrile. Heart rate was 71 to 85. Blood pressure 100-114
over 40-66. She was saturating 93% to 97% on room air.
Cardiovascular Examination: She was irregularly irregular. S1 ,
S2 were present. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Her
JVP was noted to be 9 cm. Examination of her lungs revealed that
they were clear to auscultation on the left. On the right , she
had crackles approximately halfway up , but did not have decreased
breath sounds as noted on admission. She did not have any
pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , allopurinol 100 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg twice a day , ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice a
day , glipizide 5 mg twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg 3
times a day , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily ,
Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m. , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , pravastatin 40
mg daily , torsemide 40 mg twice a day , Nexium 20 mg daily ,
levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth , q.48h. for a total course of 4 more
doses , hydralazine 10 mg 3 times a day , Ativan 0.5 mg as needed.
DISPOSITION: The patient was in stable condition.
PENDING TESTS: Final pathology report on the cytology studies
from her thoracentesis is still pending.
FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has an appointment scheduled with
her primary care physician , Dr. Theo Damien on 5/27/2006.
The patient has a followup with pulmonary medicine on 10/1/2006
with Dr. Cahue

Discharge Date: 11/19/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY
2. ASTHMA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41 year old
Afro-American woman who has the
diagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on 4/26/95
transferred from Rahert Hospital for postmyocardial infarction
angina.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension , smoking , family history of
coronary artery disease , and CVA. No
diabetes. She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevated
cholesterol. No previous myocardial infarction history.
Two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had
20 minutes of Cushing substernal chest pressure , increased
shortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the left
arm and across to the right chest. Initially , she thought she had
gastrointestinal distress. Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours after
eating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable if
affected by position. There were no EKG changes. In the intervening
period she had several additional episodes of this pain and
presented to HMC where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.
The pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 4/26/95 when she
presented to LSSHA with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chest
pressure. She was sent to Ai Community Hospital where she ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of
126 with a peak of 1900 on 8/6 EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 and
ADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 through
V5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,
diltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additional
pain while on this regimen and was transferred to the Campte Hospital for catheterization and management.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications as an outpatient were only
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer her
medications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once a
day , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IV
nitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood
- she gets hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery disease and
cerebrovascular accident in the early 40&apos;s in both
her father and mother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for the
past 20 years with occasional alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit at
the Mouth- Butlham Hospital is notable
for a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rate
of 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. HEENT exam -
sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,
extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. There were
no carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. Chest -
there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. Lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No CVA
tenderness. Cardiac exam - PMI nondisplaced , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , split S2. There is a 2 out of 6 whooshing
crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border that radiates to the apex. There was an S4. Abdomen - obese
with a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.
Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Reflexes were intact. Toes were
downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for potassium of 3.8 , a white
blood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of
37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and CK of 201 , PT-PTT 13.2 ,
59 with an INR of 1.2. Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 white
blood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+
leukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failure
on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for
an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing
postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina
versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support
this. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,
aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV
nitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for
a catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with
pretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish
allergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95
with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,
pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM
( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with
good distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were
deemed normal. On the 7 of October , the patient was transferred
out of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,
postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit
on the right which was there prior to catheterization. An
echocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%
with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the
7 of October , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell
count of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave
inversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG&apos;s from
1/7 The patient&apos;s MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion
from the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this
time that the increased white blood cell count was most likely
secondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to
catheterization. The patient&apos;s does of Lopressor was increased to
75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60&apos;s. She was
continued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and
continued on cardiac monitor. On the 29 of July , the patient
had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left
arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight
diaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being
weaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse
of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new
murmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R
which were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2
which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one
sublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.
She was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol and
Serax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with
these interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described it
as a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG at
this point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. T
wave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5
with T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IV
nitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was divided
and oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient was
pain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressor
was given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode was
approximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate
of 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave
upright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for a
blood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IV
morphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sent
and Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPO
in case of any need for catheterization the following morning if
symptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnified
with a triponin I of 14.1. On the 29 of July it was deemed
appropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day and
control symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were to
increase , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this
patient for recurrent cath. On the 20 of February , the patient
returned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%
distal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of this
distal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent was
placed in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.
The lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%
stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in the
proximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for a
total of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG&apos;s were
stable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in the
right groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the 18 of November
the patient&apos;s Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient was
started on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on
6 of October had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with a
blood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient was
being coumadinized on the 18 of February , she had a
supertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. The
plan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well as
to start planning for discharge. On the 24 of April , the INR
was 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximum
INR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.
DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home on June with
followup with Dr. Mathur and Dr. Stailey at the For Nali Hospital
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol
Suppositories one suppository pr q day ,

465093381 | DESCMH | 64572761 | | 105004 | 2/6/2001 12:00:00 AM | ARRYTHMIA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 11/9/2001 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 3/16/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old female
with a history of lupus , hypertension ,
asthma , breast cancer status post mastectomy and chemotherapy ,
rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation who was found
pauses of up to 6.6 seconds on a Holter monitor and was admitted
for consideration of pacer placement. The patient states that over
the last several months since October , 2001 , she has noted
increasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance.
She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. She presented to her
primary care physician in October , 2001 with these complaints. He
put a Holter monitor on her 10/1/01 which showed her to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates between 67 and 214 with a
mean rate of 117 beats per minute. Her primary care physician , Dr.
Esmond , initially put the patient on digoxin and Coumadin. Her
rate remained elevated , however , so he changed the Coumadin to
Cardizem. About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. On 10/5 she presented to her cardiologist , Dr.
Cowser , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema.
He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what was
contributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her on
atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. She had a leepy Holter monitor
placed from 8/29/23. Wednesday morning , her second day of
atenolol , she noted having episodes where &quot;I felt my heart pause
and then surge when it started to beat again&quot;. This was associated
with lightheadedness x several seconds. She did not have any
associated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting ,
diaphoresis or syncope. She called Dr. Cedotal on 6/16 and he
told her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. Over
the last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heart
beat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol on
Wednesday. She has noted increased shortness of breath over the
last couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs.
She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not have
PND , does have lower extremity edema. On the day of admission
which was 10/25/01 Dr. Mcferrin received a transmitted Holter recording
from Viewden Medical Center that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with
episodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that she
had episodes of 6.6 second pauses. Thus , she called the patient
and had her sent via ambulance to the Cole General Health
emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker
placement. In the emergency department the patient&apos;s vitals were
she was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 ,
breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. Her review of systems was
negative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope ,
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. In
the emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sent
to the floor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a 52-year-old female
resting comfortably at 45 degrees , in no
acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light
and accommodation. Oropharynx revealed moist mucous membranes , no
erythema. Neck veins appeared to be around 10 cm. CHEST:
Wheezing bilaterally and crackles at both bases. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1S2 , did have an S4 and did have a
3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex to the axilla. She
also had a 1/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left upper
sternal border. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with good
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused. She did have 2+
lower extremity edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 146 , potassium 3.6 ,
chloride 117 , bicarb 19 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 ,
glucose 120 , CK 76 , troponin 0 , CBC showed a white count of 8.73 ,
hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. Her baseline had
been 30-38 on the last admission. Her platelets were 289. ESR was
75 which is what it had been in July . INR was 3.1
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
redistribution. Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at
94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. She did have left atrial
enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. Her last echo
done at MH on 10/13/01 showed an ejection fraction of 63% ,
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic function
preserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened ,
mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderately
increased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrial
enlargement and they made notes that the mitral regurgitation was
increased on this echo when compared with an echo done one year
prior at BKTMC .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Breast cancer status post left
mastectomy with lymph node dissection
in 5/1 Pathology revealed invasive
ductal carcinoma , grade 3/3 , node
negative. She is status post four
cycles of Adriamycin and cytoxan.
2. History of lupus x 21 years.
3. History of rheumatic heart disease.
4. History of hypertension.
5. History of asthma diagnosed three years
ago.
6. History of recent atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lisinopril 40 q.d.; prednisone 10 q.d.;
Coumadin 5 q.d.; Prevacid 30 q.d.;
chloroquine 100 q.d.; Plaquenil 200 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 q.d.;
albuterol inhaler p.r.n.; Flovent 220 2-3 puffs b.i.d.; Flonase
b.i.d.; propafenone 150 t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Tetracycline which give her nausea and vomiting
and sometimes she got that with aspirin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nurse currently on a medical leave of
absence. She lives alone. Tobacco history she
does smoke 1 pack per day since she was 23. No ethanol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Brother with sarcoid plus a history of
hypertension. Father with prostate cancer.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: From an ischemia standpoint
she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. We
did continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril 40 q.d.
From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral
regurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history of
increasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and
increasing orthopnea. Thus , we got a repeat echo which showed
borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejection
fraction of 55% , normal RV. The mitral valve was moderately
thickened and rheumatic in appearance. The mitral valve area was
estimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an under
estimate. There is severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left
atrial enlargement. The aortic valve was calcified. There was
mild aortic insufficiency. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation
with a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevation
in pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus right
atrial pressure. Given her severe and symptomatic mitral
regurgitation we then decided that she would likely benefit from a
mitral valve replacement. Then we proceeded to cardiac
catheterization. Her left heart catheterization showed a left
dominant system with clean coronary arteries. Her right heart
catheterization revealed elevated right ventricular and pulmonary
artery pressures and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
31. She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IV
Lasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterload
reduction. Consultation with Dr. Mazingo of cardiothoracic surgery
was obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly
from an MVR. Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged home
and then to be readmitted electively when Dr. Brocks returned from
vacation for an MVR. From a rate and rhythm standpoint , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital
stay. We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history of
atrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control on
this. She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stay
and thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did not
have any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not need
pacemaker placement on this admission.
2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she
had cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of
breath was nearly 100% improved.
3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was in
good control. She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptoms
such as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her on
her Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone.
4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of her
lupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughout
her stay.
5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within her
baseline range of 29-38. Full iron studies were sent and it was
felt that it was most likely consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.
6 ) Prophylaxis: From a prophylaxis standpoint she was on Coumadin
for atrial fibrillation so was not considered for heparin and she
was continued on Prilosec throughout her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; lisinopril 40
mg p.o.q.d.; magnesium gluconate 2 grams
p.o. b.i.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. a.m.; propafenone 225 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.; K-Dur 60 mEq p.o.q.d.; Flovent 220
mg inhaled b.i.d.; Flonase 2 sprays nasally q.d. for her allergies
and postnasal drip; Prevacid 30 mg p.o.q.d.; chloroquine 100 mg
p.o.q.d.; Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOWUP: She had an appointment to follow up with Dr. Flecther
in one week&apos;s time and to follow up with Dr. Druvenga in
two weeks&apos; time when he returned from vacation. At that time would
then follow up with an elective admission for MVR.

Discharge Date: 3/30/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Hispanic
female with insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus and hypertension , who fell at home approximately 1 week
before admission. She suffered a right-sided Colles fracture that
was treated with closed reduction and half cast. Furthermore , she
suffered a nondisplaced left-sided patella fracture , which was
primarily treated with a knee immobilizer. Since the follow-up
x-ray of the distal radius 1 week after trauma showed shortening
and dorsal angulation , the patient was admitted for closed
reduction and external fixation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY reveals
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , anxiety. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY reveals she is status post open reduction and
internal fixation of a left-sided tibial plateau fracture 9 months
ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Verapamil 80 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Chlorthalidone 50 milligrams by mouth per day ,
humulin-N 40 units subcutaneously each morning , multivitamin 1
tablet by mouth per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a 62 year old
female in no acute distress. Lungs were
clear. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rate and rhythm ,
III/VI holosystolic murmur , regular S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities showed the right forearm and wrist immobilized in a
splint , there was regular VMF of all 5 digits , good capillary
refill , radial and ulnar pulses were 2+/2+. Left knee had positive
effusion , no signs of ligamentous instability , straight leg raising
possible , but with 15 to 20 degree extension deficit.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , x-ray of the left knee , PA
and lateral , shows nondislocated patella
fracture ( fracture line almost not visible ). Distal radius PA and
lateral showed shortening and dorsal angulation of the articulate
surface. On admission , electrolytes were within normal limits ,
blood urea nitrogen 23 , creatinine 1.3 , hemoglobin 13.0 , hematocrit
38.2 , white count 8 , 100 , platelet count 411 , 000 , prothrombin time
12.3 , partial thromboplastin time 23.4. Urinalysis was without
pathological findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 9 of February , the patient underwent closed reduction
and external fixation of her distal radial
fracture. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and the
postoperative course was without complications. Postoperative
x-ray control showed an optimal result with anatomical reduction of
the radial articulate surface. During the early postoperative
course , the radial ramus of the radial nerve seemed to be
irritated , but recovered without any further intervention and the
patient was without any neurological deficit from the 4th
postoperative day on. While the left leg was immobilized with a
brace , the patient started to ambulate with a platform walker and
with full weight-bearing on the left leg. Prior to discharge , the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Serial electrolytes ,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits.
Leukocytes were 8 , 000 , hemoglobin 12.9 , hematocrit 38.0 , platelet
count 489 , 000 , last blood glucose level prior to discharge from
7:00 am was 169 , 4:00 pm 73 , 10:00 pm 230. The pin sites on the
right forearm were without signs of infection. X-ray control done
on 13 of August , showed unchanged positioning of the right radius , as
well as the left patella.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE are the same as on
admission. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The
patient is going home. The plan is for postoperative FOLLOW-UP in
1 week at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Wyckbastroit Center .
Until then , the patient is advised to keep the right arm elevated
and to seek medical attention in case of fever , reddening of the
pin sites , and/or secretion from any pin site. Hence , the patient
is not able to do her finger sticks for blood sugar measurement by
herself , and Visiting Nurse Association was ordered.

Discharge Date: 4/19/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UROSEPSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old male
with diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis
and hypertension who had a fever of 102 and shaking chills without
symptoms of upper respiratory infection. He did complain of
intermittent dysuria and he is known to have prostatism. He was
therefore admitted to the Medicine Service. Past medical history
is coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , diabetes
mellitus , rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. Past surgical
history is negative. He has no known drug allergies. Medications
on admission are Tenormin , Dolobid , Diabinase , Mevacor , Ecotrin ,
Nifedipine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a mildly ill-appearing white male
in no acute distress , afebrile with
stable vital signs. Head and neck are unremarkable. Lungs are
clear. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI
holosystolic murmur. Abdomen is nontender. GU examination on
admission by the Emergency Room internist was not recorded.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission are remarkable for a white
blood cell count of 12.2 thousand ,
creatinine 1.2. Urinalysis had a pH of 5.5 , 1+ leukocyte esterase
and too numerous to count white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the
diagnosis of urosepsis and placed on
intravenous antibiotics. He was transferred to the urology service
after consideration of his prostatism was made and he would be an
eventual candidate for transurethral resection of the prostate.
During his hospitalization , he promptly defervesced and remained
afebrile for three days. He was therefore changed to oral
antibiotics and observed for 24-hours and because he was stable , he
was felt to be ready for discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable. Follow
up is with Dr. Jerald B. Sultana MEDICATIONS on discharge are
Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , Procardia XL
60 mg p.o. q. day , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q. day , Diabinase 100 mg p.o.
q. day , Ecotrin 1 tablet p.o. q. day , Hytrin 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. and
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. x ten days.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was admitted for IV
antibiotics and further surgical therapy with the diagnosis of
dehiscence of left thigh bypass graft wound. He received
wet-to-dry dressing changes t.i.d. initially. On 3/2/2003 , he
was taken to the operating room for left groin closure with flap
by Plastic Surgery and Vascular Surgery. The flap initially was
pink and viable , however , on 5/14/2003 , there were noted some
pale areas and mottling of the flap. He was injected with
heparin solution. Following this , flap received serial needle
pricks and the appearance gradually improved as such there was no
further pallor or mottling. The patient developed diarrhea. He
was on vancomycin , levofloxacin , with p.o. Flagyl for empiric
treatment for C. diff. C. diff cultures were negative on
10/16/2003 , in addition his drain cultures on 10/20/2003 , showed

Cardiology during his stay here. On postoperative #2 , he was
noted to be volume overloaded. His torsemide was increased to
100 mg b.i.d. with goal diuresis of 1-2 liters per day. IV Lasix
was added p.r.n. to achieve this goal. After his episode of
nausea , his EKG was checked to rule out any sort of cardio
ischemic cause for this nausea , EKG was normal. His morphine was
discontinued as a possible cause. He did well with p.o. pain
medications. Renal: His Zestril was held secondary to an
elevation in creatinine to 3.3 from his baseline of 1.8. This
gradually resolved. Creatinine was 2.5 at the time of discharge.

his lower extremities. His reflexes were 1-2+ in his upper
extremities and approximately 3+ at the knees with downgoing toes.
He had 3-4 beat clonus on the right. Coordination was okay
bilaterally. Gait tested revealed a tendency to fall with
decreased ability to weight bear on the right. Sensory exam
revealed decreased sensation in the right hand and the last three
digits of the left hand. He had no subjective numbness in his
right leg , on the dorsum of his left foot , he had decreased
sensation with a cut off before the toes.

stenosis at C5-6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by Dr. Dubey who agreed
with the plan for C5-6 and C6-7 laminectomies.
He was taken to the operating room on 10/8/93. Preoperative
diagnosis with cervical stenosis with myelopathy. Postoperative

very well. He had good upper extremity strength which seemed to
improve. He was seen by physical therapy. He had a slightly
swollen calf and had noninvasive vascular studies of his lower
extremities which were negative. He did , however , note some
shooting pain in his left lower extremity. His wound was clean and
healing well. He was out of bed with a walker. The plan was for
discharge home. He may need further evaluation of his lumbar spine
at some point but he seems to be doing well with Percocet only.

Hospital Course:
57 yo F with complex medical history here with mental status
change likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with some component of
medication-induced delirium ( from opiates ).
++Mental Status - Avoided increasing narcotics. Given lactulose QID.
Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours of
hospitalization. Patient then remained at her baseline mental status for
rest of hospital stay.
++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that is
likely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on
6/5/06. We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of her
altered mental status. Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn ,
celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? increase risk of
cardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. Other
NSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. Patient is scheduled to f/u with
Dr. Stayner ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain and
consideration of sacroplasty. Patient should be seen by PT at her nursing
home to help her with her walking.
++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2. Patient had mild
RUQ tenderness which raised a question of possible GI / biliary source of
infection. Blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph in 2/4
bottles. She was treated with Ciprofloxacin and
Metronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of blood
cultures. Blood cultures repeated on 11/18 and 7/27
were negative to date. Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to be
due to contamination. Patient has remained afebrile and abdominal
tenderness has resolved over hospital stay. Vancomycin was discontinued
on HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. She was discharged with
instructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. Her WBC
count and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay and
were 3.88 and 122 respectively. A CBC should be checked on Monday 6/25 to
make sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic.
++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremity
swelling and her change in mental status. Given that she was at her
baseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to be
low probability. She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98%
on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. Given flovent for
known COPD.
++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. Patient&apos;s dose
of Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. Her
heart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout her
admission.
++Endo: MRI read from 3/8/06 showed evidence of osteoporosis. Started
caltrate , vit D. Unable to give fosamax because of history of esophageal
varices. Giving zometa x 1. Corrected calcium was normal. Will need to
re-check calcium in 1 week.
++FEN - Given thiamine , folate , fluids , Is/Os , weights.
++PPX - Lovenox , nexium , aspiration precautions.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You are being discharged from the hospital to your nursing home in
Smerfortn Blvd , Stin with a few changes in your medications. We have changed your pain
medication to MSIR every 4 hr as needed , celebrex , and lidoderm patch.
Please call your doctor if you are feeling that your thinking is not
clear or if you start to have fevers. And please return to the emergency
department if you are having increased abdominal pain , chest pain ,
difficulty breathing , or other concerning symptoms. You should have your

Megeath office to schedule. Follow up with Dr. Blandin and Dr. Pfleider
as scheduled. Patient should be seen by physical therapy at her nursing
home. Patient should have a CBC drawn on Monday 6/25 to check her white
count and platements , which were trending down slowly throughout her
admission and recheck calcium ( corrected for albumin ) in one week.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73 year old male who
immigrated from Co Garlpaaran approximately
fifteen years ago. He has had a several year history of
constipation but no melena , hematochezia , weight loss , night
sweats , chills , abdominal pain , or change in size/caliber of stool.
His daughters were concerned about the long history of constipation
and therefore scheduled a colonoscopy. On 10/5/94 , the patient
underwent a colonoscopy at Talchip Harb Community Hospital and a mass was
noted in the transverse colon. A biopsy was taken and the results
are not known but were reported to Dr. Jorski as colon cancer.
CT of the abdomen on 6/3/94 revealed no adenopathy or evidence of
metastasis but an infrarenal IVC dilatation of approximately 3 cm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-Insulin dependent diabetes times ten
years , coronary artery disease with a history of coronary artery
bypass graft in 1990 , hypercholesterolemia , and low back pain.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for an appendectomy as a young
man and a coronary artery bypass graft times three vessels in 1990.

ischemia or infarct.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and pre-operatively , was
seen by a Cardiology consultant who cleared the
patient for surgery and recommended following serial CK , MB , and
EKG but not a formal rule out protocol. The patient was taken to
the Operating Room on 10/24/94 where he underwent a mid transverse
to mid descending colectomy and primary anastomosis. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was stable post-operatively.
Patient continued to progress well without any difficulty and had
no evidence of ischemia or changes on the EKG. On post-operative
day number three , the patient developed a productive cough and
chest X-Ray was obtained which showed only atelectasis and small
bilateral effusions but no consolidation or infiltrate. Patient
was encouraged to cough and deep breath and the productive cough
resolved without any antibiotic treatment. The nasogastric tube
was discontinued on post-operative day number five and the patient
began tolerating clear sips without any difficulty. By

Discharge Date: 4/14/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old female
with history of an inferior myocardial
infarction , coronary artery disease , and diverticulosis initially
admitted on 11/6/98 for conservative treatment of acute
diverticulitis. She was discharged on 10/30/98. The patient now
presents for elective sigmoid colectomy. The patient had had no
recent angina since her prior admission in January of 1998. According
to the patient she has rare , about one time every two weeks ,
episode of stable angina which presents as left arm pain relieved
by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient did not present with any
pattern of unstable angina. The patient denies recent fevers ,
chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum ,
melena , cough , or pneumonia. The patient does report dyspnea on
exertion after climbing approximately one flight of stairs. The
patient has orthopnea as she sleeps with two pillows.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Status post myocardial infarction times two.
History of atrial fibrillation. History of
atrial flutter. Status post cardioversion times three in 1994.
History of hypertension. History of rheumatic heart disease.
History of congestive heart failure. Non-insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. History of two deep venous thromboses in 1970s.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Mitral valve commissurotomy. Mitral valve
repair with St. Jude&apos;s valve in 1981.
Appendectomy. Left hip fracture.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa , aspirin , Sotalol , as well as
Procainamide and Quinaglute.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg , Lopressor 180 mg t.i.d. , Glyburide 10 mg
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , Plaquenil 200 mg
b.i.d. , Isordil tempids 40 mg t.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well developed , well nourished female in no
acute distress. Lungs clear to auscultation
without crackles. Heart: Mechanical S1 and normal S2. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , nondistended. Bowel sounds positive. 2+ edema to
calves bilaterally. Feet were warm and dry with normal capillary
refill.
LABORATORY DATA: ECG was significant for normal rate , atrial
fibrillation rhythm. No acute ST-T wave changes.
The patient had Q-waves in leads 3 and aVF. The patient&apos;s x-ray
was consistent with pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The cardiology service was consulted with the
recommendations that the patient be diuresed
aggressively , daily weights and ins-and-outs be followed , and fluid
and sodium restriction to patient. The patient was placed on
heparin preoperatively.
On hospital day #2 preoperatively , the patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit after she experienced a hypotensive
event with systolic blood pressure in the 50s with associated
drowsiness while maintaining her own airway. The feeling was that
the patient&apos;s event was likely secondary to the initiation of
Verapamil for rate control of her atrial fibrillation. The rate
control was then continued with Lopressor and Verapamil was held.
Goal potassium greater than 3.5 and magnesium greater than 2 were
maintained. The patient&apos;s diuresis was continued. The patient was
felt to be stable for surgery.
On hospital day #3 , 3/29/98 , the patient was brought to the
operating room for sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis , as
well as drainage of abscess. Postoperatively , the patient was
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring of her cardiopulmonary issues. Postoperatively , the
patient progressed well. She was maintained on perioperative
Vancomycin , Levofloxacin , and Flagyl. Cardiovascularly , she was
maintained on Lopressor , Nitropaste , Hydralazine , and Digoxin for
her atrial flutter. The patient did well on the floor , tolerating
IV to p.o. pain control , reinstitution of Coumadin for
anticoagulation , tolerating regular activity. Of note ,
the patient completed a rule out for myocardial infarction by
serial enzymes and ECGs. The patient was seen by the physical
therapy service and noted to have progressively improving activity.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to the Chemu Ford11 Memorial ,
a rehabilitation hospital. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Plaquenil 200 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil tempids 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg

p.o. q4 - 6h p.r.n. pain , Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times six
days- starting on 6/11/98 , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. qhs for evenings of
8/21/98 and 3/27/98 ; 5 mg p.o. q.d. starting on 5/6/98. The
patient should have PT and PTT with INR checked three times a week
on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday. She has a goal INR of 3.0. The
patient is not being discharged on Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d. because
she has had consistently low blood sugars. Fingerstick blood
glucose should be checked b.i.d. with resumption of Glyburide when
necessary. FOLLOWUP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Ezra Tripodi in the Ispunx Medical Center surgical clinic in one to two weeks. She
should call to schedule an appointment. The patient should also

According to patient , while on her way back from her sleep apnea clinic
appointment , she felt a sudden pressure from her &apos;head down.&apos; She had
been holding onto a strap on the bus with her left hand and suddenly
felt unable to hold on any longer and she felt tingling on her left arm.
While this was happening , she also became acutely confused and didn&apos;t
recognize her own neighborhood or even the house across from hers. She
was able to stand up and walk off of the bus as well as up five steps on
her front porch with assistance from the bus driver. By the time she
reached the front porch , 5 minutes after her symptoms started , she was
back to her normal self. At no time during this did she experience
headache , dizziness , vision/hearing changes , abnormal smell or nausea.
Her other extremities were not involved. She also never lost
consciousness.

Discharge Date: 10/26/1992
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS IS CEREBRAL
PALSY WITH MENTAL RETARDATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 27 year old black man
with a history of cerebral palsy and
mental retardation who now presents with chest pain of three days
duration. His cardiac risk factors include positive family history
and a history of hypertension. He does not smoke tobacco and has
no history of diabetes. Note that the patient is a very poor
historian , however , through his mother , he complains of
approximately three weeks of increasing fatigue and malaise. The
week prior to admission , he had a single episode of chest pain at
&quot;work&quot; ( actually his day activity center ) which resolved
spontaneously. Three days prior to admission , the patient had
poorly defined chest pain with marked diaphoresis. This pain was
worse with deep inspiration and , in addition , he had generalized
nausea and malaise with shortness of breath. This pain waxed and
waned over the day and was not exertional in nature. He was seen
at Childmiltrich Health Care where no laboratories were drawn and he was
referred to follow-up on Friday. One day before admission , the
patient had chest pain radiating to the left upper arm with
numbness in that extremity. He had nausea and occasional
diaphoresis. He had an echocardiogram on that day at Tal Hospital which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no
regional wall motion abnormality and was otherwise normal. On the
day of admission , the patient complained of increased severity of
chest pain with shortness of breath. He &quot;felt sick&quot; but denied
vomiting or diaphoresis. He came to the Sta Medical Center Emergency Room where he continued to complain of chest
pain radiating to the left shoulder as well as into the abdomen.
This symptom was worsened with inspiration as well as with central
sternal palpation. At baseline , the patient does little exercise
secondary to his cerebral palsy , he has three-pillow orthopnea but
no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and he has no prior episodes of
chest pain except as described above. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for cerebral palsy as above and also for pneumonia in
1986. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes no medications. ALLERGIES:
He has no allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke tobacco ,
he does not drink alcohol , and he does not use intravenous drugs.
He is a regular church goer , he lives with his mother , and attends
a day rehabilitation care center. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for
angina in his mother and a grandfather with coronary artery
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was afebrile , his blood pressure was
160/130 , heart rate was 65 , respiratory rate
was 20 , and he was 98% saturated on room air. He was an obese
black man in no acute distress. SKIN: Clear. HEENT: The
oropharynx was clear , there was no jugular venous distention ,
carotids were 2+ and equal , pupils were equal , round , and reactive
to light and accommodation , and the neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy. The fundi were not well seen secondary to poor
cooperation. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: There was a
regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 were heard , and there was a
II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
ABDOMEN: Obese with positive bowel sounds , it was non-tender ,
slightly tympanitic , there was no hepatosplenomegaly , and the
patient was guaiac negative. EXTREMITIES: Examination revealed no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. There was no focal tenderness and
pulses were intact bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: He was alert and
oriented times three and he was unable to do simple calculations ,
however , cranial nerves II-XII were intact. Sensory and motor in
the upper and lower extremities were within normal limits , reflexes
were brisk and symmetric , and toes went down.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an
axis of 0 degrees and normal intravals.
There was left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in aVL and there
were no acute ST or T wave changes , however , there was no old EKG
for comparison. An SMA 7 was benign , a CK on admission was 283
with 10 MB , white count was 9.4 , and urinalysis was negative.
Chest X-Ray initially revealed evidence of pulmonary vascular
redistribution , however , a repeat chest X-Ray an hour later was
clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor and given
his rather indistinct complaints , a broad-based
work-up was initiated including a rule out for myocardial
infarction. Although the patient continued to have elevated CK
with elevated MB , these were electrophoresed and found not to be
MB. There was concern given the pleuritic nature of his chest pain
that the patient may have suffered a pulmonary embolism. Lower
extremity non-invasives were negative as was a VQ scan. The
patient was kept on cardiac monitor until his rule out for
myocardial infarction was complete. Throughout his
hospitalization , the patient continued to complain of diffuse body
pain as well as &quot;feeling sick&quot; , however , he continued to be
afebrile with normal laboratories. On the second hospital day , the
patient became aware of the fact that his mother had been admitted
to an outside hospital for a rule out myocardial infarction. He
became quite agitated and at that time complained of increasing
abdominal pain. He was treated with laxatives and reassurance and
seemed improved. On the fourth hospital day , it was felt that the
patient was not suffering from any serious illness and that the
most dangerous entities had been ruled out. It was felt that he
was most likely suffering from a viral flu syndrome. His blood
pressure was controlled with a beta blocker and he was discharged
in stable condition to home.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Nifedipine XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. , and Pepcid 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He will follow-up with Dr. Fugatt in HAYSC HOSPITAL Clinic in one
month&apos;s time.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: During this admission we evaluated your heart to make sure that it
was not the cause of your pain. In fact , your studies were improved from
your previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likely
more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we
performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you
have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if
that helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small
doses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic
form in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys
so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge
summary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital
we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day
instead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your
medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your
admission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or
any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Adjust pain medications for shoulder pain
2. Referral for physical therapy
3. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemics if FSBGs are high - oral agents have
been reduced to once daily as pt was hypoglycemic on admission

The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan and is status post cycle 2 on 9/6/06 and began to
feel like she was recovering from her chemotherapy approximately
three days prior to admission. A spinal MRI obtained on Tuesday
to evaluate her spinal stenosis was uneventful but later on that

following morning the patient had a pustular lesion on the fourth
digit of her right hand distal to the dorsal redness and went to
EH Urgent Care where she received one dose of ceftriaxone and
was given a p.o. script for Augmentin. She was sent home but at

veteran and came back to the Ra and was service
connected with the pofield medical center of psychiatric
disturbances following his tour of duty. She has had three sons ,
two twins who died earlier in life of some unspecified heart
illness and a third son who died at the age of 21 after a long
hospital stay with clear cell sarcoma of bone. She lives alone
in a second floor walkup in Du near Inslareca Cou Pla She
has a distant history of tobacco 50 years ago. She rarely drinks
alcohol. Her friend and healthcare proxy is Ezekiel Stoviak , and
the phone # 288-186-2874.
FAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of breast cancer. Mother
had colon cancer. Three aunts and maternal grandmother also had
colon cancer. Her son had a clear cell sarcoma of bone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
lightheadedness and dizziness associated with her chemo but she
denies fevers , chills , sweats in the past 72 to 96 hours prior to
admission. She did have chest pain on 3/28/06 two days after
her chemo but none since and in the time leading up to her
hospitalization.
ADMISISON PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature was 98.9 , pulse 98 , blood
pressure 132/55 , respiratory rate 16 , 95% on room air. The
patient&apos;s physical exam was significant for alopecia and obesity.
She was in no acute distress , alert and oriented. Her pupils
were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was
anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess
due to neck fullness and she wears hearing aids. The lungs were
clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds with
crackles at the left base. Cardiovascular exam was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 , S2 and no murmur , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and benign. Extremities had trace to 1+ edema.
The patient had an approximately 4 x 2 cm area of redness but no
swelling , positive warmth and positive tenderness on the dorsal
surface of her right hand. She had a pustular lesion on her left
fourth digit and right third digit that had been I&amp;D in AH
Urgent Care.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs are significant for creatinine of 1 , white
blood cell count of 4.33 , hematocrit of 25.5 and platelets of
108. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a leftward axis and
first degree AV block. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 72-year-old woman with
stage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with
paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV
vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her
finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within
two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage
of her left hand&apos;s pustular lesion with improved speed of healing
and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient&apos;s
vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient
developed a area of redness on her left forearm that measured
approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an
erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear
to be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar
lesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The
patient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious
Disease consultants were called to assist with the management of
the patient&apos;s evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no
vegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The
Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had
paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation
due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.
The concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially
treated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that
were not in distribution that has been consistent with septic
emboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from
vancomycin to Keflex and within 12 hours developed new
maculopapular rash on her right neck and furuncles on her left
and right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient
was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on
Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether
the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she
was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and
topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the
right neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were
symptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in
addition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.
Throughout the course of evolving dermatologic findings that the
patient experienced and the pain associated with them the patient
had continued to have absolutely no systemic complications
associated with these lesions. In particular , she did not have
fever at all during the course of her hospitalization , she did
not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,
and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.
The patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash
developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to
Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection
though cultures remained pending at the time of discharge. The
patient will be discharged on Keflex and Valtrex to complete a
course of ten days on each.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes , was
placed on a weight based insulin regimen with good effect during
the course of her hospitalization. On discharge , she will resume
her Lantus 40 units nightly.
Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a clean cath in 2005. Her aspirin , statin ,
Zestril , Cardizem , Lasix and nitrates were continued during the
course of her hospitalization in the same way that she takes them
at home with very well controlled blood pressures and no issues
with her rhythm.
The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea but does not
use CPAP and do not have any difficulties with her oxygenation
even while sleeping.
Heme: The patient was initially anemic and thrombocytopenic on
admission. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and
her hematocrit remained stable through the duration of her
hospitalization.
Oncology: The patient has ductal carcinoma and inflammatory
breast cancer that is likely stage IV and she is status post
cycle 2 of 16 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan with a plan for surgical removal after her
chemotherapy.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services and physical therapy at home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n.
headache , aspirin 81 mg daily , Lipitor 40 mg daily , bacitracin

pt ruled out for MI by enzymes , with
no EKG ischemic changes , and was treated with Lovenox. At GMH , pt had
an episode of asymptomatic atrial
tachycardia , resolving spontaneously. On 8/11/02 ,
pt was transferred to MHC for cardiac cath and potential
stent/brachytherapy if necessary.
Hospital
course:
CV - Pt underwent cath 3/24/02. Both stents
from 3/10 were found to be stenosed ( LACX 85% and diagonal 95% ).
LAD had 50% stenosis. Stents were tx w/ angioplasty and brachytherapy.
Pt placed on integrilin IV for 14 hours. Pt ruled out per routine for
MI by CK after procedure. He had no episodes of chest pain after his
admission to GUH .
- Pt has had multiple episodes of
asymptomatic
afib , aflutter , and atrial tachycardia , with RVR into the 150&apos;s , with
rate responding
well to 5mg IV lopressor. On 4/29/02 , lopressor increased to
75mg po tid in hopes of achieving rhythm/rate
control , unsucessfully. EP was consulted as to a possible ablation
procedure , but felt that medical management , if possible , would be a
better solution , given that multifocal atrial tachycardias and afib
would not necessary be resolved with an ablation procedure. The
patient also preferred medical management. On 1/27/02 , verapamil
40mg po tid was added to the regimen , with patient still having
episodes of rapid heart rate. Verapamil was increased to 80mg po
tid with resulting rate control. However , patient had two episodes
of asymptomatic low BP ( 90/50 ). On 4/6/02 , verapamil was decreased
to 60mg po tid , with both HR and BP control. Abnormal rhythms
continued , without RVR.
- Given afib/aflutter rhythms , patient was placed on coumadin 5mg po qd
on 1/27/02 ( prior to his procedure , he was maintained on heparin drip ,
and immediately post-procedure , he was maintained on integrilin drip ).
- Pt placed on statin at ACH ; maintained on statin at AMC . Patient
maintained on asa.
- New d/c medications: Given difficulty of maintaining patient&apos;s heart
rate and blood pressure , pt was d/c&apos;ed on verapamil and lopressor ,
both tid drugs. At f/u appt with cardiologist or PCP , this regimen
can be altered as appropriate. Pt also d/c&apos;d on coumadin , plavix
( for 6months ) , and simvastatin.
Pulm - Severe COPD , treated with home O2.
Baseline O2 92% on 2L , and SOB with minor exertion. Pt
was tx w/ steroids until 6 months ago.
Continued on theophylline , flovent , serevent ,
guifenisin , atrovent inhaler prn. Stable while in hospital.
Endo - Pt was given one dose of solumedrol in SCH . FS high ( low 200&apos;s )
on admission; he was begun on an insulin SS , but did not require
insulin while in hospital.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please return to hospital ER if you have any chest pain , increased
shortness of breath or oxygen requirement , dizziness , lightheadedness ,
fainting , or any other concerns. If you have palpitations or a
sensation of a racing heart , please call your primary care doctor.
Please go to Dr. Patricio &apos; office on Monday for coumadin levels.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check INR levels and adjust coumadin dose as appropriate.
2. Adjust CCB and BBlocker dosing regimen to maintain heart rate and
blood pressure control as appropriate.

3 ) HYPERTENSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year-old woman
followed by Dr. Haggard in the IWAKE HEALTHCARE
Clinic for problems related to obesity , depression and poorly
controlled hypertension. In February of 1994 , she complained of
right breast tenderness with a palpable nodule. A mammogram at
that time revealed mildly dense parenchyma and no calcium and an
ultrasound revealed 4 mm hypoechoic nodule compatible duct
obstruction with debris. Her symptoms of right breast tenderness
waxed and waned and follow-up ultrasound in April of 1994
revealed a 1 X 0.5 cm mass unchanged from the previous ultrasound.
She was advise to return in three months for repeat ultrasound and
aspiration. In October of 1995 , she had a palpable indurated area at
12:00 on the right breast. She was seen by Dr. Noguchi in the
Surgery Clinic and scheduled for a right breast biopsy , but because
of persistent hypertension as an outpatient , she is now admitted
for blood pressure control prior to the breast biopsy on August ,
1995.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for 1 ) Hypertension , 2 ) Obesity ,
3 ) Tobacco use , 4 ) Depression , 5 ) Uterine
leiomyoma , 6 ) Polymyalgia rheumatica.

disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese woman in no apparent
distress. Vital signs: Blood pressure
170/110 , heart rate 80. Her pupils equal , round and reactive to
light. Discs are sharp and there are narrowed vessels on
fundoscopic examination. She has no lymphadenopathy and no bruits.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her right breast shows
indurated 2 X 3 cm mass just above the right nipple , with an
overlying erythema which is moderately tender. Her cardiac
examination reveals a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm
with a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
left upper sternal border. Her abdomen is obese with a midline
scar , positive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly. Her
extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and she has
diminished peripheral pulses. Her neurological examination is
grossly intact.
LABORATORY: On admission , her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm
without any ischemic changes , unchanged from EKG in
September of 1992.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical
Service and given more aggressive hypertensive
medications including increasing her ACE inhibitor to Lisinopril 40
mg p.o. q. day and discontinuing her Diltiazem and started on
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. daily and starting Beta blocker
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.i.d. and increasing as tolerated according

IDENTIFICATION: This is a 58-year-old gentleman admitted for an
EPS study.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old white male
status post aortic root homograft in
1995 for aortic insufficiency secondary to a bicuspid aorta. The
patient was doing very well. He was followed biannually by Dr.
Fleek Recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
65% with the graft intact. The patient noted several episodes of
light-headedness over the last several weeks. Most recently while
playing tennis he collapsed; however , denied loss of consciousness.
He denied palpitations. The patient was seen today in Dr.
Kaffka clinic where he had a ETT test which was stopped
secondary to runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Polio in 1955 , aortic valve root homograft
in 1999.
MEDICATIONS: Cardizem CD 240 milligrams q.d. , Vasotec 5 milligrams
b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco and alcohol. He is married with
two children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for arrhythmias.
ALLERGIES: None.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.9 , heart rate 87 , blood
pressure 146/96 , saturating at 96% on room
air. In general , obese male in no acute distress. HEENT: Moist
mucous membranes. There is a left facial droop with decreased
muscle tone. Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , obese. Normal bowel sounds. Extremities: No
edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented times three. Cranial
nerves II-XII grossly intact.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. QT intervals normal.
LABORATORY: Sodium 141 , creatinine 1.0 , white count 8.6 , platelet
count 186 , 000. His echocardiogram in October 1999
showed an ejection fraction of 65% , normal homograft function. His
Holter monitor showed sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs and some
couplets. His ETT done in clinic showed he did eight minutes and
33 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol. He had three beats of
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , asymptomatic. Peak heart rate
was 150 , peak blood pressure 182 systolic.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service. His hypertensive medications were
continued. The patient had a repeat echocardiogram confirming that
he had normal valve function. The patient&apos;s echocardiogram showed
an ejection fraction around 50% which revealed AI , no valve
dysfunction. His QT interval remained normal on his EKG. The
patient underwent both a left heart catheterization to rule out
significant coronary artery disease as well as an EP study on
10/21/99. The patient&apos;s catheterization showed normal vessels ,
ejection fraction of 55%. His EP study showed normal AV function ,
no inducible SVT. Repeated , new runs of nonsustained monomorphic
as well as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , some observed on
the ETT test. The recommendations were to start a betablocker and
place an ICD. On June , 1999 , the patient had an ICD placed
without any complications. The patient remained asymptomatic
during his hospital stay. He had no episodes of syncope.
The patient was discharged on May , 1999 in stable condition
with instructions to return to the Emergency Room if he felt his
heart racing as well as to avoid strong magnetic fields and to
maintain a low level of activity until after he sees his physician
for follow up. He has a follow up appointment with Dr. Wear
as well as to follow up with the EP service with Dr. Whetsel within
one month.

HOSPITAL COURSE
OVERVIEW: 67M with non occlusive CAD on cath 4/8 who presented with s/s
L and R heart failure and troponin leak attrubuted to CHF. ECHO this
admission showed EF 15-20%. Diuresed 3 kg , started on CHF medical

CV:
ISCH:Ruled out for MI , troponin leak attributed to CHF , however given
low EF &lt;15% ( 30% in 1999 ) and new LBBB went for LHC 1/27 to evaluate for
ischemic CMP which showed no epicardial disease.
PUMP:fluid OL on admission. Felt much better after 3 kg diuresis , RHC on

LBBB. Had 4-6 beat runs of WCT on tele.
HEME: HCT stable post cath
ENDO: per pt had diagnosis of DM2 x2 years , not clear if on treatment ,
though patient thinks he is on something at home. FSG here on ADA diet
were 100-120 in AM and pre-lunch , pre-dinner 170-190. Suggested diet ,
exercise and metformin 500 qd. However , he will see his PCP who will
likely address this issue as his fingersticks have him elevated while in

ATTENDING: ZAPPA , QUINTON VALENTINE MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Bacteremia , hypotension , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chills/hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Purter is a pleasant
69-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD , PVD , diabetes who
presents with 3 days of feeling poorly. He initially had lower
abdominal pain 4/10/2007. He went to see his primary care
doctor on 7/26/2007 where labs were drawn. He had one episode
of emesis ( watery and nonbilious ). On the day of admission , he
woke up with chills and called his PCP who recommended he go to
the ED for further evaluations.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for a poor appetite. He denied
any shortness of breath , cough , current abdominal pain , diarrhea ,
or dysuria. In the ED his temperature was 104.8 , his blood
pressure was 70/45 , with heart rate in the 120s. His exam was
also remarkable for altered mental status with confusion
regarding dates and requiring frequent reorientation. A central
line was placed and he was given vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl prior to transfer to the MICU for further care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes type 2 which has
been diet controlled , hypercholesterolemia , coronary artery
disease status post 4 vessel CABG in 2004 , EF of 35% ( per echo in
2004 ) , history of A-Fib on chronic Coumadin , a history of
peripheral vascular disease status post left popliteal bypass ,
bilateral ankle grafts , gallstones on right upper quadrant
ultrasound in 2/27
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin , atenolol , lisinopril , Lasix ,
Zocor , digoxin , Cilostazol , multivitamins , Protonix , K-Dur ,
Ambien , lorazepam , and Coumadin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives , Norvasc , Plavix ( GI upset ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission on transfer to floor after
MICU stabilization , temperature 97.9 , heart rate 99 , blood
pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 20 , sating 100% on 2 liters. In
general , he was awake and alert , and appropriately answering
questions. His HEENT exam was notable for upper dentures.
Otherwise , his oropharynx was clear. His neck was supple , a
right IJ was in place. He had no bruits. His lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate was tachycardic ,
irregularly irregular , without any murmurs. His abdomen was
soft , nontender , nondistended , with good bowel sounds with no
hepatosplenomegaly and a negative Murphy&apos;s sign. His extremities
had no edema. There were trace DP pulses. His bilateral
extremities were cool. His neuro exam , he was alert and oriented
x3. He was moving all extremities and his cranial nerves were
intact.
STUDIES/PROCEDURES:
Surgery: A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted and
failed. &quot;White bile&quot; drained from his gallbladder , his liver was
very friable. The surgeons aborted the procedure and recommended
medical therapy.
CT of Abdomen/Pelvis: Demonstrated ascending/transverse colitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cholecystitis/Bacteremia: The patient presented with septic
physiology with the source thought to be acute cholecystitis. He
was brought to the OR for laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was
aborted due to his liver disease causing his friable liver and
his high operative risk. The surgical team recommended medical
therapy. He improved markedly on Cipro/Flagyl and is planned for
a 2-week course at discharge. Due to his liver disease ,
hepatitis serologies were checked which did not reveal ongoing
infection. It is recommended that he follow up with a
gastroenterologist for further workup.
2. Cardiovascular ( Ischemia ): Mr. Budhu has a history of
CAD status post CABG with an episode of hypotension/sepsis. In
this setting , he had an NSTEMI with troponin peaking at 0.95. He
is continued on his aspirin and his statin.
3. Cardiovascular ( Pump ): Given his septic presentation , his
antihypertensives were initially held. They were restarted 3
days prior to discharge , and Mr. Caccia had pressures in the
90s but was asymptomatic with these pressures. It was thought
that he was clinically dry. So , Lasix was held at discharge with
the plan to restart them with any weight gain ( the patient weighs
himself daily ) , shortness of breath as advised by his cardiac
nurse ( who will see early on the week of discharge ).
4. Cardiovascular ( Rhythm ): Mr. Cano has a history of
A-Fib on Coumadin , digoxin , and atenolol at home. He will be
discharged on Coumadin/digoxin/Lopressor given his marginal blood
pressures with low-dose beta blockade.
5. Heme: The patient&apos;s INR increased to 3.9 at the time of
discharge ( likely secondary to Cipro and Coumadin interaction ).
This was discussed with the patient&apos;s Dalethom Nym. Hospital anticoagulation
nurse and plans were made to hold Coumadin for 3 days&apos; time and
recheck it on 11/23/2007.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , ciprofloxacin 250 mg
every 12 hours , digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. twice
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg at bedtime , Maalox p.r.n. upset stomach ,
Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. , omeprazole 40 mg
b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Zocor 40 mg nightly ,
multivitamin one tablet daily.

Discharge Date: 3/30/1995
DIAGNOSIS: MORBID OBESITY
PROCEDURE: Panniculectomy
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 42 year old female nurse
chronically obese , whose last weight
two weeks ago was 430 pounds , after a loss of 90 pounds since
February The patient&apos;s mobility is limited to short walks around
the house and she has had some shortness of breath with exertion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for a congenital heart murmur
with major depression , diagnosed in 1990;
duodenal ulcer in 1972; diabetes mellitus , type II , diagnosed in
1995; status post laparotomy in 1974.
MEDICATIONS: Paxil , 60 mg P O q AM; Diabeta , 5 mg P O q AM;
Trazadone , 100 mg q h.s.; Ultram , 100 mg q 4-6 hours
prn; Reglan , 10 mg q 6 hours prn nausea; Bactroban ointment b.i.d.;
Lotrisone cream b.i.d. topically; Afrin nasal spray q 12 hours PRN;
Proventil inhalers , two puffs PRN.
ALLERGIES: To Penicillin , which produces a rash; Corticosteroids
Phenothiazine and aspirin.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs on admission , temperature 99 , pulse 80 ,
respirations 20 , blood pressure 102/70; height 4
feet , 11 inches; weight 430 pounds. Physical exam in general - this
is a massively obese woman lying down in no apparent distress. Her
skin is warm and dry. Her HEENT is benign. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart - normal S1 , normal S2 and a
regular rate and rhythm and without any appreciable murmur at this
time. Abdomen - morbidly obese , with a pannus hanging down to
below the knee level , it is soft , non tender and with difficulty
auscultating bowel sounds. Neurologically , she is alert and
oriented x 3 with no focal deficits. Extremities - she is able to
stand on her feet with no motor or sensory deficits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/1/95 with concern
for her being at high risk of skin breakdown and
infection. Plans were made for panniculectomy , however , prior to
this procedure , she was admitted for IV Ancef t.i.d.; Hibiclenz
showers and sub-q Heparin. Preoperatively , her pulmonary function
was assessed and found to have an FEV-1 of 53% of predicted; FVC of
57% of predicted and an FEV-1/FVC of 93% of predicted. Chest x-ray
showed no active cardiopulmonary disease and an EKG showed a normal
sinus rhythm with a non specific T wave abnormality without change
since 1994. Her hematocrit preoperatively was 39.8 and her white
count was 9. A pulmonary consultation was also obtained because of
concern about her pulmonary status for the operation. On their
recommendation , the patient was treated with Azmacort inhalers ,
Albuterol nebulizer , and aggressive chest PT. On 8/10/95 , the
patient was taken to the operating room where a panniculectomy was
performed by Dr. Stanczyk , without any complications.
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the Co Wauhendprings Ton ICU , where
she continued to be intubated and on ventilatory support. On
postoperative day one , the patient was successfully extubated in
the morning , had 100% saturation on 40% face mask and she was
mobilized early with aggressive chest PT and deep breathing
encouragement stopped. The patient received two ( 2 ) units of
autologous red blood cells; after which her hematocrit was 32%.
Postoperative day two , the patient was found to have a hematocrit
down to 25.2 , likely due to re-equilibration and over the next two
days received two ( 2 ) units of blood with a hematocrit reaching
29%. Though she complained of light headiness prior to the
transfusion , afterwards she was up and walking without difficulty.
From postoperative day two , the patient was saturating at greater
than 93% on room air; had a wound that was clean and dry and intact
with serosanguineous drainage in the Jackson-Pratt drains and
showed no evidence of cellulitis , purulent drainage or fever , on IV
Ancef. On postoperative day five , two of the four Jackson-Pratt
drains were removed after their output fell below 30 ccs per day
and the patient was discharged in good condition on postoperative
day six with plans for home visiting nurse for dressing changes
daily and P O Keflex while two Jackson-Pratt drains were in. The
patient will be following up in outpatient clinic with Dr. Bartles
in one ( 1 ) week.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Keflex , 500 mg P O q.i.d.; 2 ) Percocet

ATTENDING: EMILIO R. WAX MD , PHD
ATTENDING: Shawn Korzenski , M.D.
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Non-ST elevation MI.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: Thromboembolic coronary artery occlusion ,
rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve replacement , aortic valve
replacement with St. Jude&apos;s valve , status post tricuspid repair ,
CHF , type II diabetes , atrial fibrillation , esophageal ulcer ,
osteoporosis.
In brief , Ms. Bernotas is a 63-year-old Hindi speaking woman with
CAD , rheumatic heart disease , status post mitral valve
replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , diabetes type II ,
history of subacute bacterial endocarditis transferred from
Digua Leahem Valley with a troponin of 64. She had presented with
several days of neck and back pain and some vague mild left sided
chest pain. No shortness of breath and diaphoresis. No cough.
At Virg Seum Medical Center , EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with
some 1-2 mm depressions in V2 through V5. There was a question
of dig effect. Her chest x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe
infiltrate and patient was given aspirin , Lovenox and transferred
to DNMH for catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD , rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve
replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , SBE , diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient presented again with a non-ST
elevation MI with elevated troponin. The patient had had a
negative catheterization just two years ago and it was unclear
whether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronary
artery disease or from another source such as pericarditis or
erosion from endocarditis into her myocardium. Also , given the
back pain , there was a concern for aortic dissection and a chest
CT was done on 8/4/04 which showed no aortic dissection. She
was continued on heparin , Plavix , aspirin , and beta-blocker and
will be restarted on her ACE inhibitor , was not restarted in
hospital , by her PCP. Given her continued neck pain with endemic
ST changes which included depressions in V2 through V5 , and her
substantial elevation in her troponin I to a peak of 64 , a
catheterization was done that demonstrated thrombosis on OM2 at
the ostia which was thought to be embolic. All her other
coronary arteries appeared normal , so this 100% lesion was
angioplastied to 50% residual. Post procedure course was
complicated by pulmonary edema with rising O2 requirement. She
diuresed well with improvement to room air , satting 100%. She
again had neck pain in V2 through V5 depressions on 6/17 , just
three days after the catheterization on 3/25 This was
medically managed because the dynamic changes did not return and
thought to be left over plaque from the last lesion. The patient
had been stable for about one week before discharge without any
complaints of neck pain whatsoever and her troponins had trended
down significantly during this event. The patient had not
complained of any symptoms while walking.
Pump-wise , her echo showed an EF of 60% with preserved LV and RV
function. Her old RVSP increased roughly to 65 , possible
increase in mitral gradient. The patient had had RVSP before and
it had been increased at roughly to 55 mmHg. Possible increase
in mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough to
evaluate given her artificial valve. The patient then had a TEE
which was negative for vegetation or thrombus. It was thought
that the thrombus she had already thrown to her OM2 would most
likely be the thrombus that she had had and there was none left
on the valves. For that reason , patient was volume overloaded
and was diuresed on torsemide 100 PO b.i.d. which seems to be a
good regimen for her as far as her dry weights seem to be around
50 kilos , maybe even 48 kilos , and she should have daily weights
checked.
Rhythm-wise , the patient had A. fib. She was on tele and no
events and she is being anticoagulated both for her valve and for
her A. fib.
ID-wise , she had increased white blood cell count and a left
shift with one band , the right lower lobe infiltrate and
completed a 7-day course of levo. Was afebrile throughout the
hospitalization and had negative blood cultures , and again the
negative TEE.
Heme-wise , her INR goal is now 3 to 4 , ideally 3 to 3.5 , and this
is essential. Patient will follow up with the Coumadin Clinic.
Her INR was 5.3 on 1/4/04. She was treated on 3/25/04. She
had an INR of ??__?? She is to be drawn by the VNA the next day ,
11/4/04 , and they should call Coumadin Clinic with the result.
Given high INR , we held the Coumadin on 10/20 and restarted dose
on 6/26 at a dose of 3 q.p.m.
Respiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumed
pneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. She did
complain sometimes of subjective shortness of breath , but her
oxygen saturation remained at 100% throughout the rest of the
hospitalization besides after the cath.
GI-wise , she is stable. She got some simethicone for gas and a
bowel regimen. She was doing well , but given her continued pain ,
GI and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesenteric
ischemia. A CT angiogram of the abdomen was performed with
negative workup for mesenteric ischemia. They thought that most
of her discomfort was due to constipation.
FEN-wise , we replaced her lytes. Also we put her on carnitine
for diet supplementation.
Renal-wise , the patient had increase in creatinine secondary to
the dye load from the cath and both her CT scans. The creatinine
was .9 on day of discharge. We held off on starting the ACE
because of this , but she should consider getting an ACE to add to
her regimen given her diabetes and recent MI. That should be
started as an outpatient.
Endocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. She had
sugars ranging from 40 to 400. We changed her regimen to Lantus
26 units q.p.m. along with novalog pre-meal with 16 before
breakfast and 8 of novalog before lunch and 8 of novalog before
dinner. Her sugars improved greatly , all in the 100s. She had
severe osteoporosis as well and vitamin C deficiency. Consider
starting Zometa as an outpatient per primary care doctor , Dr.
Cuaresma Prophylaxis with heparin and Nexium.
DISPO: She refused rehab and wanted to go home with services and
she should get home PT and a home VNA. She is full code.
PLAN: Follow up with the Coumadin Clinic and get her blood drawn
every 2-3 days. The VNA should call 107-568-5779 with the
results of her INR. In addition , her goal again is to have an
INR of 3-4. She should follow up with Dr. Waley , her
cardiologist , in 1-2 weeks and Dr. Jason Sorto will come to
see her on 3/2 , 11:30 a.m. at her house. I also recommended
that patient not add salt to her diet and not drink fluids
greater than one liter per day and also check her daily weights.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been admitted to the hospital with chest pain. Your chest pain
is likely due to a combination of your coronary artery disease and
anxiety. You did not have a heart attack. Rather this appears to be
stable angina and your current medication regimen is maximized for this
treatment. You also developed a fast heart rhythm called atrial flutter
when you were admitted , but your heart returned to normal rhythm on its
own. Thus , no medications are being started for this. As an
outpatient you will get an ECHO and also some heart monitoring that
will be arranged by Dr. Sapper You will be called with the times for
this. You should continue the same medications that you were previously
taking. If you develop light-headedness , chest pain , or shortness of
breath , you should call your doctor.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
*PCP - patient will need ECHO and Cardiac Monitoring as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 6/18/2006
ATTENDING: RAMINEZ , ISRAEL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Weakness , shortness of breath , and dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 48-year-old female who was discharged to home on
1/25/06 from Nixma County Hospital after an ICU admission for
pneumonia and Klonopin overdose. Two days prior to admission
here , she experienced shortness of breath at rest and some
lightheadedness. At baseline , she becomes dyspneic after walking
20 feet secondary to obesity and many years of smoking. She also
notes several days of headache and some questionable darkening in
her visual fields bilaterally. She admits that her p.o. intake
has been rather poor since coming home secondary to anorexia and
that she has felt dehydrated. On review of systems , she also
notes chronic waxing and waning erythema of the right lower
extremity which in recent days has worsened with accompanying
swelling and mild tenderness , although her son says that it has
been worse in the past. Also , she has noted loose stools since
8/4/06. She denies chest pain , pleurisy , abdominal pain , blood
in her stool or urine , dysuria , change in frequency , character or
urination , or focal weakness. No new medications other than a
recent antibiotic course at Dale Skin Sonmu Medical Center completed there for
pneumonia. She has not taken her lisinopril or methadone in the
last two days. She has no sick contact. She saw her PCP on
2/8/06 who found her to be hypotensive and hypoxic and then
sent her to Ma County Hospital ED. Her family is not clear on her
discharge diagnosis , but they report that her kidney function was
abnormal and she was dehydrated. She was not admitted. She then
came to the ED at Town Medical Center And Clinics for persistent shortness of
breath and dizziness. In the ED , her vital signs were that she
was afebrile , her systolic blood pressure was in the high 60&apos;s ,
her heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate in the 30&apos;s , and O2
saturations were in the high 80&apos;s. She was given vancomycin ,
Levaquin and gentamicin and 3 liters of normal saline. She was
aggressively given fluids and was started on Levophed for blood
pressure support. Her EKG was notable for low voltage on
precordial leads and borderline right axis deviation. Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly , but otherwise clear. In the MICU , her
blood pressure was stabilized on Levophed , but she was also noted
to drop her blood pressure to the 70&apos;s when initiated on her home
BiPAP settings.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
She had endocarditis 20 years ago. She has obstructive sleep
apnea , on her home BiPAP , morbid obesity , and hypertension. She
had a right ankle injury more than 20 years ago during the motor
vehicle accident , which was complicated by an ankle infection.
She has chronic right lower extremity pain and she is on
methadone. She had a Klonopin overdose. She had Enterobacter
pneumonia. She was treated with cefepime at that time ,
questionable the vancomycin. She has a questionable diagnosis of
COPD with her extensive smoking history. In a well state , her
PCO2 was 49 , her O2 saturation is 89% , and she has also history
of depression.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Lisinopril and methadone. She is not taking her lisinopril. She
has in the past taken lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide.
ALLERGIES:
She is allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She smoked half a pack a day for 30 years. No alcohol for three
years. No illicit drugs. She lives at home , but does not work.
She is on disability.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was afebrile , heart rate in the 100&apos;s , blood pressure 130/80 ,
respiratory of 18 , and O2 saturation 95% on 8 liters of oxygen.
She was awake and alert and in no acute distress. She is
anicteric , without pallor. She had a thick neck. Pulmonary:
She had decreased breath sounds and crackles at the bases
bilaterally. Cardiovascular: She was tachy , regular , but
distant S4. JVP was difficulty to ascertain secondary to neck
habitus. Her abdomen was obese , + bowel sounds , nontender and
nondistended. Extremities were without erythema of her legs , but
with mild swelling of the right lower ankle. The ankles were
without swelling and with full range of motion. Neurologically ,
she was alert and oriented , but unfocused in conversation , moving
all her extremities. Her strength was intact.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
Please see LMR.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 49-year-old woman with a recent ICU stay at an outside
hospital who presented with hypotension , tachycardia , and acute
renal failure. Presentation was most consistent with right
pulmonary embolus and right ventricular failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary/Vascular: There was initial concern for a PE given
the presentation of severe hypotension , tachycardia , and Aa
gradient without evidence of infection or primary cardiac
disease. An echo showed a dilated RV with depressed RV function
suggestive of PE. Her initial PE scan was nondiagnostic
secondary to poorly timed contrast and motion of the patient. A
VQ scan showed intermediate probability. She was started on
heparin drip with a goal of 60 to 80. Her second PECT showed a
small PE to the right upper lobe , but it was not large enough to
explain her dramatic presentation. The working hypothesis is
that there was a significant recanalization prior to this repeat
CT which took place two days after the first CT. She was
initially on oxygen in the ICU. She was never intubated. She
was on face mask , and upon transfer to the floor , she was on
nasal cannula 4 liters. Her O2 saturations were acceptable
in-house , although she did desaturate to 90% when she took her
oxygen off a night. She multiple times refused BiPAP while in
the hospital , but she will go back on it when she returns home.
2. Cardiovascular: She had a mild troponin elevation on
admission , likely secondary to RV strain. She had severe
hypotension and was on two pressors. She was weaned off of these
on 3/9/06 , but did have an episode of hypotension when her
BiPAP was started. She was given a little bit of low dose
dobutamine and then she was weaned off of that on 10/4/06.
Rhythm: She has no active issues. We continued to hold her
lisinopril while in-house. Her blood pressures were stable , but
not high enough to withstand on additional blood pressure
lowering medication. It was discussed with her PCP that she
perhaps will need this medication restarted as an outpatient.
She does have a history of severe hypertension.
3. Renal: As she was in acute failure on admission with a
creatinine of 6.9 , it dropped to 0.5 , most likely this was due to
prerenal azotemia and decreased renal perfusion in the setting of
hypotension. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys in setting of
hypovolemia and right heart failure resulting in decreased left
ventricular preload. Mucomyst and bicarb were given prior to the
PECTs of her renal protection. She did not develop any
additional contrast nephropathy after her CT scans. Her
creatinine on discharge was 0.6.
4. Endocrine: She had a normal increase in her cortisol level
with ACTH stimulation. Her fingersticks were monitored while she
was in-house and she never had any need for supplemental insulin.
5. FEN: She was on a house diet.
6. ID: She was empirically covered on admission with
vancomycin , levofloxacin and gentamicin. Her antibiotics were
given again on 10/8/06 and on 2/8/06. There was no evidence
of an infection found , no fever , normal white count , with a
normal differential , normal UA , chest x-ray is without
infiltrate , and antibiotics were discontinued on 2/5/06. She
continued to remain afebrile in-house without any evidence of
infection.
7. Urology: She did complain of bladder spasms while having the
Foley in place. She was started on Ditropan. She had multiple
negative urinalysis and urine cultures. Once the Foley was
discontinued , she was able to void and she stopped having bladder
spasms. She was started on Monistat for a yeast infection.
8. Allergy: She did have an elevated eosinophilia on
presentation and it was 4% on admission and increased to 8% on
2/5/06. On the day of discharge , it was 7.5. There is no
clinical evidence of allergy , rheumatic disease or parasitic
infection. Her obstructive lung disease may be of an asthma
variant , and there is the possibility she may need inhaled
corticosteroids as an outpatient.
9. Heme: She was on unfractionated heparin for her presumed PE
until 2/5/06 and then she was changed to Lovenox in the morning
of that day on 120 mg subq. Her weight at that time was 157 kg.
Her Coumadin , her initially given 10 , then a dose of 5 and then 2
dose of 7.5. Her INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at
2.5. She will continue on the Lovenox for two additional days.
Her INR will be monitored by Dr. Kid , her PCP.
10. Psych/Addiction: We are continuing her methadone. It has
been switched from 20 mg p.o. daily to 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. She was
also given a little bit of Ativan while in-house to help with her
agitation and anxiety. She was initially given a little bit of
Haldol , but that was discontinued on 1/29/06 and there was no
additional need for that. She did have a central line placed on
10/18/06 , which was discontinued on 2/5/06 without any evidence
of any line infection and without any problems. She was seen by
Social Work and PT. The patient refused to go to any sort of
rehab or nursing home. It was decided that the patient would
return home with skilled nursing and with PT as needed.

Imp: 74 yo woman with pulmonary sarcoid and CHF and CRI here with SOB
after stopping lasix several weeks ago. Given clinical exam and CXR it
appears that she is in decompensated CHF , and in worse renal failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) Cardiovascular: She was in mildly decompensated CHF , and was started
on more aggressive diuresis , starting with lasix 40 iv BID increased to 80
bid on HD2 as she was not meeting her diuresis goal. With cardiology
service consulting , she was increase to lasix drip at 15/hr on HD3 , with
i/o goal 1-2 l neg. She did well on this and by HD5 was near her dry
weight of 49kg and her drip was transitioned back to PO lasix. She is no
on lasix 80 po bid , which is felt to be adequate to maintain her dry
weight. She was continued on Hydralazine , lopressol and was restarted on
Isordil on HD3 , titrated up to 20 tid. She has history of MI with
stents and was continued on Asa , Plavix , Zocor. He cardiac enzymes were
negative. Her BNP fell from 3500 on admit to 1500 at her dry wt on HD6.
She was paced intermittent ( pacer placed in past for sick sinus ,
functioning properly at a backup rate of 50 ).
2 ) Renal: She presented with acute on chronic RF possibly due to poor for
forward flow in the setting of CHF decompensation. Cr up to 3.6 on
HD3 , but as she diuresed , her Cr stabilized. Renal consult was following
and recommended diureses , low K diet , good glucose control , and
withholding ace inhibitor. She is discharge at her dry weight with a Cr
stable at 3.5. She should probably not go on Ace Inhibitor again.
3 ) FEN- Hyperkalemia w/o EKG change. Improved w/ lasix. Rec&apos;d Kayexylate
in ED. Now improved. Follow K/Mg. She should not be on an Ace inhibitor
or a K-sparing diuretic.
4 ) ENDO- glipizide at home which was restarted on HD5. Add insulin SS for
tight control. TSH high. T4 low. This should be rechecked as an outpt
before initiating therapy.
5 ) Heme- ON coumadin for history DVT. Held on HD3 for an INR
3.1 and was restarted shortly after , but her INR is 1.4. She
received 1.5 U of PRBC for goal HCT &gt;30 and is currently 30.8. Her
anemia is 2/2 chronic renal disease and she was started on
darbopoetin 25 qwk. She developed a clot in her Right external
jugular ( site of prior IV ) and was place on renal dose of lovenox
until her INR&gt;2. Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is &gt;2.
6 ) Neuro- On dilantin for history of partial seizures.
7 ) Code- no CPR if sudden death , but intubation/defibrillation ok in the
setting of instability.
Dispo: She was discharged to Wadesdi Ckgart Community Hospital at a euvolemic state with a dry
weight of 49kg. She should continue on 80 po lasix bid unless her Cr rises
above new baseline of 3.5 or if she gains weight or shows signs of new
overload. Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is &gt; 2. Coumadin dose
should be adjusted according to INR goal 2-3. She should be on a renal
diet with low potassium and low glucose but with diabetic caloric
supplements like GLUCERNA. She should receive a HOT PACK to her neck 2-3x
per day and to her vein before blood draw for comfort.
She should receive physical therapy daily with the goal of gait stability ,
home safety , and good O2 sats on 2L O2. She should go home with home O2 at
2L and with VNA services for meds. She lives at home alone and it would be
ideal if she had a relative stay with her for a few days to a week after
going home.
resume VNA services upon dc.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Afebrile. Blood pressure 106/60. Pulse 61. Respirations 20.
Oxygen saturation 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula. General exam
shows elderly female in no acute distress , on 2 liters nasal
cannula. HEENT exam shows moist mucus membranes , no
lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam shows 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the left lower sternal border. Regular rate. No
murmurs or gallops. JVP at 9 cm. Pulmonary exam shows crackles
bilateral lower one-half. Abdominal exam shows obese abdomen ,
nontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities
show 2+ pulses distally and 1+ edema to the knees.
ADMISSION LABS:
Pertinent for sodium of 131 , glucose of 232 , a CK of 327 , CK-MB
of 10.5 , and a troponin less than assay. Urinalysis was
pertinent for 3+ protein , 2+ blood , 2+ leucocytes , and negative
nitrites. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 with
left atrial enlargement but unchanged otherwise. Chest x-ray on
admission showed pulmonary edema.
PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization 11/9/05 ; no interval change since last
catheterization. 100% LAD , 100% left circumflex , 20% RCA
stenosis , LIMA graft to the LAD , patent SVG to D1. Disease was
not amenable to intervention. Please see catheter report for
further details.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: Initial troponin was negative. No EKG changes but on
the second set of cardiac enzymes , the troponin was elevated to
0.82. The patient was sent to Cath Lab for NSTEMI on 11/9/05 ,
with no interval change on cath noted and no intervention
performed. Troponins trended down thereafter less than assay.
The patient did have an episode of chest pain on 8/18/05 in the
setting of systolic blood pressure of 200 without EKG changes
currently. After assessing source of troponin leak on admission ,
but positively secondary to demand in the setting of hypertension
and acute/pulmonary edema. We will continue beta-blocker , ACE
inhibitor , statin , Imdur , Plavix and aspirin as an outpatient.
Pump: EF preserved on cath. Volume overloaded on admission
likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema secondary to
hypertension , diastolic dysfunction. The patient was diuresed
well on 40 mg of Lasix p.o. during her stay with the team on an
outpatient maintenance dose of Lasix 60 mg daily. The patient
was euvolemic on discharge. The blood pressures were labile
initially but better controlled with amlodipine and an increased
dose of captopril. Will continue as an outpatient on
beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , calcium channel blocker.
Rhythm: Intermittent brachycardia to the high 30s , but always
asymptomatic. Lopressor dose was decreased from t.i.d. to b.i.d.
during her stay. She will continue on home dose of Toprol XL 25
mg p.o. daily.
Pulmonary: Status post acute shortness of breath episode prior to
admission requiring initially nonrebreather and nasal cannula
thereafter , which markedly improved with diuresis. The patient
was stable on room air at the time of discharge.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on her home insulin regimen
along with sliding scale , and she will be discharged on home
insulin regimen.
ID: The patient was noted to have a urinalysis consistent with
urinary tract infections and completed a 7-day course of
ciprofloxacin for complicating TI.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged in stable condition to rehab as an
outpatient.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
Temperature 98 degrees , blood pressure 122/55 , heart rate 55 , O2
saturation 93-95% on room air. General exam shows an elderly
female , resting , no acute distress , alert and oriented.
Cardiovascular: Shows regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. JVP at 8 cm.
Upon re-exam , shows bibasilar crackles. Abdominal exam shows
soft , abdomen that is nontender , nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds and extremity exam shows +1 edema to the calves.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. Andreas Hasson She will be
contacted in regard to the appointment date. She was instructed
to call Dr. Colvin if she notes a weight gain of 2 pounds at any
given day or a 5-pound weight gain in a week.

presented with extensive PE. She was extremely SOB and c/o pleuritic
chest pain. Her ekg and exam were not suggestive of cardiac
dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with Heparin. However , her platelets were noted to drop
from 237 to 93. HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued. The
patient was started on Fondaparinux. A PF4 Antibody was sent and pending
at the time of discharge. Coumadin was started after one day of
Fondaparinux with an intent to bridge over at least 5 days with a goal
INR of 2-3. The patient&apos;s blood pressure was decreased over the course of
her admission. All antihypertensives were held. She may be preload
dependent in the setting of an acute PE. During her admission an
echocardiogram was performed. It did not show evidence of right heart
strain or LV dysfunction. Her EF was 65-70%. Over the course of the
hospitalzation , the patient&apos;s symptoms improved dramatically. Her oxygen
requirement decreased. Her vital signs remained stable.

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity , coronary artery disease ,
hypercholesterolemia , and diabetes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old obese female
with coronary disease and a focus of adenocarcinoma in
endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. She presents for
operative management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary disease with a
cardiac catheterization performed in October 2004 showing 100%
occlusion of the LAD. A concurrent echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 70%. Other past medical history is
significant diet-controlled type 2 diabetes , hypertension , and
sleep apnea.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: D&amp;C and cardiac catheterization.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol , lisinopril , Lipitor , Zyrtec ,
Singulair , and aspirin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent an
uncomplicated TAHBSO with minimal blood loss. At 8 p.m. on
postoperative day 0 , she developed a temperature of 102 and
repeat 101.3. Exam was nonfocal. A CBC showed white count of
12.9 with 7% bands , UA suggestive of UTI. She was started on
levofloxacin. On postoperative day #1 , she was again febrile to
102 and cultures were sent. On postoperative day #2 , there was
no growth on her cultures. Her T-max was 100.7 and she was
observed for an additional 24 hours for fever. On postoperative
day #3 , she was afebrile. She had been afebrile all day and she
was discharged to rehab on postoperative day #4 in stable
condition , tolerating p.o.&apos;s , voiding spontaneously , passing gas ,
with pain control with p.o. pain medications. Rehabilitation
placement was obtained because she had significant difficulty
ambulating in the setting of her morbid obesity and needed
physical therapy services prior to returning home where she lives
alone.

Discharge Date: 9/27/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old man with
ischemic cardiomyopathy , estimated EF
15-20% who presents with an 8-10 pound weight gain over the past
3-5 days , increased fatigue. Also reports increased shortness of
breath which has progressed over the past few months and notes that
he now gets shortness of breath after walking as few as 10-20
steps. He also complains of lightheadedness but denies chest pain ,
palpitations. He also complains of occasional sweats and chills
without nausea , diarrhea , constipation , melena , or bright red blood
per rectum. He reports that lately his blood sugars have been
lower than usual , in the 40s-80s. Denies orthopnea , PND , or lower
extremity edema. Denies dietary indiscretions or medical
noncompliance. However , there is a recent history of discontinuing
certain medications and the patient is unclear to which medications
he should actually be taking at this point.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in 1979 and 1985 ,
status post three-vessel CABG in 1987 , ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
estimated ejection fraction 15-20% , cardiac cirrhosis ,
hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis , gallstones , irritable bowel
syndrome , psoriasis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Torsemide , Synthroid 100 mcg p.o.q.d.;
Lantus 98 units subcu q. a.m.; potassium
60 mEq p.o. b.i.d.; Humalog insulin 12 units subcu q. a.m. and q.
p.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Xanax p.r.n.; Prozac 40 mg p.o.
q. a.m.; Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d.;
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. Per patient
his digoxin , Captopril and Aldactone have been on hold. Apparently
these were held after a clinic visit on 1/23/02 via Dr. Mcmeans
when the patient was complaining of orthostatic symptoms and his
torsemide was held over the past five days prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.8 , heart rate
72 , blood pressure 91/63 , breathing 95% on
room air. GENERAL: This is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman in
no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP estimated at 12 cm/water. LUNGS: Decreased
breath sounds at bases , otherwise clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No heart
sounds. No murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Warm , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.2 , troponin-I 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 67 beats/minute , first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block. Q
waves in II , III and AVF consistent with old inferior infarct. All
these findings unchanged from the prior EKG in 2/14
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. VOLUME OVERLOAD.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient on admission was
clinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed
with torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two
liters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as
spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status
were difficult to assess and accordingly on 8/12/02 he underwent
right heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his
right atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his
wedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37
indicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On
therapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his
systemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with
success with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was
discontinued on 6/24/02. He has continued to be diuresed with
torsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should
be at or near euvolemia on 11/10/02 and he was discharged on a
diuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone
25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Ischemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital
admission.
Rhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient
was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No
evidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup
was pursued from a rhythm standpoint.
2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is
unclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his
Synthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.
He had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When
he was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,
Dr. Escudero , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and
titrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and
there was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would
precipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some
discussion with Dr. Pimpare his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg
p.o.q.d. On 9/22/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on
7/30/02 his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.
Endocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg
p.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25
mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly
titrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.
Further management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an
outpatient basis.
The patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes
maintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated
downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low
fingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while
in the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.
a.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.
a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards
by his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Wakeham
3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and
during this admission he was maintained on his outpatient
medications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated
upwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He
was discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further
psychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his
inpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.
4 ) Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine was monitored throughout his
hospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No
further renal evaluation or intervention was required during this
hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was discharged on 11/10/02 on e
following medications: spironolactone 25
mg p.o.q.d.; Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; simvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Lantus insulin 60 units
subcu q. a.m.; Humalog insulin 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
K-Dur 40 mEq p.o.q.d.; Synthroid 150 mcg p.o.q.d.; Prozac 60 mg
p.o. q. a.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o.q.d.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , DIABETES MELLITUS ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DEPRESSION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , VOLUME OVERLOAD ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DIABETES MELLITUS , DEPRESSION.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition afebrile on 11/10/02 without
shortness of breath , without chest pain , without any complaints.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with VNA arranged to visit him
on 8/13/02 for the first time to monitor his weight ,
to monitor his electrolytes and to monitor his blood sugars and to
adjust his insulin and diuretic dose as needed.
FOLLOWUP: He was instructed to follow up with Dr. Edwardson in
1-3 weeks and to follow up with his outpatient
endocrinologist , Dr. Adelmund , in 1-2 weeks. Physical therapy was also
arranged for home physical therapy to begin after discharge.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) UNSTABLE ANGINA
( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
( 3 ) DIABETES MELLITUS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old female
with history of coronary artery
disease who presented with unstable angina. The patient&apos;s cardiac
risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , and
post-menopausal. She presented to an outside hospital in 1992 with
substernal chest pain. A cardiac catheterization at that time
revealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate to
severe proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal
1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and a
tight left circumflex. She underwent a PTCA of the left circumflex
artery with improvement. She was well until approximately one year
ago when she began having exertional chest pain. Her chest pain
has been worsening over the past several months and has been
occurring with less and less exertion. She was admitted in July
of 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
An exercise Thallium test was negative. She was well until February
of 1997 when she again developed exertional chest pain. She said
that the chest pain was substernal. It had no radiation and no
nausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. She had an exercise test on
10/15/97 where she was only able to exercise for three minutes and
stopped secondary to shortness of breath. She was scheduled for an
elective catheterization on 9/20/97 but her chest pain has been
slowly worsening over the past couple of months. She reports a
history of exertional chest pain at only one-half block. Normally
her chest pain was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. On
the evening prior to admission she woke up at 3 a.m. with severe
substernal chest pain. She had no relief with three sublingual
nitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room.
In the emergency room she was made pain-free with IV nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as above. Diabetes
mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , and Metformin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room
department with chest pain but became pain-free
with sublingual nitroglycerin. The heparin was started in the
emergency room and the patient was given aspirin. The patient&apos;s
admission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes from
her previous ECG.
During the first several days of admission the patient began
complaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning ,
the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right back
and she was tender to palpation. Examination under the left breast
revealed three to four vesicles on an erythematous base felt to be
consistent with zoster. The patient was therefore started on
Famvir with some improvement of the pain and the lesion. In
addition to the superficial chest pain the patient did have some
chest pain which was felt to be cardiac in origin although she did
not have any ECG changes. She was continued on nitroglycerin and
heparin and her Lopressor was increased as tolerated.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 5/26/97.
Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , the
catheterization showed three vessel disease with normal left
ventricular function. It was felt that the patient needed to go
for coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she had
the herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait to
do the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved.
Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergo
coronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. Prior to discharge
the patient was seen by surgery and anesthesia for her preoperative
workup. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
26 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Lopressor 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q5m times three ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q4h p.r.n.
pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , Famciclovir 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times 7
days. FOLLOWUP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Alexis Iannotti
on 2/20/97 and will follow-up with cardiac surgery.

PROCEDURE:
1. Chest x-ray.
2. Dobutamine MIBI.
3. Echocardiogram.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year-old woman
with a history of hypertension ,
asthma , congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease who
has left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular dysfunction.
She presented to the Bych Hospitals emergency room
department with two weeks of cough and two days of multiple
episodes of emesis and diarrhea. The review of systems was
otherwise negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram in
October of 2000 showed mild to moderate
left ventricular dysfunction , septal apical hypokinesis , and
abnormal septal motion. Coronary artery disease. Dobutamine MIBI
in October of 2000 showed small fixed apical inferior defect , mild
ischemia in the lateral wall. Hypertension. Asthma. Morbid
obesity. Hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS: Atrovent , Flovent , Serevent , Vioxx , Zocor , Lopressor ,
Lasix , Losartan , aspirin , nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES: Lisinopril.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with two daughters and granddaughter.
Never smoked. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
120 , blood pressure 215/91 , respiratory rate
22 , oxygen saturation 93% on room air. The physical examination is
notable for morbid obesity. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA: WBC 7 , hematocrit 45.5 , platelet count 211 , 000.
Chem-7 within normal limits. ECG: No acute
changes. Chest x-ray: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
SUMMARY: This is a 62 year-old woman admitted with two weeks of
dry cough , malaise , and resolving gastrointestinal
symptoms suspicious for a slowly resolving viral infection coupled
with mild congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction while in the hospital. The
patient had multiple nocturnal episodes of bradycardia and second
degree heart block with occasional irregular PR intervals. These
episodes were mostly asymptomatic although she did suffer one
episode of flash pulmonary edema on 1/21/02. Echocardiogram was
done in the hospital which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with
no wall motion abnormalities and mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Dobutamine MIBI was also performed and this showed no
ischemia. The electrophysiology service was consulted and they
determined that the patient was not a candidate for pacing. While
she was in the hospital , the patient enjoyed excellent diuresis on
IV Torsemide and was discharged on p.o. Lasix.
Pulmonary: The patient had a persistent cough which improved with
diuresis and with a five day course of levofloxacin to treat
possible bacterial bronchitis. Nocturnal oxygen saturation monitor
revealed likely obstructive sleep apnea with episodic desaturations
to as low as 57%. These episodes of desaturation were coupled with
second degree AV block as mentioned above. The patient was started
on C-PAP , however , she did not tolerate and refused to use as outpatient.
Gastrointestinal: The patient&apos;s nausea and vomiting resolved
following admission.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS FOR 30 YEARS.
2. HYPERLIPIDEMIA.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
5. STATUS POST RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY STENT PLACEMENT IN THE LEFT

6. TOTAL BLINDNESS X2 YEARS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Carlo Branscomb is a 63 year
old woman with cardiac risk factors
including hypertension , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus x30
years , elevated cholesterol , known coronary artery disease status
post MI , who presented with 1 1/2 hours of chest pain. This chest
pain began at approximately 9:30 a.m. while the patient was
awaiting her ride to the center for the blind , where she spends
most of her mornings and afternoon. The patient began as a dull
ache substernal in location , described as a squeezing sensation
similar to her past angina , but less strong than the angina she had
had last week before coming to the Er, Holeo Hospital Center . The
patient described this as 4/10 chest pain. She also had shortness
of breath , diaphoresis , and wrist tingling on the left. The
patient took one sublingual nitro at home with some relief , but the
pain came back as she walking around her home looking for her
hospital identification care. She had worsening of the pain with
exercise. She sat down and her visiting nurse gave her two more
sublingual nitroglycerin with some relief of pain and called the
ambulance. In the ambulance , the patient continued to have the
pain and she received one more sublingual nitroglycerin and nasal
cannula oxygen. The pain was gone upon arrival to Ahi University Of Medical Center In the Emergency Department , the patient was found to be
afebrile with heart rate in the high 90s , BP 200s/100s. EKG with
questionable changes compared to old , showing normal sinus rhythm
to leftward axis and LVH. For her elevated heart rate and blood
pressure , the patient received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 20 mg of
labetalol in the Emergency Department and was started on heparin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.d.; NPH 25 U subcu. q.a.m.;
Regular insulin 15 U subcu. q.a.m.; captopril 37.5 mg
p.o. t.i.d.; Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d.;
ECASA 325 mg p.o. q.d.; Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was born in Rika Hwy , Scond Pringsi Vi , Missouri 79802 and immigrated to
the Na Lu Clearmode in 1968. The patient formerly
worked as a nurses aide at Nac.c Riversredd Medical Center . The patient lives
with her son and his wife , and their four children. The patient
has never smoked and does not drink.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 73 , BP 93/51 ,
oxygen saturation 98% on room air , and was
afebrile when she arrived on the floor. GENERAL: The patient was
alert and in no acute distress , and as previously noted , the
patient is blind. HEENT: An atrophic right eye with two palpable
recoiled muscles in the upper and lower palpebral margin. Her left
eye is mobile , but has a clouded pupil area. She does not blink to
threat. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. NECK: Her
jugular venous pressure was not elevated. HEART: Regular rate and
rhythm , with audible S1 , S2 , no murmur , rubs , or gallops were
appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft , mildly obese , non-tender ,
non-distended. The patient had audible bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:
No clubbing or cyanosis. She has trace edema in the lower
extremities , good pulses bilaterally in her lower extremities and
in her upper extremities. NEURO: Grossly intact , except for her
visual exam. SKIN: No rashes , warm , and dry.
LABORATORY DATA: Initial labs when the patient arrived included a
normal Chem-7. CBC that was normal , including a
white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 41.3 , platelets 254 , with 52
polys , 33 lymphs , and 0 bands on her differential. Coags - PT
19.9 , INR 0.8. Initial CK 251 , initial troponin 1.26.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Initial questioning of the patient revealed that
she had actually been admitted less than two
weeks earlier with similar syndrome of chest pain , though as the
patient describes , worse two weeks previously. At that point , the
patient had had a modified Bruce protocol with duration of the test
5 minutes 12 seconds , with 63% of heart rate achieved. The patient
had stopped secondary to chest pain and had had ST-T wave segment
abnormalities , with 1 mm ST segment depressions in inferior leads
and angina. The test was interpreted as being highly predictive of
significant coronary disease. However , at that time , the patient
refused catheterization and decided on medical management for this
anginal pain. However , with the return of this pain and her return
admission to the hospital , the patient made the decision that she
would be catheterized and she was placed on this schedule. Other
initial interventions , other than what was done in the Emergency
Room , which included maximizing blood pressure and heart rate
management with Lopressor. The patient was continued on her daily
aspirin and Zocor. The patient was ruled out for a MI. The
patient&apos;s cholesterol and lipids were checked , and an initial
echocardiogram was also obtained on the patient. That echo done on
4/23/99 in the morning revealed overall normal left ventricular
size with preserved systolic function , an estimated ejection
fraction of 60% , and hypokinesis of inferior posterior wall and
septum. The mitral valve was minimally thickened with minimal
mitral regurgitation. There was no significant aortic or tricuspid
valve regurgitation or dysfunction. There was normal right
ventricular size and function. There was no evidence of
pericardial effusion. The left ventricle was thought to be
moderate to severely hypertrophied. However , the inferior
posterior walls were less hypertrophied than other areas. The
patient had one episode of chest pain over the weekend as her cath
was planned for Monday morning. This chest pain occurred on
4/23/99 , again of elevated blood pressure 200/107. It was
relieved by increasing her IV TNG drip to 7.5 mg , IV Lopressor , and
three sublingual nitroglycerins. The patient had no EKG changes ,
and had no other chest pain over the weekend. The patient was
continued on heparin , IV TNG , aspirin , and captopril. Over the
week , her Lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg t.i.d. for better beta
blockade. The patient also had her dose of NPH adjusted to half
her regular dose , as she was having low blood sugars.
The patient&apos;s catheterization ultimately was 2/11/99. Findings
included a clean left main coronary artery , a LAD with luminal
irregularities , small vessel in general , and a T1 with about 60%
stenosis , also small vessel , and circumflex with about 70% mid
stenosis. The RCA , where her past stents had been placed , was
completely occluded , which was ballooned and a brief examination of
the abdominal aorta for renal artery stenosis revealed no evidence
of renal artery stenosis. Thus , no stents were placed , but the
patient&apos;s old stents were ballooned open with good achieved flow
and 40% residual after ballooning. The patient continued to do
well the day post-cath and ultimately was sent home the following
morning with follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Zinkl
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ECASA 325 mg p.o. q.d.; captopril 37.5 mg
p.o. t.i.d.; NPH 25 U subcu. q.a.m.;
Regular 15 U subcu. q.a.m.; nitroglycerin 1/150 SL 1 tab p.o. q.5
minutes x3 as needed for chest pain; Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Imdur
60 mg p.o. q.d.; Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.a.m.; Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
t.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her
cardiologist , Dr. Garnett in 1-2 weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
