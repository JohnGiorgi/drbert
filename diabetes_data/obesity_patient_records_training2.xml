Discharge Date: 8/6/1994
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CHEST PAIN
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72 year old , black
female with a history of coronary
artery disease , inferior infarct , mitral valve replacement ,
hypertension , atrial flutter who presented with six hours of chest
pain. The patient has had episodes of chest pain in the past.
Today the pain spread to her epigastrium and made her nauseated and
diaphoretic. She was very short of breath. She stood up , became
dizzy and vomited once. She was brought by a neighbor to the
Emergency Room. In the Emergency Room she received sublingual
Nitroglycerin x 3 and 2 mg of Morphine , 2&quot; of Nitropaste with
relief of her chest pain. Her EKG had no changes going from pain
to pain free. She was admitted for rule out of myocardial
infarction. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is significant for rheumatic
heart disease diagnosed at age 30. In 1965 she had a mitral valve
commissurotomy and in 1981 she had an mitral valve replacement with
St. Jude valve. In October of 1992 she was noted to have atrial
flutter and she was started on Clonidine , switched to Quinidine and
then put on Pravastatin. She has been cardioverted three times
most recently in October of 1994. History of congestive heart
failure , deep venous thrombosis x 2 , adult onset diabetes on NPH 10
units q AM , rheumatoid arthritis , question of cerebrovascular
accident and thyroid nodule , status post Iodine treatment. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: As above. ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN. She develops
anaphylaxis; ASPIRIN she gets a rash. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were Lopressor , Coumadin , Lasix , Pravastatin , Plaquenil and
Insulin. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. No alcohol , tobacco or
drug use. FAMILY HISTORY: She had a mother , brother and son all
who are notable for having irregular heart beats.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission she was afebrile. Blood
pressure was 200/palpable to 130/85. Her
saturation was 98%. Physical examination was unremarkable. Her
chest had bilateral crackles , left greater than right. On cardiac
examination her heart showed regular rate and rhythm , S-1 , S-2 with
slight S-1 snap. No rubs or gallops. Belly was soft. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Pulses were intact. She was neurologically
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for an elevated Chloride and an uric
acid of 7.8. Her first CK was 5.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. She was started on Heparin ,
Lopressor and Nitropaste. Her Insulin was continued with q.i.d.
finger sticks and she was continued on her Pravastatin and her
Coumadin was held at this time. The patient remained stable with
subsequent CK&apos;s being 54 , 55 and 46. The patient&apos;s Lopressor was
increased to increase her rate control during her admission and
then her Coumadin was restarted. A Cardiology consultation was
obtained and the patient was begun on Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. with
adequate blood pressure tolerance. Her Lopressor was increased to
100 b.i.d. to improve symptomatic control. During her admission
the patient had experienced some chest pain on hospital day number
three. There were no EKG changes at that time and the pain
resolved spontaneously. The Cardiology Team at this point
recommended continuing medical management as the patient was in
reasonably good control of her pain and was not particularly
interested in more aggressive intervention at this time. She did
have a MIBI that was performed , however , that was equivical
secondary to cardiac rotation in a setting of atypical chest pain.
The Cardiology Team felt that it was not necessary to cath this
patient , however , they did recommend noninvasive studies of her
legs , PVR&apos;s and AVI&apos;s as an outpatient to evaluate possible
claudication.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on March , 1994.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. and
Isordil 10 mg t.i.d.; Insulin 10 units NPH , q AM. FOLLOW-UP CARE:
The attending on the case was Dr. Brockie and the patient is to
follow-up with Dr. Allen Salasar in RAM GAATAUER HOSPITAL Clinic.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: JOSILOWSKY , ODELL MD
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Freddie Fluegge , 216-754-4187
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wiest is an 83-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including CAD status post CABG ,
diabetes mellitus , CHF ( EF 55% ) and atrial fibrillation who
presented with hypotension , likely secondary to sepsis from right
lower extremity cellulitis. She developed the right lower
extremity cellulitis one month ago. Two days prior to
admission , pt developed worsening erythema , edema and tenderness
along with chills and sweats. She was brought into the emergency
room on 8/7/06 and was found to be hypotensive with a systolic
blood pressure in the 80s. She was given IV fluids and started
on vancomycin , aztreonam , and clindamycin , but remained
hypotensive. She was started on dopamine , Levophed and
vasopressin as well as Decadron. Surgery was consulted for biopsy as to rule
out the possibility of necrotizing fascitis. A
CT of her lower extremity was done in the ED and she was admitted to the MICU.
Pt&apos;s blood cultures grew group A streptococcus. Her wound culture grew
group A strep and E. coli. Pt was also dx with a klebseilla UTI. Her
antibiotics were changed to vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl.
Her blood pressure improved and on the day of transfer to the
floor on 3/9/06 , she was noted to be oliguric , presumably
due ATN secondary to hypotension. Her urine
output continued to drop and she developed a metabolic acidosis
with a bicarbonate of 10. Her lactic acid at that point was 4.4. Her ABG was:
7. 9/23/98 and she was transferred back to the
MICU.
From a renal perspective , ARF was less likely to be post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis because of the timing of her strep infection.
She had no hypertension or WBC casts. The UA was
positive for hematuria. She had low complement levels , so there
was some question of HUS after group B strep infection ,
although there were no schistocytes on her smear. The pt was
aneuric on admission to the MICU and she started renal
replacement therapy. Her urine output recovered and
was greater than 800 mL daily while in the ICU.
However , by the day of transfer to the floor on 4/30/06 , her urine output
started to decrease and she started intermittent
dialysis via a tunneled LIJ catheter. The renal team followed her closely and
her meds were renally dosed. Her vancomycin was dosed by level.
In terms of her hypertension , her blood pressure has normalized and
her beta-blocker is being titrated upwards.
From a cardiac perspective , the pt&apos;s troponin hit a high of
0.87 in the setting of septic shock. She was evaluated by MMMC
cardiology , and this was felt to be consistent with demand
ischemia. She has actually been asymptomatic from a cardiac
standpoint. She was continued on daily aspirin. Her LDL was 63
and a statin was started. She will actually need her fasting
lipids checked once her acute illness has passed and her LDL goal
is less than 70. The patient has a history of AFIB on Coumadin.
Her INR goal is 2-3. Her INR is drifting down. She is off of
Coumadin because she has several lines that needed to be pulled ,
including a right subclavian. The hemodialysis catheter will either be
removed , if she has improved urine output , or a more permanent type of access
will be placed. She will be on prophylactic heparin t.i.d. for DVT
prophylaxis when her INR hits 1.5.
From a hematologic perspective , the patient initially had thrombocytopenia on
admission. There was some concern for DIC , as there was a very quick rise in
her INR. Fibrinogen; however , was normal and the INR has since stabilized. She
has persistent thrombocytopenia , although her platelet count is recovering.
Her platelet factor 4 antibody was negative.
There was no clear precipitant other than sepsis. She has a
normocytic anemia with a large drop in hematocrit since admission and
there was some concern for hemolysis with the rising
bilirubin , low haptoglobin with multiple immature erythrocytes ,
but no schistocytes were seen on manual diff. She did require
two units of packed red blood cells on this admission. Her
hematocrit and platelets did drop on 2/27/06 as the steroids were being
tapered off. Her direct Coombs was negative. Haptoglobin
was within normal limits. Medications causing her
thrombocytopenia like Seroquel and heparin were stopped.
From a pulmonary standpoint , she is oxygenating and ventilating
well and not requiring any supplemental O2. She started tube
feeds on 11/9/06 with some marked hyperglycemia and also
steroids for her hypotension contributing to her hyperglycemia.
She was actually started on an IV insulin protocol in the ICU for better
control and then was transitioned to NPH insulin plus regular
insulin as well as a regular insulin sliding scale with good effect.
Her home regimen was previously Lantus 25 units SC daily. Her
TSH was within normal limits and she will continue levothyroxine.
The patient developed a pain in her left fourth finger during this admission
and the PIP joint was tapped on 2/27/06 by rheumatology. The
appearance of the fluid was consistent with gout. She improved with steroids.
Her right shoulder ultrasound showed a small effusion , which was unlikely to be
infectious per radiology. She was started on Decadron 4 mg p.o. q.6h. , and only
has mild , residual pain.
From a GI perspective , pt&apos;s LFTs rose on 8/27/06
with peak ALT of 122 , T bili of 8.7 , and alkaline phosphatase of
196. She had a rising INR ( off of Coumadin ) consistent with
hepatic injury and hepatocellular dysfunction. Her abdominal CT was
unremarkable. GI was consulted. The etiology was unclear and the differential
diagnosis was drug related liver injury versus infection or shock liver , and
less likely , fatty liver disease. Her hepatitis serologies are
negative and Tylenol has been held since 8/27/06 . Flagyl
and clindamycin were discontinued on 11/9/06 , and her LFTs
trended down. AMA was negative. ASMA was pending at the time of this
dictation.
From a neurologic point of view , the patient initially required
Dilaudid PCA for pain with her legs. Now , she is comfortable on a fentanyl
patch with Dilaudid boluses. Seroquel was started for sedation
and that was actually stopped because of thrombocytopenia.
From a dermatologic standpoint , she has had left lower extremity
venostasis ulcers. She has a right lower extremity arterial
insufficiency ulcer. She was seen by wound care. Vascular
surgery requested that she have ABIs and assessment of her vascular
flow once her acute illness has passed.
For nutrition , the patient started tube feeds through an NG tube given her
prolonged sedation. She will need to continue to improve her nutritional
status. A speech and swallow evaluation was done on 10/27/07
and she has been approved for oral , soft diet.
In terms of access , pt has a right subclavian left IJ hemodialysis catheter.
She had a left radial artery line that was discontinued on 1/3/06 . The right
subclavian will be removed when her INR is 1.5 and the
hemodialysis catheter will either be removed or replaced with
more permanent access depending on her urine output.
For prophylaxis , she is on Nexium. She does not have
pneumo boots on because of cellulitis and heparin was held with
thrombocytopenia , now will be restarted on 10/27/07 or when her
INR is 1.5 rather.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus type II on insulin , CAD
status post CABG ( 1998 ). The right saphenous vein was harvested
for surgery. Since that time , she has had baseline swelling and
edema in the right lower extremity , CHF with diastolic
dysfunction , EF 55% in July 2004 , dry weight is 150 pounds per
the patient. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. Sick sinus
syndrome , status post permanent pacemaker placement in October 2006

insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.7 , gout ,
osteoarthritis , status post left total knee replacement in 1995 ,
status post right total knee replacement in 1990 , hypothyroid ,
osteoporosis , and chronic hearing loss.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Lantus 25 units subcu q.a.m. , NovoLog sliding
scale , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , prednisone taper ( started
11/29/06 ) half tab daily x2 weeks , then half tab every other day
x2 weeks , torsemide 20 mg 2-3 tabs p.o. daily depending on
weight , metoprolol 12.5 p.o. b.i.d. Coumadin? 1 mg p.o. nightly ,
fentanyl 25 mcg per hour q.72h. , potassium , levothyroxine 75 mcg

IMPRESSION: Ms. Holoman is an 83-year-old woman with multiple
medical problems presenting with hypotension likely secondary to
sepsis from her right lower extremity cellulitis and a klebsiella UTI.
PLAN:
1. ID: The patient had group A strep bacteremia likely due to
cellulitis. She was treated empirically with vancomycin x6
weeks. Day one was 11/22/06 . Vancomycin was being dosed bilevel
as the patient was requiring hemodialysis and had decreased urine
output. Echocardiogram was unremarkable for vegetations. Second
echo was pending on 10/27/07 at the time of this dictation to
rule out any kind of vegetation. She did have some spots on her
toes that looked like possible Janeway lesions. Klebsiella UTI
was treated with levofloxacin.
2. Renal: The patient is oliguric acute renal failure on
chronic with question of either a result of sepsis and
vasodilatation and hypotension versus a true ATN. She has been
requiring hemodialysis. Last dialysis was 10/27/07 . Urine
output and improving. The patient may have a permanent tunneled
catheter placed depending on how her urine output recovers. We
will use Lasix p.r.n. to manage volume.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had demand ischemia with a peak
troponin of 0.87 with septic. Her LDL was 63 and a statin was
started. She will continue her aspirin and beta-blocker. We
will recheck her fasting lipids when the acute illness has
resolved as an outpatient. The patient now has normal blood
pressure with titrating her beta-blocker up and considering
adding a second agent to normalize her hypotension. We are
avoiding Ace inhibitors because of her acute renal failure. She
has AFIB , sick sinus syndrome. She is on Coumadin as an
outpatient , has a permanent pacemaker. We are holding her
Coumadin for now and this can be resumed once decision has been
made about hemodialysis access. She had an elevated INR in the
ICU , presumably due to shock liver , as her other LFTs are
also increased simultaneously.
4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus. She has
elevated blood sugars on tube feeds and steroids. We are
titrating up her insulin. Her home regimen is Lantus. the tube
feeds were discontinued on 10/27/07 as the patient was cleared to
eat a diabetic diet and we will transition her insulin
accordingly. She is hypothyroid and we should continue her home
Levoxyl.
5. Rheumatology: The patient had a gout flare in her left hand ,
right shoulder , and right knee. Taps were consistent with gout.
The cultures were no growth to date. She is on a dexamethasone
taper , however decreasing to 1 mg IV q.12h. on 7/9/07 per
rheumatology.
6. Heme: The patient had persistently low platelets and anemia.
Initially , it was a concern for DIC , but the fibrinogen was
normal. There was some concern for hemolysis. Her hematocrit
and platelets dropped in the setting of tapering her steroids and
she actually did require two units of packed red cells on
2/27/06 . Her dexamethasone was then increased. In response to
that , heparin was stopped. Her platelet factor IV antibody is
negative. We will continue to follow her counts as we taper the
steroids. It could be possible that the changes in her
hematocrit and platelets are due to sepsis.
7. GI on 8/27/06 , she developed elevated LFTs. We continued to
follow the trend of her LFTs and they have decreasing at the time
of this dictation.
8. Neurology: The patient has severe pain from gout. She is on
a Dilaudid PCA initially , now is on her home fentanyl patch with
Dilaudid boluses p.r.n.
9. Dermatology: The patient has a history of venostasis ulcers
and right arterial lower extremity insufficiency. She was seen
by wound care and vascular surgery , were continued to follow
their recommendations and when she is an outpatient , she should
have ABIs. She could not have an MRI to study flow to those legs
as she has a pacemaker.
10. FEN: The patient is on a mechanical soft diet with thin
liquids on 10/27/07 . Nutrition is following.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient will need DVT prophylaxis when INR
hits 1.5. She is on a PPI while she is on steroids.
DISPOSITION: Rehabilitation. She has a right subclavian line
that should be removed prior to discharge , and a decision about
the hemodialysis catheter should be made.
Her healthcare proxy is her daughter , Trotochaud , her cell number
739-718-1160 , home number is 110-533-7410.
CODE: DNR/DNI.
CONTINUED CARE PLAN:
1. Follow up the results of all cultures to resolution.
2. Remove right subclavian line.
3. Make a decision about whether or not the patient will need
intermittent hemodialysis and if so , through what access.
4. Resume Coumadin once that access has been placed or once all lines have
been removed.
5. Recheck lipids as an outpatient.
6. ABIs for both legs and followup of chronic , non-healing wound.
7. Continue vancomycin.

Problem List
Ischemia: Patient was admitted with troponin leak of 0.16 , no ekg
changes. Patient&apos;s subsequent troponins were &lt;assay. Patient&apos;s story is
unlikely to be cardiac chest pain. Persantine MIBI was done to rule out
any ischemia. MIBI was negative. Pain could be due to patient&apos;s VATS
procedure. Patient was initially placed on heparin , asa , bblocker , ace ,
high dose statin. Heparin was discontinued and patient was d/c&apos;d on her
outpatient cardiac medications.
Pump: BP&apos;s elevated in ER to 177/95. It is unclear whether patient had
been taking cardiac meds during the week. When patient was placed back
on her outpatient cardiac bp medicines she was well controlled with bp
130s/80s.
Rhythm: The patient remained in nsr during the hospitalization.
Pulmonary: newly diagnosed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. She was
continued on her home regimen of duonebs , o2 by nasal canula
( 2-4L ).
FEN/GI: Nexium for GI prophylaxis
Endo: h/o hypothyroid last tsh 2.9. Patient was continued on synthroid.
Pain control: The patient has a history of admission for Chest wall pain
for VATS. VATs procedure done 3 weeks ago and per outpatient
pulmonologist , patient had been requiring large doses of opioids per her
family members. The patient , however , did not complain of
increased pain at her outpatient visit. During this admission , the
patient did not request any prn pain medication and was comfortable with
regular heart rate throughout the admission. The patient should no
longer require opioids for pain due to the VATS procedure. We are
recommending that the patient take tylenol for pain and follow up with
her PCP if this is unable to control the pain.
Exam at discharge: NAD , JVP flat , crackes at bases , otherwise CTA b/l ,
rrr , s1 , s2 , no m/r/g. No tenderness to palpation over left ribs/VATS
site. Abdomen benign. Extremities without edema. +clubbing

****************Hospital Course******************
61yoF with h/o DM , gout , CRI here with an inflammatory polyarthritis
of the left hand/wrist with overlying swelling. No evidence of
systemic illness at this time. Most likely etiology is gout , given lack
of other clinical signs or risk factors for septic joint.
1. RHEUM: Patient refused left wrist tap. She was followed closely by
rheumatology , who recommended starting steroids and continuing colchicine
for sx relief. Colchicine was decreased to 0.6mg qod given renal
function. Patient was discharged home to finish 1 week steroid taper. At
time of discharge , hand pain and swelling was mildly improved.
2. ID: no signs of septic joint.
3. HEME: Patient was continued on home coumadin.
4. RENAL: Cr at 2.3 near baseline , renally dose medications
5. ENDO: Patient was admitted with hyperglycemia , no evidence of HONK ,
likely related to infection. Hyperglycemia was further worsened by
administration of steroids , as expected. Patient&apos;s insulin requirements
were quantified and standing novolog increased qAC in addition to sliding
scale. Lantus was continued at home dose. Blood glucose was under
improved control at time of discharge. Patient was discharged home with
home lantus/novolog with a sliding scale written out for her. She will
have VNA to help her with glucose management. Thyroid replacement was
continued.

Discharge Date: 10/6/2005
ATTENDING: DOUGLAS SANTO FEATHEROFF MD
Of note , the patient was admitted to the CCU and then transferred
over to the Heart Failure Service mid admission.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory distress.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: CHF , hypertension , bronchospastic asthma ,
nonischemic cardiomyopathy , and pulmonary hypertension.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old female with
hypertension , asthma with baseline PAF , peak flows of 150 to 175 ,
and history of previous nonischemic cardiomyopathy with most
recent EF of 55% on 4/11/04 as well as pulmonary hypertension
with the pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 96 mmHg , who was
in her usual state of health until three or four days prior to
admission when she developed cough and symptoms of an upper
respiratory infection. She had no reported fevers or chills. On
the day of admission , the patient was at her friend&apos;s house.
When she became acutely short of breath , EMS was called and per
report , the patient was in a tripod position , sweaty , and felt to
be in respiratory distress. In the ED , she was given 80 mg IVF
Lasix , several nebulizer treatments , and actually that was done
in field. Shortly after arrival to the ED , the patient appeared
to be in worsening distress and she desaturated in terms of her
oxygen saturation to the 70% to 80%. She was urgently intubated
and at the time of intubation , there were significant amount of
secretions/emesis in the secretions. She was given 120 mg IVF
Lasix. Chest x-ray at that time showed an infiltrate on the left
consistent with pulmonary congestion. Her BNP on admission was
591 , up from 204 on 4/11/04 . The notable labs were CK of 115
and MB fraction of 2.8 , a troponin of 0.62 , and a white blood
cell count of 11.7. Her ABG post intubation was 7.4/54/453 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. Hypertension , asthma , tobacco
use , nonischemic cardiomyopathy , and pulmonary hypertension.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Albuterol , atorvastatin , aspirin 325
mg , Flovent b.i.d. , potassium 20 mEq t.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d. , magnesium oxide , multivitamins , Norvasc 10
mg q.d. , Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , and Valium.
ALLERGIES: Metoprolol to which she gets bronchospasm.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She presently smokes cigarettes approximately
half a pack to one pack per day x 30 years , unknown whether she
drinks alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ARRIVAL: Temperature of 100.1 , she had a
heart rate of 53 in sinus , blood pressure 150/90 , and initial
vent settings included assist control with a tidal volume of 500 ,
breathing at 12 with an FIO2 of 100% , 93%. Exam notable for a
JVP of 8 and 9 , reactive pupils , diffuse expiratory wheezes on
pulmonary exam , irregular tachycardia , S1 , S2 , 3/6 holosystolic
murmur at the left upper sternal border , soft abdomen with
positive bowel sounds , warm extremities , 1+ pitting edema , and
notable labs were as above.
Her CCU course can be summarized by the following:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her pump , she as noted had
pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray and during her CCU stay ,
diuresed approximately 4.7 liters and her weight went down 6 kg.
On transfer to the floor of Cardiology Heart Failure Service , she
still appeared somewhat volume overloaded to despite 100 mg IV
Lasix q. day. In terms of her rate , she was normal. On transfer
from the CCU , she had normal sinus rhythm with occasional signs
of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , which was thought possibly due
to her pulmonary process. In terms of her ischemia , she had some
troponin leak , it was thought to be in the setting of CHF , but
that was trending downward and her blood pressure was difficult
to control likely due to medical noncompliance , longstanding
hypertension at home. She was on captopril , hydralazine , and
amlodipine.
2. In terms o her pulmonary status , there was a question of a
left infiltrate on her chest x-ray , so she was started on
levofloxacin and she was continued to be treated with Solu-Medrol
IV with switching to prednisone 60 mg p.o. Her ABG showed mild
retention that would be expected in the setting and we continued
levalbuterol nebulizers q.4h. as well as Atrovent nebulizers
q.4h. and did not start a steroid taper.
She was transferred from the CCU to the floor on the ACE , October
2005 , after five-day stay in the CCU.
Briefly , summarized her floor course by the following problems:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her pump , she was continued to
be diuresed down to what was thought to be a goal dry weight
between 82 and 84 kg. We were able to accomplish this diuresis
with Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. p.o. and did not need to initiate any
form of drips. We attempted to diurese her down to euvolemic
weight of approximately 84 kg on discharge. Rhythm: On the 30 of August
of October , she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate into the 130s and was placed on the diltiazem IV
drip titrated up to a heart rate below 100 , maximal rate reached
140 to 150. We switched to diltiazem drip over to diltiazem p.o.
t.i.d. up to a dose of eventually 150 mg b.i.d. that was then
sequentially brought down later during the admission. We also
started digoxin p.o. and started heparin for anticoagulation. It
was at that time decided that electrical cardioversion would not
be optimal in her stay , so it was decided that she would be
chemically cardioverted using the drug dofetilide. Otherwise ,
Tikosyn and we initiated the doses of dofetilide on February ,
2005 , first with the loading dose of 250 mcg and then with 500
mcg b.i.d.. She was watched carefully with EKGs before every
dose of dofetilide because of the risk of torsade de pointes and
we kept her magnesium well repleted. She tolerated the chemical
cardioversion and went back into mostly sinus rhythm without too
much ectopy or signs of any other arrhythmia , then we were able
to decrease her diltiazem down to 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. Ischemia:
She had small troponin leaks that eventually resolved , thought to
be due to failure. In terms of her cardiovascular status , a
right heart cath was done on the March , 2004 , which showed
the following pressures: RA pressures of 10 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressures of 12 , and pulmonary artery pressures of 60 with
cardiac output of 6. Swan-Ganz catheter readings also showed
similar pressure suggesting that the causes of her respiratory
distress were more respiratory disease in nature as opposed to
CHF heart failure nature. We , of course , continued gentle
diuresis but proceeded to aggressively manage her respiratory
disease. Blood pressure: She was maintained on a regimen and
eventually discharged in regimen of hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d. ,
Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , diltiazem 60 mg t.i.d. , and lisinopril 20
mg q.d. As her blood pressures had been hard to control , she
left here with blood pressures in the ranges of 120 to 150s/40s
to 70s.
2. Pulmonary wise , her respiratory distress seem to be more due
to her significant component of bronchospasm and slowly improved
throughout the course of admission. We did not begin the taper
of her prednisone until after she was discharged. She was
discharged on 60 mg p.o. q.d. of prednisone and we will begin to
taper after four days to 50 mg q.p.m. p.o. q.d. and then after
four days of that to 40 mg p.o. q.d. , after which the Pulmonology
Service will then determine whether she needs further tapering
and how fast to do it. She is also continued on Flovent 220 mcg
four puffs b.i.d. as well as Advair 500/50 mcg b.i.d. inhalers in
addition to her Atrovent inhalers in the morning five puffs. She
will be arranged for followup in the Pulmonary Clinic , 552-3171 ,
for management of her asthma , COPD , and pulmonary hypertension.
The pulmonary fellow input was greatly appreciated.
3. Heme: She was started on heparin because of the risk of clot
formation during her atrial fibrillation with RVR and then
transitioned to Coumadin with a dose of 5 mg of Coumadin. Should
be followed up in the Coumadin Clinic at ARVCA HEALTH NETWORK ( Onhop Fants Ho Medical Center ) who will draw her INR first starting on the
16 of October of October when she has an appointment with her PCP. Her
renal issues are creatinine , were initially bumped to 1.9 , but
came down steadily to a discharge level of 1.5. She had good
urine output and no other major electrolyte abnormalities after
her initial low sodiums. She did have persistently elevated
bicarbonate levels as would be expected. Her white count was
somewhat high , but she was on steroids and was not thought to be
infected.
She was visited often by many family members and the following
follow-up appointments were made in terms of her disposition:
She has an appointment with Dr. Kent Odonal , her primary care
physician at LISWOOD HEALTH on January , 2005. She has an appointment
with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Roman Harrington on September ,
2005. She has an appointment with the Electrophysiology Service
to follow up on her arrhythmia issues on January , 2005 , and
she will be making an appointment with the Pulmonology Service
and to followup in a few weeks for her bronchospastic issues.
She also has visiting nurses&apos; support setup for her as well as
connection with the Coumadin Clinic at DE MEDICAL CENTER .  She was discharged
in a stable condition on July , 2005 with followup. Her
exam was essentially improved respiratory wise and unchanged
cardiac wise. She felt ready to leave.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler two puffs q.4h. ,
Atrovent inhalers two puffs four times a day , Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Flovent 220 mcg inhaled
b.i.d. , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. , and simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.
In terms of disposition , she again needs Pulmonary followup and
appointment , which the fellow said that she will be called form
the Or-low Chadi Hospital .

HISTORY OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
HISTORY OF REFLUX DISEASE
STATUS POST RIGHT LOWER LEG BYPASS
HISTORY OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year old
Spanish speaking woman with a history
of significant coronary artery disease and other medical problems
as stated above who presented to us in the Emergency Department
complaining of chest pain. The patient was admitted recently on
January for bilateral iliac percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and received a popliteal to posterior tibial bypass
with saphenous vein on the right lower extremity. This was
complicated by a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with a troponin
level of 12.03 on March . The patient then became stable and
was discharged to rehab on August . On the day of admission ,
around 3 p.m. , the patient complained of 3/10 chest pain , headache
as well as upper extremity pain. The patient received Mylanta at
In Valley Hospital without any relief. She also received
Nitroglycerin sublingual x 2 with some relief. Electrocardiogram
was done at the rehab center at around 4 p.m. with no significant
changes compared to her previous electrocardiograms. Once
transport arrived to pick up patient to go to the Emergency
Department at Triingap Medical Center , patient became pain
free. She remained pain free for the entire transport as well as
in the Emergency Room. She denies any radiation of her pain. There
was no nausea or vomiting. However , given her significant past
medical history of coronary artery disease as well as a very recent
non-Q wave myocardial infarction , patient was admitted to the
General Medicine Service for rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Most of it is as stated above. The patient
had a cath in January , 1998 which showed 20% of
LAD stenosis , 70% of diagonal branch stenosis , 95% of the left
circumflex at the OM2 bifurcation and a stent was placed in the
left circumflex. Her echo in July of 1998 showed an ejection
fraction of 60% with mild AS and normal right ventricle function
and size and some left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient has a
coronary artery disease with a MIBI done in September of 1996 which was
notable for inferior ischemia with 5/25 segments. In addition to
her cardiac history and diabetes history , the patient also has a
history of panic attacks.
MEDICATIONS: On admission , the patient arrived with the following
medications: 1. Amlodipine 10 mg q.d. 2. Enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. 3. Atenolol 125 mg b.i.d. 4.
Captopril 100 mg t.i.d. 5. Percocet 1-2 tablets q. 4-6 hours prn
pain. 6. Axid 150 mg b.i.d. 7. Imdur 120 mg b.i.d. 8.
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , 1 tablet every 5 minutes x 3 prn
chest pain. 9. Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin gives the patient a rash. Patient also
reports an allergic reaction to a flu shot and TB shot.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies any history of smoking or
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general , patient is a Spanish speaking
elderly woman who does understand some
English and was resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress.
Vital signs , temperature 99.1 , heart rate 67 , blood pressure
170/90 , respiratory rate 16. Oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters
nasal cannula. Skin examination warm , dry. HEENT , pupils equal ,
round , reactive to light with extraocular muscles intact. Neck was
supple. She had JVD of about 8 centimeters. Lung examination was
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination reveals
regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub or gallop. Abdomen
examination reveals positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender in
palpation. On extremity examination , the patient has a long scar
on her right lower extremity with stitches in place as evidence of
her recent bypass surgery. The wound appears clean with no
exudates and no erythema. There is some mild edema on the right
lower extremity. There was no edema on the left lower extremity.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medicine
Service for rule out myocardial infarction. On
the day of admission , while on the floor , the patient had another
episode of chest pain or chest pressure. However , she reported
that this came on after she had eaten her meal and the pain was
localized to the epigastrium with no radiation. Her
electrocardiogram at that time showed no changes. She was given
some Maalox and this relieved her pain. During this
hospitalization , the patient did not have any cardiac related chest
pain. She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CK of 48
and then 21 and then 14. On admission , she had a troponin level of
0.17 , however , the patient did have a very recent myocardial
infarction on March with a troponin level of 12.03. It is very
possible that her troponin level of 0.17 is just the tail end of a
recent myocardial infarction and the level is on it&apos;s way down.
The patient remained chest pain free and afebrile during this
entire hospital stay. She was stable. Her medical management was
only changed with Hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. added to her list of
medications. Per Cardiology , it is okay for patient to go back to
Honalt Hospital with the plan that she will need further
cardiac studies after she is released from her rehab center.
PROCEDURES: The patient did have a chest x-ray on admission
which showed only mild vascular engorgement and
otherwise normal chest x-ray. Her electrocardiogram on the 17 of August
showed ST depressions in the lateral leads as well as T wave
inversion in AVL. It was normal sinus rhythm. This is basically
with no significant changes compared to the electrocardiogram done
on February .
LABORATORY TESTS: Her CBC was normal. Her chem-7 revealed
sodium 134 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 97 , bicarb
26 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8. Her CK and troponin level was as
mentioned above.
DISPOSITION: Discharge medications: 1. Enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3.
Captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 4. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5.
Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. 6. Maalox 15 milliliters p.o. q. 6
hours prn indigestion. 7. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets 1 tab
every 5 minutes x 3 prn chest pain. 8. Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o.
q. 4-6 hours prn pain. 9. Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 10. Ticlid
250 mg p.o. b.i.d. 11. Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. 12. Imdur 120
mg p.o. b.i.d. Condition on discharge , stable. The patient is to

to admission. The telephone number at the Nielcli Community Hospital is
550-2854. Patient will be followed up by Dr. Rudy Torreon and
Dr. Dewitt Tatel at JMC in about 2 weeks.

Discharge Date: 8/8/1997
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. DIABETES.
4. HISTORY OF MITRAL REGURGITATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old female
with a history of long standing
hypertension and diabetes who says that she had been doing well
until approximately one week prior to admission when she was in Tempefayscot , Michigan 76498 for a wedding and during that time she was unable to follow
her normal strict low salt diet. During that time and since the
time back in Ette Na No the patient began having increasing shortness
of breath , dyspnea on exertion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient on the night prior to admission was unable to sleep
secondary to shortness of breath and sitting up most of the
evening. She went to see her doctor , Dr. Sherbo in Clinic the
next morning who found her to be in congestive heart failure and
recommended her to go to May .  While in the
Emergency Room the patient was given Procardia XL 20 mg p.o. x 1
for a systolic blood pressure greater than 200 , Aspirin , Nitropaste
and IV Lasix. The patient had significant response to the IV Lasix
with complete resolution of her shortness of breath and was
admitted to the Short Stay Unit for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned above and included a stress
echocardiogram in the past which showed
mitral regurgitation , hypokinesis of the septum and AV block on
exertion with an ejection fraction of about 40%.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Cardura , Vasotec and Metoprolol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies any tobacco. Lives with her husband.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature was 98.2 , respirations 14. Her
heart rate was 40 , blood pressure 148/70 ,
saturation 95% on room air. She was a pleasant woman , Spanish
speaking only and was able to speak in full sentences. Neck was
supple with no carotid bruits. Jugular venous pressure was
approximately 8 cm. Lungs clear to auscultation without any
crackles. Heart was in regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI
systolic murmur radiating out to the apex. Abdomen was soft and
nontender. Extremities were without any edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Her electrocardiogram showed bradycardia at 40
with a left bundle branch pattern and she had 2:1
AV block. Her chest x-ray showed an enlarged heart with pleural
effusions and cephalization which was often shown with congestive
heart failure. Her laboratory data SMA-7 was within normal limits.
Her white count was 3.8. Her Hematocrit was 37.9 , Platelet Count
182. Her CPK was within normal limits as were her coagulations.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit
for further evaluation and was ruled out with
serial CPK&apos;s. She was seen by the Cardiology Group who on further
evaluation of her also felt that even with the resolution of her
congestive heart failure she was ready to go home with adjustment
in her blood pressure medications and felt that with her
bradycardia she would not be able to tolerate her Lopressor. It
was felt that the Lopressor was extremely important in her
anti-ischemic regimen and in discussing with her outpatient
Cardiologist , Dr. Konczak , it was felt that a pacemaker placement
would be in her best interest. In that way she could have good
control of her heart rate and maximization of her blood pressure
medications and her increased tolerance of beta blockers. The
patient then underwent pacemaker placement without any difficulty
and it was interrogated the day after placement without any
problem. The patient was doing well with only minimal pain at the
incision site.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged in stable condition with
no reportable disease and no adverse drug reactions.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Keflex 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. for 5 days;
Norvasc 5 mg p.o. qd; Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. qd and Vasotec
20 mg p.o. b.i.d. FOLLOW-UP CARE: The patient will follow-up with
her Cardiologist , Dr. Wes Rounsville in one week and will probably have
her blood pressure medications further adjusted at that point.

right ear. There are no pulmonary problems. Cardiovascular , the
patient denies coronary artery disease , hypertension , chest pain ,
congestive heart failure , or deep venous thrombosis. The patient
has a history of borderline diabetes mellitus with baseline blood
sugars in the 140s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure was 140/80. She is 4&apos;10&quot;
tall and 168 lb. In general , she ambulated
with an antalgic gait on the right with a cane. She required
assistance to get onto the examination table. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose , and throat were significant for pupils being equal and
reactive to light with extraocular muscles intact , and normal
pharynx. There was no evidence of carotid bruits. Her lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her heart was regular in rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. There was no murmur. Her
abdomen was protuberant , but nontender with no organomegaly. There
was a well healed midline incision consistent with cesarean
section. There were no focal neurological deficits. Examination
of her extremities revealed bilateral varus with the right greater
than the left. Active range of motion of the right knee was from a
15 degree extension deficit to approximately 70 degrees. There was
palpable crepitus. She had positive medial and lateral joint line
tenderness. The knee appeared stable to valgus and varus stresses.
She had a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior fullness with no
evidence of ulceration. She was neurovascularly intact. She
received 5 mg of Coumadin preoperatively and was instructed to
discontinue use of Indocin.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the Operating Room on

arthroplasty with a Kinemax system. Estimated blood loss was 300
cc. The tourniquet time was 90 minutes. She received
perioperative antibiotics and was continued on Coumadin in the
postoperative period. Her pain was well controlled with the use of
a PCA pump provided by the anesthesiology department. Her
postoperative course was , for the most part , uncomplicated. She
did have some low grade temperatures with a T max up to 101.8
postoperatively. This seemed to be related mostly to atelectasis.
Her hematocrit was kept greater than 30 with the use of autologous
blood transfusions. On postoperative day two , her white blood cell
count was 13.7 , but had decreased by postoperative day three to 12.
Her electrolytes were well controlled. She was made therapeutic on
Coumadin by postoperative day two with a PT of 16.4 and an INR of
2.0. She worked with the physical therapy department along the
total knee arthroplasty pathway. Her skin dressings were taken
down and the wound was noted to be clean , dry , and intact with no
evidence of erythema or discharge. The patient was felt to be
doing well , although a little bit slow in terms of her physical
therapy. It was felt that she would benefit from a short stay at a
rehabilitation hospital and a consult was placed with the Maldharp Drugties Bamayhost Memorial Hospital .  The patient was discharged to Tion Pidesf Medical Center pending bed

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID/CC: 68 yo retired social worker with cardiac risk factors of obesity ,
hypertension and possible family history admitted with atrial flutter and
found to have ACS.
HPI: Pt is fairly inactive at baseline but over the three days prior to
admission had noted shortness of breath with walking even a few steps.
On night prior to admission , she had severe shortness of breath , unable
to breathe in comfortably even sitting bolt upright; this was accompanied
by substernal chest pressure and profuse diaphoresis. She went to XMC
clinic the following morning reporting the shortness of breath was found
to be in atrial flutter with 2:1 block and 2-3mm lateral ST depressions
in V4-V6. The first EKG in the ED showed new deep , symmetrical T-wave
inversions in V4-V6 , 1-mm concave down ST elevation in lead III and
similar contour in II and aVF although not elevated. First TnI 7.39 ,
MB 21.2. Went to cath lab and found to have active thrombus in the OM
distribution; received drug-eluting stents to OM1 , OM2 , and LCX and
monitored overnight in the CCU with 18 hours of post-procedure
eptifibatide.
Home meds: metoprolol , norvasc , combivent
PEx: On transfer to floor , exam notable for faint bibasilar crackles ,
JVP 14 , S1S2 intermittent gallop , no LE edema.
EKG: atrial flutter with variable block , bifascicular block ( LAFB and
RBBB )
Assessment and Hospital Course:
68 yo woman with non-ST elevation MI and atrial flutter with variable
block , s/p facilitated PCI with 3 stents in OM and LCX distribution.
1 ) CV Ischemia: s/p NSTEMI: ASA , clopidogrel , atorvastatin 80 , atenolol
100 , captopril converted to lisinopril. Pump: CHF , with atrial flutter
and ACS the likely precipitants. Initially required O2 to
maintain sat &gt; 90 but gradually titrated to off. Diuresed well with Lasix
80 IV bid , negative 1 L/day for 3 days and then converted to PO lasix 40.
TTE showed normal LV size , concentric LVH , EF 50% , abnormal septal
motion , mild diffuse HK. Nl RV size/function , mild LAE , mild RAE. No AI ,
mild-mod MR , mild TR. PA 29 + RA. Trace pulmonic regurgitation. Nutrition
was consulted regarding low-fat and low-salt diets , as well as fluid
restriction. Rhythm: Initially rate-controlled on beta-blocker and
diltiazem for goal rate in 60s; she will be discharged on atenolol 100 mg
po QD. She had several 10-14-beat runs of NSVT , treated with aggressive
lyte replacement particularly in light of long QTc. Initiated heparin and
discharged on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. She was not considered an ICD
candidate based on her EF.
2 ) Endo: PEHC chart shows a diagnosis of diabetes. No fingersticks were
elevated this admission; a hemoglobin A1C was 6.2%. Likely to have
glucose intolerance and will benefit from weight loss.

Discharge Date: 8/2/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old woman
with a history of cardiomyopathy who
presents with two weeks of peripheral swelling , shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion , and chest pain with exertion. She has
a history of hypertension. She presented in 1991 with shortness of
breath , substernal chest pain , and three pillow orthopnea. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction back then and was thought to
be in congestive heart failure secondary to hypertension. An echo ,
at that time , showed a moderately dilated left ventricular ,
moderately concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , abnormal septal
motion , and diffuse severe left ventricular contractive function.
She was also noted to have MR , AI , and TR , at that time. An
exercise tolerance test was done and she went for two to three
minutes with no ECG changes , but with chest pain and underwent
cardiac catheterization. Her coronaries were clear , at that time ,
but the catheterization did reveal restrictive etiology with
equilibria of pressures that separated with Valsalva maneuvers.
The patient was also noted to have a hematocrit of 34 with black
tarry stool , at that time , and there was no work up done. The
patient did well for a few years after that and , in 1997 , she had
an echo which showed an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient did
well again until three to four months ago when she began having
shortness of breath. On 9 of October 1998 , she had swelling in her
feet , dyspnea on exertion after half a block or stairs , and chest
pain on exertion. The chest pain was subxiphoid and is a pressure
like pain. The patient also had palpitations on occasions with the
chest pain. The pain did not radiate. After five to 15 minutes of
rest , the pain would go away. The patient does have three pillow
orthopnea , but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and no syncope. She
has no fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or dysuria.
Last Tuesday , she went running for a bus and had shortness of
breath , chest pain , and diaphoresis. After 15 minutes , she felt
better. She came in for a troponin level of 0.01 , she ruled out.
Her cardiac risk factors are diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , obesity , and family
history with mother who died of a heart attack in her 70s. The
patient has new ECG findings with a left bundle branch block.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination , the patient&apos;s vital signs
were stable with a temperature of 98 , heart
rate 93 , blood pressure 138/90 , and respiratory rate 20. She was
saturating at 100% on two liters of oxygen. Examination showed 12
cm JVD , positive hepatojugular reflex. Lungs were clear. Heart
was tachycardic with regular rhythm , S1 , S2 , and S3 , as well as a
murmur in the left lower sternal border that was II/VI systolic.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray on admission showed cardiomegaly with
changes consistent with edema. The patient also
had a hematocrit of 26 on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was started on Lasix and also
received two units of blood. The patient
underwent severe diuresis and also had an echo , which showed an
ejection fraction of 35% , diffuse hypokinesis , dysfunction of the
anteroseptal and anterolateral walls , 4+ MR , and 4+ TR , as well as
50 mmHg right systolic pressures greater than diastolic pressures.
The patient improved with transfusion and diuresis. The patient
was also started on digoxin. On discharge , the patient had follow
up appointments with gynecology and GI , as well as her primary care
doctor and the congestive heart failure service.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.day , iron 300 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.day , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.day , and

ATTENDING: DANE MULFORD MD
INDICATION FOR SURGERY:
Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history
of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the ED with two-day
history of epigastric pain and chest pain radiating to her left
arm. The patient states that she had been having on and off
chest pain since about 6/8 and had been diagnosed previously
with gastritis. She presented to the Circbo Medical Center in April and
again with complaints of chest pain and epigastric pain. At that
time , she was found to have extreme PDA defect by MIBI. She was
also tested and thought to have H. pylori gastritis which
apparently was causing her chronic chest pain. On the day of
admission , the patient began to have chest pain which was not
relieved by Maalox. She described the pain as peristernal
accompanied by nausea and vomiting and some diaphoresis. It was
relieved in the ED by two sublingual nitroglycerins. She had
negative cardiac enzymes x 2 and was admitted for a workup.
Repeat stress MIBI showed reversible LA and circumflex defects
and an EF of 50%. Cardiac cath revealed three-vessel disease and
the patient is now scheduled for CABG. The patient originally
speaks Creole; however , she can speak and understand English.
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS:
The patient has a history of class III angina that has not had
any recently accelerated angina , and there is history of class
III heart failure. She is in normal sinus rhythm right now.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , diabetes insulin dependent with history of obesity
with gastritis , neuropathy , and retinopathy secondary to
diabetes , and received immunization as a child in Lake
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
None found.
FAMILY HISTORY:
No family history of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Emigrated from Strutzki Dipoquick Waley Dr , Hobalt Fordo Ward , Minnesota 16458 in 1993 , has full freedom , lives with two
daughters. The patient is an employed housekeeper at an outside
hospital.
ALLERGIES:
Metformin caused GI intolerance.
MEDICATIONS:
Lopressor 25 p.o. q.i.d. , captopril 6.25 p.o. t.i.d. , aspirin 650
mg q.d. , Lovenox 100 sq. b.i.d. , atorvastatin 800 mg p.o. q.d. ,
NPH 60 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , and Nexium 20 mg p.o.
q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is 5 feet 1 inch tall , 89 kilos , temperature of 98
degree Fahrenheit , heart rate of 71 per minute , and blood
pressure left arm 112/68. HEENT: PERRLA. Dentition is without
evidence of any infection and no carotid bruits. Chest: No
incision. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Pulses 2+
in carotids , radials , and femorals bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis
1+ bilaterally , posterior tibial nonpalpable but dopplerable on
the left and 1+ on the right. Allen&apos;s test of the left upper
extremity was normal. Pulse oximetry use right upper extremity
was normal. Pulse oximetry use right slightly sluggish ; the
patient is right handed. Respiratory: Breath sounds clear
bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , no incisions , no masses noted.
Rectal: Deferred for now. Extremities: Venous striatus
discoloration bilateral lower extremities. Neuro: Alert and
oriented. No focal deficits , 98% on room air.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
Sodium of 136 , potassium of 4.3 , chloride of 101 , bicarb ??___??
Repeat INR , Echocardiogram showed an EF of 36% with mild mitral
??___?? ST elevation ??____?? Moderate LV function was noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
??___?? within normal limits so vascular causes of pain in the
right lower extremity was ruled out and they recommended leg
elevation as part of the treatment so Orthopedics was consulted
to delineate the reason for the excruciating right lower
extremity pain which is still pending.
Cardiovascular: She is on Lopressor and captopril , and the
patient apparently had an inferior wall MI postop. Reason seems
to be poor targets , CPK and MBs were cycled continuously for
three more days in the ICU. The MBs finally started trending
down on day #3 with a peak of 140. The CPKs started trending
down along with the MB as high as 2600 , but on day #5 the CK
started rising again to touch a high level of 5000 which was
being worked up at the time of transfer. Otherwise , she is on
captopril , Lopressor , and doxycycline. Interventional Cardiology
is following her and recommended heparin for a possible
microvascular occlusion in the lower extremities and she was
started on heparin on day #5.
Respiratory: No issues. Extubated expeditiously and she was
weaned from oxygen at the time of transfer.
GI: Taking p.o. and tolerating it well.
Renal: Had issues with urinary infection before , and she had a
blocked Foley on the day of transfer which was flushed and urine
output was normal after that and she got a new Foley after that
and was noted to have a lot of sediments in the urine at that
time which was sent for UA which is still pending at the time of
transfer.
Endocrine: She is a diabetic and Diabetes Service were on board
and the blood sugars were very well control on the 29 of August and on the
15 of September the blood sugars seemed to be out of control and her
NPH was increased according to the Diabetes Service.
Hematology: She is on aspirin and Plavix for poor targets and
coronary artery disease on 81 mg p.o. q.d. and Plavix of 75 p.o.
q.d. , and she was transferred with 2 units of PRBCs during this
course of the ICU stay. No active issues at the time of
transfer.
ID: She was started on levofloxacin , and she was also started on
vancomycin for a possible urine infection and that has to be
continued for at least 5 days of levofloxacin for a positive UA.

Discharge Date: 7/10/2004
ATTENDING: ALONZO BARTON HALE M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Bronchitis and volume overload.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. End-stage renal disease.
2. Diabetes.
3. Bronchitis.
4. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Viale is a 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease
who presents after being discharged from two recent admission to
Gara Medical Center 24 hours after she went to
rehabilitation with fevers , diffuse body pains , and hypertension.
She was admitted from 8/1/2003 to 11/12/2004 for volume
overload treated to the hemodialysis as well as antibiotics ,
vancomycin , gentamicin , and azithromycin for pneumonia. From the
1/27/2004 through 10/4/2004 she was readmitted and presented
with increased lipase , right upper quadrant pain , shortness of
breath , nausea , and decreased oral intake. She was dialyzed and
the lipase was felt to be elevated from poor renal clearance. An
MRI was obtained at that time , which revealed no acute
abnormalities. Transesophageal echocardiogram was also obtained
at that time because of the prior positive blood culture and it
was negative for vegetation or severe valve disease. A chest CT
during this previous admission showed a resolved right pleural
effusion and some improved interstitial pulmonary edema.
On the day prior to admission , she woke up sick and tired at
rehab. She developed a nonproductive cough and some mild
pleuritic chest pain. In addition , she experienced some right
upper and right lower quadrant pain , which she had also had
during her most recent hospitalization. At Mamcount Un Health , her heart rate was 94 , blood pressure 183/81 , and
she was 94% on 2 liters of nasal cannula. She was febrile to
102.5 and was experiencing chills. She was brought into the
emergency department where she was found to have blood pressure
of 134/67. She received 2 mg of morphine approximately a liter
of normal saline and some Tylenol. A CT scan of her abdomen
revealed a fibroid uterus and left kidney cystic lesion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Her admission physical examination was significant for
temperature of 100.2 , blood pressure of 102/53 , and saturating
98% on 2 liters. The patient was mildly anxious. She was
normocephalic and atraumatic and had surgical pupils bilaterally.
Her neck was supple and her jugular venous pressure was 8 cm.
She had decreased breath sounds throughout and had fine scattered
rales throughout her lung fields. Heart was regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur
at the right upper sternal border without any radiation. Her
abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and nondistended with good
bowel sounds. Her extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. She did have a right arm fistula for hemodialysis with a
good thrill. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented x3
and had a steady gait with a walker.
LABORATORY DATA:
Her admission laboratory data was significant for a uremia
related to her end-stage renal disease , normal LFTs , cardiac
enzymes less than assay , and a white count of 17.2 up from 9.2
just two days earlier. Her hematocrit is at baseline of 30.1.
Her UA revealed 2 to 4 white cells , 1+ bacteria , and 8 to 10
hyaline casts. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with no
effusions and some mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature. EKG
revealed normal sinus rhythm and T-wave inversions at 5 and 6 as
well as 1 and AVR , which are old.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: Ms. Hodnefield was maintained on hemodialysis Tuesday ,
Thursday , and Saturdays while in hospital and was followed by the
renal service daily. She was maintained on PhosLo calcium
carbonate and Nephrocaps for optimum mineral balance while on
dialysis. Her right arm fistula had a good thrill throughout.
On her very first day of admission , she became hypertensive
during dialysis , but had a normal blood pressure again after
receiving back the ultrafiltration fluid that had been taken off.
Also of note during her hospital stay , given her fevers and
unrevealing infectious workup , an MRI was completed with a renal
protocol to evaluate this left renal cyst. The cyst was
complicated and appeared to have septations. However , it did not
enhance and upon review with the radiologist it was deemed very
unlikely that this cyst would represent a renal cell carcinoma.
However , her UA did have 1 to 2+ positive blood on repeat in the
hospital without a Foley. At the time of discharge her urine
cytology was pending at the time of discharge.
2. Infectious disease: Given the fact that Ms. Obarr presented
with intermittent fevers all the way up to 102 , some mild
hypertension associated with dialysis , and previous positive
blood cultures , an infectious disease consult was called. After
extensive infectious disease workup including blood cultures ,
urine cultures , abdomen CTs , as well as induced sputum , no source
for infection was revealed. However , it was felt that Ms. Molacek
may have had a viral upper respiratory tract infection and/or
bronchitis which was not treated. She received a single dose of
vancomycin and gentamicin upon admission for her hypertension and
fever , but received no further antibiotics during her hospital
stay. She was afebrile during the last seven days and had a
stable white count and no left shift. Workup
for infectious disease included an HIV test , which was negative.
She was PPD negative. Her induced sputum was negative for
fungus , mycoplasma , and PCP. Her abdominal CT revealed no
obvious abscess and urine analysis was negative. Blood cultures
x2 as well as cultures from previous admissions were held for
fungal and hacek organisms , all of which were negative.
3. Pulmonary: Ms. Altizer &apos;s only stable complaint from her
previous hospital stays has been mild dyspnea. She experienced
dyspnea on exertion after walking 10 to 15 feet. A chest CT from
her last admission revealed no interstitial lung disease , no
significant pulmonary edema , and no infiltrative disease. She
had a set of PSP on 3/11/2003 , which revealed a restrictive
physiology , but may not have had sufficient effort. The
pulmonary consult was called. Of note , the patient had an
echocardiogram from 9/1 , which revealed a pulmonary artery
systolic pressure of 59. It was felt that this may have been
spurious as the previous echocardiogram revealed aortic pressure
in the 30s. She received a repeat an transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed a pulmonary artery systolic pressure
of 36% in right atrium. This is her baseline pressure. The
previous pressure was probably artificially elevated because of
volume overload. This means that it is unlikely that pulmonary
hypertension is causing her shortness of breath. Overnight pulse
oximetry revealed no desaturations and there is a very low
probability of sleep apnea despite habitus and a low probability
based on her history. She does not report any daytime
somnolence. It is possible that outpatient pulmonary function
test and sleep studies will be considered if this dyspnea
continues. There was no need for a right heart catheterization
nor was there any need to pursue further imaging to think about
chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. By the time she
was discharged and working with PT regularly , Ms. Lohmann &apos;s
dyspnea was significantly improved. It is still unclear why she
was no dyspneic and may be a combination of deconditioning ,
repeated hospitalizations , and will be improved with
rehabilitation.
4. Cardiovascular: Ms. Pullian is exhibiting no signs or
ischemia. Her EKG showed chronic lateral T-wave inversions. Her
cardiac enzymes were negative. She was maintained on the baby
aspirin as well as beta-blocker throughout her hospital stay.
Ms. Reenders did have a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed
an estimated ejection fraction of 45 to 50% , some mid septal and
lateral hypokinesis which was old , some mildly thickened aortic
valve with no aortic insufficiency , mildly thickened mitral valve
with mild mitral regurgitation. Her tricuspid valve revealed
there as mild TR and a tricuspid jet of 3 meters per second ,
which was translated into a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of
36 mmHg right atrial pressure. Also , of note she had biatrial
enlargement and normal right ventricle size and function. After
the initial episode of hypertension and hemodialysis , Ms. Plotts
was normotensive throughout the remainder of her hospital stay
and was discharged on a beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor.
5. FEN/GI: Ms. Gottschalk &apos;s abdominal pain resolved on day two of
hospitalization and given a negative CT , normal movements , and no
further abdominal pain , nausea , or vomiting , it was felt that
this may have been related to either due to either viral
gastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome. The patient was
maintained on proton pump inhibition and while inhouse had a low
sodium diabetic diet with 1800 calories as well as low potassium
for her renal care.
6. Disposition: Physical therapy consulted early in Ms.
Crull hospital stay and agreed that she would benefit from
subacute rehabilitation to get her strength back after these
multiple hospitalizations. She was given a walker and could walk
with assistance on a rolling walker. Unfortunately , her home has
stairs and is ill equipped for such a transition from walker to
home so she will benefit from rehabilitation. Ms. Shirai was
discharged in stable condition and will follow up with her
primary care doctor Dr. Mighty at GUAM MEDICAL CENTER Clinic.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: TAPLIN , GERALDO M.D.
REASON FOR ADMISSION: Ms. Aerts was a transfer from Perel Medical Center for further management of severe hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Bawany is a 72-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia ,
peripheral vascular disease , carotid stenosis status post
bilateral carotid endarterectomies in 1996 , chronic kidney
disease , and renal artery stenosis , with a history of multiple
strokes in the past and recent admission to Arive Orro Community Hospital
in October for evaluation of multiple embolic strokes after
presenting with weakness. She had an extensive evaluation at
that time given her history of multiple strokes including: Echo
with bubble study ( negative for PFO or intraventricular clot ) , EF
60-65% , no transesophageal echo was done at that time , CRP and
ESR were elevated , and she has been worked up for vasculitis in
the past , which had been nonrevealing. She was started on niacin
given her elevated lipoprotein A. There was no clear
etiology found for her multiple CVAs. She was discharged to
rehab on 9/18/07 where she had been able to ambulate with a
walker.
On 3/3/07 , Physical Therapy came to the patient&apos;s bedside at
rehab and found her unresponsive. Blood pressure was found to be
elevated at 210/120. Clonidine 0.2 mg and Lopressor 25 mg were
given and her blood pressure remained elevated at 200/100. She
was transferred to the Emergency Department at Sgalls Enbri Memorial Hospital .
At that time , she denied any lightheadedness , chest pain ,
palpitations or shortness of breath prior to this episode and she
did not remember the episode. No focal weakness or changes in
sensation , no vision changes.
On review of systems , she denied any fevers or chills ,
diaphoresis , recent URI , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea , abdominal
pain or dysuria. Head CT at outside hospital reportedly revealed
an old left PCA distribution infarct. Brain MRI revealed tiny
foci of restricted diffusion in the high left frontal region ,
which was thought could indicate a small acute embolic infarct.
Extensive periventricular white matter changes and an old left
PCA infarct were seen. There was no hemorrhage. MRA was normal.
Neck MRI 8/29/07 without contrast revealed moderate focal
stenosis in the proximal left ICA , question small thrombus within
the proximal right ICA. Cardiology , Neurology , Renal and
Vascular Surgery consultations were obtained at the outside
hospital. She had severe hypertension during her admission
there , which was difficult to control and headache that was
treated with Tylenol , Motrin , and morphine IV. Systolic blood
pressures ranged between 117 and 220. Her medications were
adjusted and during that admission , she was started on topical
nitroglycerin , Lopressor , minoxidil and Norvasc. She was
transferred to View Medical Center for further
evaluation given that most of her recent prior medical care had
been here.

Oropharynx was clear. Neck revealed carotid bruits bilaterally.
Her JVP was flat. She had normal carotid upstrokes. Lungs were
clear. Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , 2/6 holosystolic
murmur at her right upper sternal border. Abdomen was obese ,
soft , nontender , nondistended. There was no abdominal bruit.
Extremities showed trace lower extremity edema and 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses. Skin: No rash. Neurologic: She knew her name ,
the Merton Hospital , S and that it was 5/3 .  She was unable to
identify the date or the day of the week. She knew the
president. She was able to spell world backwards and forwards
correctly. She could identify presidents in the past as well.
She was able to name a pen and a watch. She was able to salute
bilaterally. Her strength was 5/5 bilaterally in her deltoids.
Her right triceps were 4/5 , left triceps 4+/5 , biceps 4+/5
bilaterally. Strength was 4-/5 in her bilateral hip flexors ,
dorsi and plantar flexion. She had no hyperreflexia in her
biceps or her patella. She had some right-sided dysmetria on
finger-nose-finger.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Sodium was 133 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 21 , BUN 30 , creatinine was elevated at 2.6. Her
creatinine had been 1.8 in 8/4 , glucose 217 , white count was
7.35 with 63% neutrophils , 26% lymphocytes , 5% monocytes and 6%
eosinophils. Hematocrit was 34 , which was increased from 27 in
October . Platelets were elevated at 503 , 000. They had been
509 , 000 in October as well. LFTs were within normal limits.
Albumin was 3.6 , which is increased from 3 in October . EKG
revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 75. There was no
change from prior.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed a linear opacity in the lower
third of the left lung that is consistent with scarring. Lungs
otherwise well expanded and clear , no significant effusions were
seen and the cardiomediastinal contours were stable with a normal
size heart , calcification in the arch the aorta and mildly
tortuous descending aorta.
The patient had had an echo in the past , 3/6/07 , that revealed
an ejection fraction of 60-65% with evidence of impaired
relaxation. She had an echo on 10/6/07 that was negative for
any intracardiac shunt. She had also had a Holter monitor in
October that revealed a few short runs of SVT that were most
likely atrial tachycardias , but there was no atrial fibrillation.
STUDIES DONE SINCE ADMISSION: Carotid ultrasound 11/23/07 . This
revealed an 80-85% stenosis of mid right internal carotid artery.
There was no evidence of hemodynamically significant disease in
the left carotid artery.
MR brain 6/28/07 . This revealed:
1. Multifocal peripheral cortical infarcts of different ages and
bilateral anterior and posterior circulations with newly
developed foci of acute infarct between 1 and 14 days days old
that suggests ongoing embolism. Cardiac , aortic or carotid
source of emboli should be considered.
2. Focal moderate stenosis or thrombus in the proximal right
ICA. Cervical CTA to evaluate further if indicated.
3. Moderate focal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian
artery and left vertebral artery origin as described , no
visualization of the proximal and mid segment of the nondominant
right vertebral artery as described.
8/20/07 echocardiogram: the left ventricle is normal in size ,
overall left ventricular function is normal. The estimated
ejection fraction is 55-60%. There were no regional wall motion
abnormalities. There was no left ventricular thrombus detected.
The aortic root size was normal. There was no cardiac source of
embolus identified and compared with prior study on 4/18/07 and
10/6/07 , there was no significant change.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Mundhenk is a 72-year-old woman with
multiple medical problems including severe vasculopathy ( carotid
stenosis and renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stent
placement in 8/4 ) , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and
multiple strokes. She was admitted to an outside hospital with
unresponsiveness. She was transferred here for management of her
severe hypertension and worsening kidney function. During this
hospital admission , her medications were adjusted. Initially ,
the nitro paste was stopped. The Lasix was held. Her minoxidil
was also stopped as well. She was continued on clonidine 0.2 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily. Lopressor was also
stopped during this hospital admission and labetalol was started ,
which was titrated up by the time of this dictation. Her
antihypertensives include labetalol 300 mg p.o. q.8 h. , Norvasc
10 mg p.o. daily and clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d. It is very
important that the patient receive her medications at their
scheduled times or her blood pressure will rise. She continued
to complain of headache , particularly on the right side and as
detailed above carotid ultrasound revealed a tight right internal
carotid artery stenosis. Vascular Surgery was consulted and she
is currently scheduled to have a left endarterectomy on Friday ,
1/21/07 after which point she will be cared for by the Vascular
Surgery Service. Given the patient&apos;s kidney disease and severe
hypertension in addition to recent renal artery stent placement ,
Nephrology was consulted as well during her hospital stay. It
was felt that there was no need for intervention regarding her
renal arteries or visualization of her kidneys at this time.
They agreed with holding the furosemide and changing Lopressor to
labetalol and titrating up labetalol as needed. Her clonidine
could also be titrated up by 0.1 mg increments should she need
more blood pressure control in the future , if her heart rate
does not tolerate higher doses of labetalol. The patient&apos;s
creatinine on admission was 2.6 , which subsequently decreased to
2 , however , at the time of this dictation has increased to 2.6
and it is thought that this may be a result of improved blood
pressure control and may be a new baseline; her creatinine will
need to be followed. The patient also has a history of diabetes
and is on insulin and her insulin regimen including NPH and AC
coverage were titrated during this hospital admission.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked during this hospital admission and it
was 6.4. TSH was checked as well and it was within normal
limits.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Dane Goodaker , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Type 2 diabetes.
3. Severe preeclampsia.
4. Status post primary cesarean section.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 42-year-old , G3 , P0 who
presented to Labor and Delivery on 11/10/2003 at 32-4/7 weeks
gestation , dated by a 7-week ultrasound with class B diabetes
mellitus and an increased blood pressure. The patient denied
headaches , visual changes , and epigastric pain. She did report a
16-pound weight gain over the past two weeks and she had 4+
protein on urine dip in the clinic that day. The patient is
treated with insulin for her class B diabetes mellitus during
pregnancy. The patient&apos;s prenatal screens are notable for Rh
positive , antibody negative , RPR nonreactive , Gonorrhea and
Chlamydia negative , hemoglobin electrophoresis AA , hepatitis B
surface antigen negative , TSH was 2.02 , hemoglobin A1C on
9/28/2002 was 8.7 , on 3/2/2002 was 9.4 and a chorionic villus
sampling procedure revealing normal chromosomes. As stated
above , the patient is dated by a 7-week ultrasound. Her current
pregnancy has been followed by Dr. Shelton Reges in the Diabetes
Clinic from 8 weeks of gestation. Her prenatal course is notable
for a history of chronic hypertension. Her blood pressure was
122/70 , range of blood pressures during pregnancy was 100/60 to
130/80. The patient did not require medications during this
pregnancy for blood pressure control. Today in clinic , the
patient had a blood pressure of 158/90 with 4+ protein on dip.
She denied signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. The patient&apos;s
second prenatal issue is a history of class B type2 diabetes
mellitus , on insulin. Her most recent hemoglobin A1C was 6.6 on
2/2/2003 . The patient&apos;s baseline 24-hour urine protein was 59
mg. The patient had good fetal growth on ultrasound. At a
25-week scan , fetal weight was estimated to be 973 g in the 91st
percentile with a normal survey. At 28 weeks , the fetus was
1 , 370 g in the 86th percentile with normal Dopplers. At 32
weeks , the fetus was 1 , 976 g on 11/10/2003 in the 66th percentile
with normal fluids , anterior placenta , vertex position , normal
Dopplers and normal survey. The patient&apos;s third issue in the
pregnancy was morbid obesity with a high BMI. The patient&apos;s
fourth issue was advanced maternal age. She is status post a
chorionic villus sampling for normal chromosomes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed 2 years ago. The patient was treated with oral
glyburide until 6 weeks pregnant and then switched to insulin.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Excision of right facial sebaceous cyst ,
therapeutic abortion x 2.
PAST OB HISTORY: G3 , P0020. Therapeutic TAB in the first
trimester at age 16 , therapeutic TAB in the second trimester at
age 18.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: NPH and Humalog insulin , regimen adjusted according
to blood sugars and prenatal vitamins.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Blood pressure 160/80 ,
afebrile , no acute distress. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft ,
obese , nontender and gravid. Extremities: Showed 3+ edema with
2+ deep tendon reflexes. Fetal heart tones were 140s and
reactive , vertex position for the fetus by Leopold and
ultrasound.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery
for rule out preeclampsia. Her initial laboratory studies
revealed a creatinine of 0.8 , platelets of 323 , ALT 39 , AST 30 ,
uric acid 5.6 , 24-hour urine protein was 2 , 995 mg. The patient
was managed on the labor floor , ruling in for preeclampsia. She
was started on magnesium sulfate therapy for seizure prophylaxis
and she was begun on betamethasone treatment for fetal lung
maturity. Her glucose levels were watched carefully after the
administration of betamethasone. She remained stable. After the
patient was betamethasone complete on 1/24/2003 , an induction of
labor was started using cervical ripening agents. The patient
received Cervidil x 1 , Cytotec x 4 , Foley bulb mechanical
dilatation and low dose Pitocin. After this , she reached 1 cm
dilatation , 25% effacement , -3 station. At this point on
5/2/2003 , due to the failure of initiating labor with cervical
ripening agents and Foley bulb , a decision was made to proceed
with laminaria to mechanically dilate the cervix further. On
5/2/2003 , 28 laminaria were placed in the patient&apos;s cervix and
the patient was restarted on Pitocin. The laminaria were
discontinued and the patient was examined and found to be 3-4 cm ,
50% with a high station. She was continued on Pitocin for
protocol and her cervix did not change. Therefore , the patient
was consented for cesarean section for failure to progress with
induction of labor and severe preeclampsia. The patient had
remained stable in regards to her preeclampsia with stable blood
pressures. On 3/25/2003 , the patient underwent a primary
cesarean section , low transverse for delivery of a 3 pound 7
ounce vigorous infant at 4:35 a.m. , 3/25/2003 . Apgars were 7 at
1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes respectively. The patient tolerated
the procedure well. A JP drain was placed in the subcutaneous
tissue due to the patient&apos;s morbid obesity. The patient&apos;s
postpartum course was notable for restarting the patient on oral
antihypertensives and continuing to monitor her fingerstick blood
glucose levels. The patient was started on hydrochlorothiazide
and lisinopril , which she had been taking prior to pregnancy.
Her fingersticks were checked and she was covered with a Humalog
sliding scale. She was on subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis. The patient&apos;s Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued
prior to her discharge and staples were to remain in place for 10
days. The patient was discharged to home with Visiting Nurse
Services to monitor her blood pressure and her fingersticks. The
patient was to followup with Dr. Spencer Jensrud for further
management of her diabetes and hypertension.

Discharge Date: 8/8/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES
MELLITUS.
4. PNEUMONIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year old woman
with a history of chronic atrial
fibrillation who was admitted with fever , rapid atrial
fibrillation , shortness of breath , and chest pain. She has had
atrial fibrillation for one and a half years and she had been rate
controlled with Digoxin , Lopressor , and Diltiazem in the past. She
had been poorly compliant with her medications. In 9/19 , she had
a MIBI which was negative for reversible perfusion defect and in
6/10 , she had an echo that showed normal left ventricular size and
left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with a large left
atrium. She had moderate distal hypokinesis and trace tricuspid
regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. In 7/13 , she had a Holter
that showed atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter at a rate of 70 to
185. In 4/3 , she was admitted to Chokern Hospital
with substernal chest pain and increasing shortness of breath. A
chest X-Ray at this time showed pulmonary edema. She was treated
with intravenous Lopressor and Lasix and ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. One day prior to admission , the patient noted the
onset of increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. She had a
cough productive of yellow sputum. She was seen in the Emergency
Room and at that time , was afebrile with an O2 saturation of 93% on
room air. She was in atrial fibrillation at 100 and her
laboratories were within normal limits. She was discharged to
home. She returned to the Emergency Ward several hours later with
persistent shortness of breath now complaining of substernal chest
pain. She did have a temperature of 101 at this point and she was
admitted for further evaluation. She was given Lasix 20 mg
intravenously in the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1 ) Chronic atrial
fibrillation. 2 ) Hypertension. 3 )
Non-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 4 ) Diverticulitis status
post sigmoid colectomy. 5 ) Status post ventral hernia repair. 6 )
Status post right carpal-tunnel release.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 mg , Restoril p.r.n. , Atenolol 50
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Digoxin. She does not smoke
or drink any alcohol.
ALLERGIES: She is allergic to Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a Hispanic woman in no apparent
distress. Her temperature was 101.6 , blood
pressure 122/70 , heart rate 110 , she was saturating 99% on two
liters. HEENT: Examination was within normal limits. NECK:
Supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.
CHEST: Showed diffuse expiratory wheezes with crackles at the left
base. CARDIAC: Examination showed an S1 and S2 with an irregular
heartbeat , there were no murmurs , and her carotids were 2+ without
bruits. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and non-distended.
EXTREMITIES: Showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray showed pulmonary edema with
question of an infiltrate at the left base
in addition. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 111 and
she had no T wave or ST segment changes. Her SMA 7 was within
normal limits , her white blood cell count was 8.7 , her hematocrit
was 42 , her platelets were 201 , her liver function tests were
within normal limits , her INR on admission was 1.7 , and her digoxin
level was 0.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for possible pneumonia
and rule out myocardial infarction as well as
congestive heart failure. She was started on Cefotaxime
intravenously and put on nebulized inhalers. All cultures , blood
and sputum cultures , were negative and her chest X-Ray the next day
was clear suggesting that the patient most likely had a
tracheobronchitis rather than an actual pneumonia. From a cardiac
standpoint , she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction
protocol. She ruled out , she was given increased diuresis , and her
rales and wheezes improved. Over the next several days , she did
well , however , she did have still some evidence of congestive heart
failure on examination. An echo was obtained which showed an
ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with normal left ventricular size.
The patient was therefore changed from Digoxin to Diltiazem 60
t.i.d. for her rate control for atrial fibrillation. Her Lasix
dose was also increased to 40 mg p.o. q.d. The Atenolol was
discontinued. The patient did very well on this regimen. She had
no further evidence of rales or wheezing and her congestive heart
failure seemed to be in much better control. Her heart rate was
well controlled on the Diltiazem at a rate of 60 to 70 with blood
pressures of 120/70. Her initial complaints of cough also
resolved. She was changed to p.o. antibiotics and was sent home to
complete a ten day course for presumed pneumonia.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged in good condition on
7/18/95 . She is to follow-up with Dr. Cuzzi , her
primary medical doctor , on Monday , 4/13/95 at his walk-in clinic.
DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Beclovent four puffs inhaled
b.i.d. , Cephradine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for five days , Diltiazem 60
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Robitussin cough medicine
p.r.n. , Atrovent Inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. , and Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q.d.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
*CC: Chest , shoulder pain
*HPI: 43y diabetic man with 3vD , discharged from MCH on 4/11 after
3vCABG , initially manifested as chest tightness and L shoulder pain.
CABG was notable for complex anatomy ( LIMA-LAD , LRad-Ao-OM1 ,
LVB/SVG-PDA ) with small-caliber grafts and a postop course complicated by
MI and pneumonia. Mr. Meisch currently presents with 12 hours continuous
6/10 chest pressure at rest , also sharp L shoulder pain. In the ED , his
pain was relieved by NTG/narcotic. His EKG and cardiac enzymes suggested
against an acute coronary syndrome. He was admitted with suspicion of
pericarditis / pericardial effusion based on history and exam.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable in - house but noted to be
hypervolemic with JVP 12cm , clear lungs , and s4 gallop without rub on
cardiac exam , and displaying mild peripheral edema. A sestamibi -
adenosine stress study displayed a small inferobasal area of reversible
perfusion defect without wall motion abnormality. A cardiac
echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated left ventricle with inferior
hypokinesis , an EF of 70% and free of effusion. These tests were
unchanged or improved verses similar tests performed during his prior
admission.
Mr. Constantino was diuresed with 20mg Lasix IV x1 followed by 20mg Lasix PO
x1 to which he responded well. At the time of discharge , his chest pain
had complety resolved and he was nearly euvolemic. Also on this
admission , he was noted to develop a bad taste in his mouth as a result of
captopril use. He was then switched to lisinopril with resolution of
symptoms.
Of note during this admission , Mr. Parone agreed to see a consultant from
the WC department of Psychiatry for numerous issues within his personal
life which have been causing him distress. Formal recommendations from
psychiatry after extended conversions with Mr. Knapick include a referral
to Family Services at Pin Chiblan Hospital Center for couple&apos;s
therapy for him and his wife as well as referral to VGMC outpatient
psychiatry for individual and possibly pharmacologic therapy.

Discharge Date: 4/5/2005
ATTENDING: FREDERICK GOLICK MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Left hip infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 60-year-old female who sustained a mechanical fall out
of bed on 11/8/04 and suffered a left subtrochanteric fracture
for which she underwent left intramedullary nailing at Rush-j Hospital by Dr. Hipolito Soderquist . Some weeks later ,
she returned with a left hip infection with drainage noted from
her wound. An irrigation and debridement was performed at an
outside hospital where concern for sepsis had developed in the
context of hypotension. Cultures from this procedure grew out
Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. She was transferred
to the Lomorerey Tonlarg Hospitals for further management; and
on 5/29/05 , another irrigation and debridement was performed by
Dr. Matula . Vancomycin and rifampin were begun at this time.
She was discharged to rehabilitation , had convalesced , and
returned home. Not four days later , she was found on follow up
to have continued drainage from the wound and increased pain in
her left hip. She was admitted for treatment of continued left
hip infection. The patient arrived with a PICC line in place on
vancomycin for MRSA infection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. Polymyositis.
3. Fibromyalgia.
4. Asthma.
5. GERD.
6. Hypertension.
7. Osteoarthritis.
8. Depression.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Vancomycin 1000 mg IV q.24h.
2. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneous daily.
3. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.
4. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Amitriptyline 100 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6. DuoNeb q.6h. p.r.n. wheeze.
7. Prozac 40 mg p.o. daily.
8. Prednisone 7.5 mg p.o. daily.
9. Benadryl p.r.n.
10. Vicodin p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
Afebrile , heart rate stable , serosanguineous drainage from left
hip wound , range of motion decreased secondary to pain. Left
lower extremity warm and well perfused. Sensation intact to
light touch in all distributions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitting from clinic for further evaluation and
management of the suspected left hip infection. A CT scan was
performed which revealed a 12 cm x 7 cm x 4.5 cm fluid collection
lateral to the hip extending into the surrounding soft tissues
with question of contiguity with the nail/intramedullary space.
Given the patient&apos;s history with general anesthesia including
desaturations and difficulty with ventilation experienced on
irrigation and debridement in April 2004 management aims were
directed towards the conservative if at all possible. YR
Radiology was consulted for potential IR drainage of the
collection and anesthesiology was consulted of her previous
events under sedation. On 3/3/05 , the patient underwent a
CT-guided drainage of fluid collection with placement of a
drainage catheter. A 10 cc of pus was immediately aspirated upon
introduction of the guiding needle. A gram stain revealed 4+
PMNs and no growth on aerobic or anaerobic cultures. Blood
cultures drawn the following day also showed no growth. The
Infectious Disease Service continued to follow the patient in
house with recommendations to continue vancomycin without
rifampin that had been suggested upon previous discharge and
despite her itchiness with infusions since no other signs of
symptoms of allergic or anaphylactic reaction had occurred. Her
vancomycin regimen was changed to 1000 mg IV q.12h. and slightly
higher trough levels were tolerated by the ID Service due to the
patient&apos;s renal function and the persistence of the patient&apos;s
infection. Continued monitoring of vancomycin levels were
therefore not recommended.
Due to continued drainage from the catheterized wound , the
decision was made for treatment of the hip by a multistage
procedure , in which the hardware would be removed and antibiotics
spacer placed temporarily while longterm IV antibiotic treatment
was pursued for at least six weeks and finally the hip replaced
with total arthroplasty , once evidence suggested that infection
had been cleared.
On 11/29/05 , the patient underwent removal of the intramedullary
nail , Girdlestone procedure , and placement of antibiotic beads.
Please see the operative note for further details. The procedure
proceeded without complication including any anesthetic events as
had occurred in the past. She was transfused 2 units of packed
red blood cells due to a postoperative hematocrit of 24
experiencing an appropriate rise following transfusion. Gram
stain from intramedullary reamings showed 2+ polys with no
organisms and cultures revealed no growth. She described minimal
pain and was able to weightbear as tolerated on the left lower
extremity without difficulty. A urinary tract infection was
found on preoperative evaluation for the second stage operation
and she was treated with a seven-day course of levofloxacin.
On 4/23/05 , the patient returned to the OR for removal of
antibiotic beads and placement of an antibiotic spacer , please
see the operative note for further details. This too proceeded
without intraoperative complications , however , postoperatively ,
it was found that the spacer head was slightly dislocated. This
was tolerated and the patient was allowed to weightbear. She did
this minimally secondary to increased pain. She was also again
transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a
hematocrit of 24 with an appropriate rise in her hematocrit
falling. Given the increased pain , the obvious shortening of the
leg with external rotation and without neurovascular compromise
the patient was counseled that operative exploration and
replacement of the spacer would be recommended. While the
patient did understand the need for this , she became more
depressed at the prospect of what described a &quot;set back.&quot;
Psychiatry was consulted for support and potential change in
medications if they deemed fit. They did not recommend any
changes in her current antidepressant regimen but did suggest
continued support by social work. This was indeed the case.
By 10/3/05 , the patient was at the peace with the decision for
further surgery and she returned to the OR. Please see the
operative note for further details. The patient underwent a left
antibiotic space replacement with fusion of the head in the
socket. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Her
postoperative course was unremarkable. She did complain of some
pain with movement of her left hip but this was to be expected
given the fusion of the spacer head with the socket and this pain
did improve with time. She also noted some difficulty with
ambulation given her shorter left leg , a left leg lift was
therefore provided to her. By the time of discharge , she was
voiding , tolerating regular diet , and ambulating with assistance.
Physical therapy did work with her for weightbearing as
tolerated on the left lower extremity with posterior precautions.
She was discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation
facility for further subacute care and with instructions to
continue IV vancomycin for another six weeks ( starting date
9/15/05 ). She was also instructed to follow up with Dr. Muma
in one to two weeks. The patient will followed by the Infectious
Disease Service when she returns in house and the service is
reconsulted at that time.
The patient arrived on the prednisone taper which was eventually
discontinued per patient wishes and agreement with her
rheumatologist , her last dose was on 7/30/05 and she will not
continue with prednisone thereafter.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Please follow electrolytes and vancomycin trough level at
least twice weekly.
2. The patient may shower with assistance , keep incision clean
and dry with dry gauze dressings , changed daily.
3. Continue vancomycin for a six-week course starting on
9/15/05 . A trough up to 30 should be tolerated , please hold for
a creatinine of greater than 1.3 , adjust and hold according to
renal function.
4. Physical therapy , weightbearing as tolerated on the left
lower extremity , leg lift posterior precautions. Follow up with
Dr. Gugel of Orthopedic Surgery in one to two weeks.

At that point , his lab was significant for creatinine 1.4 and BUN
of 25 , total bilirubin of 1.6 , and he has a 10.7 white blood
count and 37 of hematocrit. The patient&apos;s chest x-ray show
questionable right pulmonary edema versus pneumonia and the
patient also had received an echo in the past , which shows an EF
30% , an LVH , hypokinesis of the anterior wall and a mild MR. EKG
was sinus and mild left axis on admission day.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious Disease: The patient has this open ulcer on the left
lower extremity on the posterior thigh shows a 5-8 cm area of
erythematous fascia and muscle exposed likely may be cellulitis ,
but at the time of admission , there was no pus drainage , but
erythema was noted with given patient&apos;s history of diabetes and
recent hospitalization and also pseudomonal infection from the wound , so the
patient will start to treat with vancomycin and Zosyn. However ,
culture shows a Staph , Pseudomonas and Gram-negative rods on
vancomycin and Zosyn , so we changed to ceftazidime and ultimately
changed to imipenem and vancomycin because of sensitivities.
Plastic surgery was consulted and asked for wet-to-dry dressing
and MRI was also achieved and shows no signs of osteomyelitis and
Plastic also thinks that the wound has been well taken care of
during his stay at the hospital , and the lesion has been stable.
The patient should be continued on vancomycin and imipenem as an outpatient and
should be followed by his primary care , Dr. Kory Dengel , in 2 weeks
for wound care as well as for infectious disease follow up.
Plastic , also recommended that the patient should have to
continue his wet-to-dry dressings for wound care. Plastic , also
recommended a cream called Ethezyme , which was instructed to
apply in the lower and upper margin of the ulcer and for daily bandage
changes.
2. Pulmonary: There were no active issues. There was a
questionable pneumonia , however , it was resolved spontaneously
with antibiotic treatment and chest x-ray has been unremarkable
with his following chest x-ray. The last chest x-ray that he
received was on 2/5/06 prior to discharge and it shows moderate
degenerative changes of the mid thoracic spine , but no
significant infiltrates was noted and no focal area of
consolidations. The patient had stable moderate cardiomegaly and
satisfactory positioning of the right central venous catheter ,
which is his PICC for the IV antibiotics. No acute
cardiopulmonary diseases were noted on chest x-ray.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of coronary artery
disease status post a CABG and a congestive heart failure with EF
of 30% status post recent admission for CHF on exacerbation. The
patient was admitted to the hospital with the monitoring of
strict Ins and Outs with daily weight but no apparent active
issues during the hospital stay. The patient has a fluid
restricted diet of less tan 1500 mL and the patient was on
antihypertensive , aspirin , Plavix , as well as on a cardiovascular
diet. Of note , the patient&apos;s captopril 12.5 mg p.o. q. 8h. was
changed to lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily. So , we had to increase
his Lasix to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. at the beginning because of mildly
elevated BNP , however , we decreased a Lasix to 40 mg daily due to
over diuresis and the patient has been doing well for with
negative diuresis of about 1 liter.
4. Hematology: The patient hematocrit has been stable , however ,
that has been stable at 37 and on discharge it was 32 ( please refer to GI for
details ).
5. GI: The patient had a blood cards , has been no issues of
irregular bowel movement about once every two days has been on a
bowel regimen. However , about 2 days prior to discharge on
6/17/06 early morning the patient had a bowel.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Gastroenterology: The patient has no active GI issues during
this whole hospital stay. However , on 6/17/06 , early morning ,
the patient had a one huge bowel movement which included blood
clots that were witnessed by nursing. At that point in time , we
got a hematocrit back and it was 33 , and previous patient&apos;s
hematocrit was 37. Due to this event , the patient was asked to
stay in the hospital for one more night for further evaluation.
A GI consult was called from Hoag F.ka Health , Dr. Haisley ,
and Dr. Cutwright reveals that that the patient actually had a
colonoscopy about a year ago , which shows diverticuli ,
hemorrhoids as well as a cecal AVM that is not actively bleeding.
Dr. Klase , who was the attending at this point in time ,
recommended that we should follow up one more set of labs to make
sure that the patient was not actively bleeding prior to
discharge , and the patient&apos;s hematocrit on 11/12/06 , morning , was
32 as well as on 8/16/05 , morning , was 33 and it was stable.
Overnight , the patient did not have any bowel movement.
Renal: In terms of renal , the patient&apos;s creatinine has been
stable between 1 to 1.2. The patient&apos;s admission creatinine was
1.4 , which has slowly dropped between 1 to 1.2. The patient does
in the past have elevated creatinine which resolved
spontaneously.
Endocrine: In terms of endocrine , the patient is a type II
diabetic , which was covered by sliding scale , and the patient
does have elevated TSH , low TFTs , and due to the patient&apos;s
history of lithium use , there is no need for Synthroid currently.
The patient&apos;s glucose has been well controlled in the hospital
with Lantus of 10 units , and it has been ranging between 110 to
140. The patient will need regular fingerstick of a.c. and at
bedtime before meal time and also at night to ensure that the
patient is covered by enough insulin.
Neurology: In terms of neurology exam , the patient had a CT scan
that was negative , and talking to family members , the patient
actually has returned back to his original mental status. The
patient does have some hearing problem , so it is extremely
important to speak to the patient clearly and may be at times
have to whisper to the patient&apos;s ears for him to able to
understand the communication. The patient had negative CT scan ,
but however , his physical is consistent with Parkinson&apos;s disease.
During the evening time as well as early morning time , the
patient does have waxing and waning episodes where the patient
starts to get confused in terms of times and day as well as
place. However , usually after breakfast , the patient will become
alert and oriented x3 again.
Prophylaxis: The patient is on PPI and Lovenox.
The patient was going to be discharged home on antibiotics. The
patient has completed his 10 days of imipenem antibiotics and
vancomycin of 13 days and the patient will continue antibiotics
for the next one to two weeks and will follow up with Dr. Clarence G Verge , and his clinic number is 689-344-1861. The patient was
discharged home with following medications and they are aspirin

Discharge Date: 2/2/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Toby Glud is a
68-year-old psychiatrist with a
history of hypertension , recent positive exercise test several
weeks prior to admission who now presented with increasing
frequency of chest pain with exertion , as well as at rest. The
patient is admitted for cardiac catheterization.
The patient states that he has been in good health all of his life ,
with history of some hypertension and sinus tachycardia. He is
followed by Drs. Freeman Theron Meley . A routine exercise stress test had
been reported as equivocal for coronary artery disease. Records of
this test are currently unavailable. Since 1995 , the patient has
done well without any anginal symptoms until February 1996 when he
was admitted to the Mara Bleyval Medical Center for rule out
myocardial infarction after experiencing recurrent palpitations and
sudden feelings of hunger associated with chest pressure. At that
time , there were no EKG changes. His CK and troponin levels were
flat. No arrhythmias were noted during the brief hospitalization.
He was discharged on a beta blocker , as well as a calcium channel
blocker. In September 1996 , the patient underwent a repeat annual
exercise stress test. This time , he was able to go only 4.4
minutes , stopped with fatigue , shortness of breath , and
palpitations , noted to correlate with atrial premature beats. He also
developed 4/10 chest pressure that was relieved with rest and
nitroglycerin. His maximum heart rate was 127 , maximum blood
pressure 120/60. EKGs during exercise revealed 2 mm ST depressions
in leads II , III , AVF , and V4 , and 1 mm depressions in leads V3 ,
V5 , and V6. These EKG changes persisted into 30 minutes of
recovery.
In the four weeks following this positive ETT , the patient noted a
drastic decrease in his exercise capacity and he developed onset of
substernal chest pain with exertion. This discomfort was
associated with shortness of breath , no clear radiation. There was
never any nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , or palpitations associated
with this chest pain. In the two weeks prior to admission , the
patient developed similar substernal chest pain at rest on several
occasions. All of these were relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.
On the evening prior to admission , the patient developed substernal
chest pain during a music concert. This occurred at rest and
lasted approximately 10 minutes , relieved with one sublingual
nitroglycerin. The next morning , the patient notified his primary
cardiologist about the increased frequency of his chest pain , and
he was , therefore , admitted for cardiac catheterization.
The patient on admission , was chest pain-free , denies palpitations ,
and shortness of breath. His cardiac risk factors include his age ,
sex , smoking history , positive family history , and elevated
cholesterol level. The patient denies orthopnea , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , and ankle edema. He has no pleuritic chest pain
and no calf tenderness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. &quot;Palpitations&quot; ,
question of premature atrial contractions.
3. Benign prostatic hypertrophy. 4. Depression.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to horse serum which causes a
rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Sular 10 mg q.day. 2. Zebeta 5 mg
q.day. 3. Zoloft 50 mg q.day. 4. Enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg q.day.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s mother suffered a myocardial
infarction in her 70s , also history of strokes.
The patient&apos;s father had a stroke and died of a cerebral
hemorrhage.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with his wife in
Cinnester Boulevard He is currently still
practicing as a psychiatrist. He has a 25 year smoking history , up
to three packs per day. He quit five years ago. He denies alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , well built ,
white male lying in bed in no
apparent distress. His temperature was 97.6 , pulse 56 , blood
pressure 110/64 , and respiratory rate 20. HEENT examination was
anicteric. Oropharynx had no lesions. Neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy. There were brisk carotid upstrokes , but with no
bruits. His JVP was around 6 cm. His lungs were clear to
auscultation. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. His
heart examination had a regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. His
abdomen was soft , nontender , with normal bowel sounds. There was
no hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without
bruits. His extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
He had 2+ DP and PT pulses. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
His deep tendon reflexes were reduced to 0-1+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 144 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 23 , BUN 20 , and creatinine 1.4.
Liver function tests were all within normal limits. His CBC
revealed a white count of 6.10 , hematocrit 37.9 , and platelet count
285 , 000. His PT was 11.8 , PTT 28.5. His fasting cholesterol , done
prior to admission , revealed a triglyceride of 121 , HDL 43 , and LDL
131. Urinalysis was negative. His EKG , on admission , revealed a
normal sinus rhythm at 59 beats per minute and axis up to 68
degrees with normal intervals. There was poor R wave progression
with large R waves in V1 and V2 consistent with an old posterior
infarct. There were occasional APVs with two different PT/T wave
morphologies. His chest x-ray , on admission , revealed no acute
cardiopulmonary process , unchanged from prior film.
ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 68-year-old man with history of
hypertension , positive exercise tolerance test several
weeks prior to admission , now presenting with crescendo angina for
cardiac catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the catheterization
laboratory for cardiac catheterization on the
second day of admission. The catheterization revealed a 60%-70%
proximal stenosis of his LAD and a 40% proximal stenosis of his
RCA. His left circumflex appeared normal. After an extensive
discussion with Dr. Provines , Dr. Latourrette , and Dr. Moe , the decision
was made to stent the LAD lesion. The LAD was subsequently
successfully stented with a 0% residual stenosis. Following the
successful PTCA , the patient was placed on heparin and Ticlid for
48 hours. During this period of time , the patient had one episode
of mild chest discomfort which was epigastric in nature , and was
relieved with Maalox. There were no associated EKG changes. At
the end of the 48 hours of heparin and Ticlid , the patient was
discharged home to complete a total of 28 days of Ticlid. On the
day of discharge , the patient was started on fluvastatin for his
elevated LDL level. He is to follow up with Dr. Blaszczyk for furtther
management.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Sular 10 mg q.day , Zebeta 5 mg q.day ,
Zoloft 50 mg q.day , enteric coated aspirin
325 mg q.day , Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d. times 28 days , fluvastatin 20 mg
q.h.s. , Sarna topical p.r.n. for pruritus.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to follow up
with Dr. Amon and to get q. other week
blood draws for check of his white count for six weeks.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ketzler in
the week following his discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: UNSTABLE ANGINA , ADMITTED FOR
PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY
ANGIOPLASTY.
HYPERTENSION.
BILATERAL RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS.
STATUS POST ONE EPISODE OF ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION ON 13 of October , WITH
SPONTANEOUS RESOLUTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 50 year old white
male transferred from
Re Hospital after an episode of atrial fibrillation on
13 of October , and unstable angina. Cardiac risk factors included
hypertension , smoking , family history. He had a myocardial
infarction in 1970 , and had been basically pain-free until 1985 ,
when he began experiencing stable angina , requiring one sublingual
nitroglycerin every 2 weeks. His typical anginal equivalent is
bilateral wrist tingling , plus some left arm or chest pressure. The
pain is brought on by exertion , relieved by nitroglycerin and rest.
His last exercise tolerance test with thallium was in 26 of September , when
he went 5 minutes on a standard Bruce protocol , and stopped because
of fatigue. Maximal blood pressure was 165/85 , heart rate 95 , rate
pressure product 15675. He experienced his typical wrist
discomfort , an his electrocardiogram showed left ventricular
hypertrophy with strain , focal premature ventricular contractions
and ventricular bigeminy. There was no evidence of ischemia on the
thallium images. On 13 of October , the patient experienced a left arm
dull ache radiating to the left side of his chest , unlike his usual
angina equivalent. It was not relieved by nitroglycerin or by
rest. He called his Tlakeno Rowt. Medical Center Of physician and
went to his local hospital. He denied palpitations , shortness of
breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. On presentation , he was
found to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 140. He
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm and sinus
bradycardia to 55. He had no previous history of atrial
fibrillation. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction ,
and while in the hospital experienced 3 to 4 episodes of his usual
anginal equivalent of wrist pain , relieved by 1 nitroglycerin each
time. It was unclear whether these symptoms were associated with
electrocardiogram changes. He received intravenous
trinitroglycerin at some point , and he was transferred here for
further evaluation of his rest pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed
hypertension , ischemic heart disease as above , peptic ulcer
disease , hiatal hernia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION at the time of
transfer were diltiazem 90 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,
Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams
by mouth twice a day , Lisinopril 5 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Zantac 150 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep , digoxin .25
milligrams by mouth per day. ALLERGIES included no known drug
allergies. FAMILY HISTORY was positive for coronary artery
disease. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient has a desk job at a
furniture store. He used to smoke 3 packs per day , quit 6 years
ago. He drinks 3 beers a week. He lives with his wife and one son
at home , and 2 other grown children. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS was
negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 190/90 , pulse 60 and
regular , respiratory rate 16 , no acute
distress. Head and neck examination was unremarkable , jugular
venous pressure flat. Chest showed diminished breath sounds
diffusely , no wheezes or crackles. Cardiovascular examination
showed a III/VI systolic ejection murmur loudest at the aortic
area , and a II/VI systolic murmur at the apex radiating halfway to
the axilla. Abdomen was soft , benign. Femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally with bruits left greater than right. Extremities
showed no cyanosis , clubbing or edema , palpable pedal pulses.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: An echocardiogram at the outside hospital
on 9 of September , showed left atrium size 42
millimeters , mild left ventricular hypertrophy , posterior
hypokinesis , preserved systolic function , aortic sclerosis with a
peak pressure gradient of 36 mm/HG , read as moderate aortic
stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. The electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm at 70 , left axis deviation , left ventricular
hypertrophy , left atrial enlargement , T-wave inversion in I and
AVL , V5 and V6 , strain pattern. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
SMA-7 was within normal limits , blood urea nitrogen 13 , creatinine
1.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While in the hospital , the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex and right
coronary artery on 18 of May , and bilateral renal artery angioplasty
on 20 of February .  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm. He
experienced angina on 2 of February , with ischemic changes
anterolaterally. He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty on 18 of May , and his 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal
branch #2 was reduced to 30% and the 90% right coronary artery
distal lesion was reduced to a 30% residual. He tolerated the
procedure well with no complications. He also underwent renal
angiography , which showed bilateral renal artery stenosis , and for
this he underwent bilateral renal artery angioplasty on 20 of February ,
which he also tolerated well.
Renal arteriography and angioplasty were performed becuase of drug-resistant
hypertension and continued hypokalemia requiring K repletion even
when off diuretics. Prior work-up had revealed no evidence for
hyperaldosteronism.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was good. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE were Isordil 30 milligrams by mouth 3 times
a day , Zantac 150 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep , Ecotrin 1
by mouth per day , K-Dur 40 mEq by mouth twice a day , Nifedipine 30
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth
per day , Lopressor 100 milligrams by mouth twice a day. It was
felt that in time his antihypertensives can be adjusted as
necessary.

ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a 34-pack-year smoker that quit one year
ago. Denies ETOH or IV drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her abdomen was both soft
and obese. Tender above the midline incision with induration.
There was no overlying erythema.
LABS: Notable for high white blood cell
count of 20.5 as well as a troponin of 0.16.
Imaging: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a
6.1 x 6-cm loculated abscess adjacent to her current hernia , not
communicating with small bowel , also showed no obstruction.
The patient was admitted to the Istsa Anyi Medical Center Surgery Service. After
reviewing once more the imaging , it was determined that the
abscess was involving the mesh placed during the last ventral
hernia repair. The decision to proceed with an
Interventional Radiology guided percutaneous drainage of the
abscess was done. 98 mL of dark brown
and bloody discharge was extruded from this procedure and sent to microbiology ,
two drains were left in place. Eventually , 2+ Klebsiella pneumoniae grew
sensitive to several
antibiotics , for which her antibiotic therapy was redirected to
levofloxacin. On 10/2/07 , the patient was taken
to the operating room to remove the infected mesh. A Cardiology
consult had been obtained because of her troponin leak. The event was
determined to be ischemic in nature;
however , given her surgical indication , Cardiology did not
recommend an intervention at the Cath Lab at the moment; however ,
they do recommend that she is followed as an outpatient. The
patient was then taken to the operating room for an abdominal
wound exploration and removal of mesh.

1. Neuro: The patient did well with p.r.n. morphine and
eventually p.r.n. oxycodone to control her pain. She has a
history of depression , so a Social Work consult was obtained ,
which provided emotional support for the patient.
2. Cardiovascular: She was initially given IV Lopressor
perioperatively and eventually she was restarted on her home
cardiovascular medications. Cardiology continued to follow and
her troponin trended down.
3. Pulmonary: There were no issues.
4. GI: Her diet was going to be advanced , however , on
postoperative day #2 , unfortunately bile was noted to be
seeping out of her abdominal wound , which was interpreted as the
development an enterocutaneous fistula. This was treated with
bowel rest and wet-to-dry dressings initially. Eventually , a VAC
sponge was placed , which after three days was removed and healthy
granulation tissue was appreciated underneath its original place. A new VAC
sponge will be placed once transferred to rehab.
5. GU: Maintenance IVF as needed
6. FEN: A PICC line was placed and TPN was initiated after the
enterocutaneous fistula was identified. TPN is now at goal.
7. Heme: Subcutaneous heparin.
8. Endocrine: Diabetes Service was consulted and a insulin
regimen was initially difficult to achieve due to high blood
glucose measurements initially and brief episodes of hypoglycemia
two days before her discharge. However , her insulin regimen now
appears to be optimal.
9. ID: Initially received vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl
since her admission; however , once the above results were noted ,
this antibiotic regimen was tailored down to a levofloxacin. She
is now being discharged on no antibiotics.
DISCHARGE MEDICATION: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4 h. as needed for
headache or fever to greater than 101 , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily ,
albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs every four hours as needed for
shortness of breath , amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime as
needed for insomnia , Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Diltiazem Extended
Release 120 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o. daily , Prozac 80 mg
p.o. daily , Advair Diskus 550 one puff twice a day , heparin 5000
units subcutaneously every eight hours , insulin NPH Humulin 25
units every morning and 25 units every evening , Insulin Regular
Humulin sliding scale every four hours , Imdur ER 60 mg p.o.
daily , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. daily , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a
day , naftifine topical daily , octreotide acetate 100 mcg
subcutaneously twice a day , oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. every four
hours as needed for pain , and simvastatin 80 mg p.o. at bedtime.
DISPOSITION: Rehabilitation facility.
FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient should contact Dr. Waldhauser for a
followup appointment.
CODE STATUS: The patient is full code.

Discharge Date: 8/4/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Hitch is a 43-year-old status
post coronary artery bypass graft who
presents complaining of left arm and hand numbness with tingling
for twenty-four hours. The patient has a long history of coronary
artery disease starting with development of angina in 1989.
Ultimately , in 27 of June of 1991 , he underwent angioplasty of the lad which
re-stenosed. In 25 of June of 1992 , he had an myocardial infarction and
ultimately underwent a exercise tolerance test which was negative
and he was not catheterized and it was treated with Coumadin for
clot. In 16 of March of 1992 , he had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with
a peak CK of 231 , 6% MB. A catheterization at that time showed
100% LAD with right to left collateralization , an 80% circ and a
70% OM2. He under coronary artery bypass graft with a saphenous to
the OM1 and OM2 and a LIMA to the LAD. The coronary artery bypass
graft was complicated by ventricular fibrillation arrest and he did
have EPS done at that time. Two months later , an echocardiogram
showed an akinetic septum and akinetic apex and decreased left
ventricular function with an ejection fraction of about 40%. Since
his coronary artery bypass graft , the patient denies any chest
pain , shortness of breath or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He is
fairly active , walking a reasonable amount per day but has not yet
returned to work. Last evening after playing a video arcade game ,
the patient noted a pins and needle sensation from the elbow to the
left hand along the lateral side of the arm and a sense of
clumsiness with the left hand. He went to sleep but this feeling
persisted in the morning and he called the MH .  He was evaluated
there and sent for carotid noninvasives in the area which showed a
15% left and a 60% right ICA stenosis by report and was transferred
to the Naton Kanic Medical Center Emergency Room. In the
Emergency Room , he was thought to have proximal hand weakness and
upgoing toe on that same side and EKG changes so he was admitted.
Presently , the patient complains of decreased tingling in the hand
but still some numbness less so on the forearm. He denies
headache , nausea , vomiting or visual changes. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history is significant for
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease as
above , gout , proteinuria with 2.4 grams of protein in a 24-hour
urine in 1989 , morbid obesity. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Lopressor 12.5 mg po b.i.d. and an aspirin a day. ALLERGIES: He
has no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a mechanic
though not currently working. He is married. He was a smoker
until 1992 , when he quit. He also drank significant amounts of
alcohol until 1992 , when she also quit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese white male in no
apparent distress. Blood pressure 142/76.
Pulse: 79 and afebrile. The physical examination showed the head
and neck examination that was unremarkable with fundi that showed
no palpable edema. The lungs were clear to auscultations. The
cardiac examination was unremarkable. The abdomen examination was
obese but had no masses or tenderness. He had trace lower
extremity edema , left greater than the right , consistent with
saphenous vein harvest site with good peripheral pulses. He was
guaiac negative on rectal exam. His neurological examination
showed alert and oriented times three. His cranial nerves were
intact. His discs were sharp bilaterally. He had a question of
mild pronator drift on the left. His strength was 5 out of 5
except for 4 out of 5 interossei on the left. He was able to do
rapid alternating movements. The finger-to-nose within normal
limits. No objective sensory changes to light touch and pin prick.
He did not extinguish to double simulanteous stimuli in his hands
of feet. His gait was within normal limits.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION: His white count was 9.9 , hematocrit
43.9 , platelets of 245 , glucose 115 ,
BUN/creatinine 24/0.7 , EKG normal sinus at 70. He
pseudonormalization of T-waves in V2 through V6 , 1 and L. The
chest X-ray showed no acute changes. A CT of the head showed a
very vague and subtle area of decreased attenuation in the
posterior right frontal lobe. There was no mass effect or no
blood.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for presumed new stroke.
He was begun on Heparin and ultimately once the
Heparin was therapeutic , he was begun on a Coumadin load. His
symptoms of numbness and weakness in the left hand gradually
improved over the course of his hospital stay and he had no other
new significant symptoms. A repeat head CT at seventy-two hours
showed essentially the same vague density as seen on the previous
CT. In addition , he underwent a repeat echocardiogram which showed
no significant changes and no evidence of clot.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition on 8/26/93 . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Discharge
medications include Lopressor 12.5 mg po b.i.d. and enteric coating
aspirin one po q day and Coumadin 10 mg po hs. FOLLOW-UP: He is
to follow up with his TCH primary doctor of a PT check a couple of
days after the discharge.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: SOB
HPI: 33 yo F with history of asthma s/p 15 intubations who was
discharged on 11/23/07 after a 5 days hospitalization for an asthma flair.
The patient reports that she was fine at home initially but that by
Saturday evening approx 2:30AM , she noted worsening SOB and gradual onset
of CP. The pain in her chest was diffuse approx 9/10 in severity without
radiation and worse with movement or inspiratory effort. The SOB did not
abate despite constant albuterol nebs and taking her dose of Prednisone
60mg that morning. She reports that her peak flow was 300 at home and in
the ED. Her baseline is 500. Consequently , she decided to return to the
SSNMC ED. In the short interim since her discharge she reports being
compliant with all of her medications. She stayed at home during this
interval without any clear precipitating trigger including exertion ,
cold air , URI , respiratory irritants such as cleaning products or
perfumes or significant emotional stress. She recently had her carpets
cleaned.

Hospital Course:
1.	Pulm: H/o severe asthma with recent asthma flare , readmitted
after one day at home with worsneing SOB despite being on Prednisone 60mg
qd and Albuteral Nebs. Acutely in the ED , the patient was stable without
significant wheezing , tachypnea , low 02 sats , use of accessory muscles
for inspiration. CXR clear. Triggers were reviewed with the patient.
There were no clear precipitating triggers to this flare other than
carpet cleaning at home. On the floor , the patient received solumedrol x
1 dose then was transitioned back to prednisone. Breath sounds were
diminished but no wheezing was evident. She was continued on duoneb and
albuterol nebulizers for SOB. Singulair was added to her medication
regimen for maximum possible pharmacological coverage. The patient&apos;s
outpatient pulmonologist was consulted , recommended continued CPAP and
outpatient follow up including PFTs. Peak flows improved from 300 to 530
on Hospital day 3. Arrangements were made for her to have CPAP at home
and for outpatient Pulmonary follow up. She will start zyrtec and
flonase for possible allergic component to asthma. On hospital day 2 , her
PPD was read as negative.
2.	CV: The patient was continued on Lisinopril and HCTZ for BP
control. Her JVP was not elevated. A routine EKG showed no changes from
previous exam and nothing to suggest cardiac ischemia. CP
appeared musculoskeletal in origin and the patient was maintained on
oxycodone for pain control.
3.	GI: The patient&apos;s bowel regimen was continued for constipation ,
and will be continued at discharge.
4.	Psych: We continued all home meds for treatment of her
schizoaffective disorder. An appointment for outpatient follow up was
made with her psychiatrist Dr. Fraunfelter .
5.	FEN: The patient was stable. ADA diet. Replete K and MG
6.	PPX: Lovenox was used for DVT prophylaxis while an inpatient
but was discontinued on discharge. She should remain on a PPI while on
steroids

179 , 000. INR was 1.1. His UA was described as contaminated.
Cardiac cath from 2/7/05 , which was performed at the Adli Corn11 Health Center ,
showed a 95% ostial LAD lesion , a 60% mid LAD lesion , an 80%
distal LAD lesion , a 70% proximal D1 lesion , a 40% proximal
circumflex lesion , a 90% ostial OM1 lesion , a 100% proximal RCA

showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 52 , inverted T waves
in V3 , V4 , V5 and V6. A chest x-ray from 11/22/05 was read out
as normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was taken to Surgery on 3/1/05 . The preoperative diagnosis was
unstable angina , three-vessel disease and morbid obesity. The procedure was a
CABG x3. The patient had an anaphylactoid response to aprotinin and
subsequently had an all vein CABG. There was a Y graft , SVG1 connecting SVG2
to the LAD , SVG2 connecting the aorta to OM1 , and SVG3 connecting to PDA. The
patient was brought up from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. He was extubated on postoperative
day #1. He did well over the next several days. He had some intermittent
confusion , but neuro exam was essentially nonfocal , and the patient was
transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #4. At that time ,
neurologically , he was intact. Of note , he had a ventricular fibrillation
arrest in the operating room because of the aprotinin reaction in the
operating room with systolic pressures in the 40s. Open cardiac massage was
required , and he was defibrillated. They used lidocaine and amiodarone during
the code. His CK-MB rose to 37.5 , and his CK was 1646. After his procedure ,
the patient did wake up and was neurologically intact. The patient was on a
regular diet. He had had problems with abdominal distention , but this had
resolved. The patient had also been noted to have an increased creatinine.
However , this also resolved. The patient was a known diabetic and was on
NovoLog sliding scale , and also receiving Lantus. The patient has no
infectious disease issues at that time. The patient was in the Step-Down Unit ,
and on postoperative day #5 , he was noted to spike. Cultures were sent off
which grew out 3+ Gram-native rods. He was started on Flagyl for presumed
aspiration pneumonia. He also is noted to have a positive UTI and was started
on levofloxacin at that time. He also was noted to have a rise in his
creatinine and this was followed as well. On postoperative day #8 , the
patient was again spiked up to 101. Pancultures were sent out as well. He was
found to have a beta-lactamase-resistant E. coli in his urine. This prompted
an ID consult , and the patient was started on nitrofurantoin. Also , at this
time , around postoperative day #9 , it was noted that the patient began to have
some serous drainage from his sternal wound. He was followed by Infectious
Disease at that time , and over the course of the next several days , it was
discovered that the wound grew out Gram-negative rods. A Plastic Surgery
consult was obtained for the patient after a CT scan showed some nonunion of
the sternal table and collection of fluid underneath the sternum. On
postoperative day #11 , it was decided that the patient would benefit from
incision and drainage plus pectoral flap or omental flap for sternal wound
infection , so the patient was taken back to the operating room on 1/25/05 for
incision and drainage of a deep sternal wound infection. At the time of
surgery , a purulent liquid material was expressed through the skin. The
incision was made. The sternum was noted to be totally separated with most of
the wires having been pulled through. The wound was irrigated , and an omental
flap with pectoral advancement was performed. The patient returned from the
operating room to the Surgery Intensive Care Unit where he was again confused ,
however , was able to be easily returned to baseline. Following these
recommendations , the nitrofurantoin was discontinued and the patient was
started on imipenem. Also , the patient was noted to be growing Enterobacter
in his urine and he was started no ceftazidime. The patient did well in the
ICU. He improved from a neuro status. His chest wound healed without
difficulty. He had one brief episode of atrial fibrillation during a coughing
spell , but this also resolved , and the patient was continued on his
antihypertensive medication. The patient was deemed fit for transfer on a
postoperative day #18 back from the ICU once again to the Step-Down Unit.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
1. Neurologically , the patient is Spanish-speaking only. He is
intact , moving all extremities , getting in and out of bed , and
very independent.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient&apos;s heart rate is in 70 to 80 ,
sinus. Blood pressure is 100s to 150s , means are 70s to 100s.
He is on Lopressor 25 mg q.6h. and on amlodipine 5 mg b.i.d.
3. Respiratory: The patient is on room air , saturating 98%.
4. GI: The patient is advanced diet as tolerated , having bowel
movements , on a diabetic diet.
5. Renal: The patient&apos;s Foley is out , running negative 340 for
the day before , on Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Recommendations would
be to have an extra dose or so of Lasix since chest x-ray this
morning was noted to be slightly wet.
6. Endocrine: He is a diabetic. He is on Lantus , NovoLog ,
insulin , and Diabetes Management is following.
7. Heme: The patient is on aspirin and atorvastatin. He still
has chest drains , which are being followed by Plastics who wants
to keep them in.
8. ID: He has got a deep sternal infection with E. coli and is status post a
pectus as well as a omental flap closure. Imipenem was started on 11/19/05 per
ID&apos;s recommendation , needs to continue for six weeks. UTI growing out
Klebsiella and Enterobacter. Imipenem was stared on 11/19/05 , again , this will
need to be continued for six weeks. The patient is also on vancomycin for his
sternal wound infection. This was started on 1/25/05 and needs to continue
for six weeks. Currently , the patient is afebrile. White blood cell count is
10. The chest wound was noted to have a small area of erythema , however , it is
intact , and he is being followed by Plastics.
The rest of the dictation will follow when the patient is
discharged.

Discharge Date: 9/25/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
PROBLEM LIST:
1. Gout.
2. Hypertension.
3. Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair.
4. Prostate carcinoma.
5. Status post aortic valve replacement.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is an 81 year old gentleman with a history
of hypertension status post aortic valve
replacement , congestive heart failure , abdominal aortic aneurysm ,
atrial fibrillation who presents status post syncopal episode on
9/23/99 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Ashmore is an 81 year old gentleman
with a history of hypertension , aortic
insufficiency status post aortic valve replacement , congestive
heart failure and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair who was stable
with baseline dyspnea on exertion until the day prior to admission
when he went out to take the garbage. He states that he stepped
off the curb and passed out. He denies any prodrome syndrome and
denies loss of bowel or bladder function. No fever or chills. He
did not recall the event but remembers coming to and his neighbor
calling the ambulance. He denies any chest pain , shortness of
breath , palpitations , associated with the incident and denies any
similar event in the past. He landed on his left side , face first.
Mr. Biancardi has been treated with propafenone for his atrial
fibrillation and two weeks prior to admission was increased from
150 mg t.i.d. to 300 mg t.i.d. Of note , he had been on
procainamide which was changed to propafenone secondary to an
increasingly positive ANA. During his last visit with his
cardiologist , Dr. Leonard , he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
His propafenone was doubled and was to be followed. At Nair Mancedaypi Ch Hospital , the patient had a work up which included a head CT that
was negative. His INR was found to be 5.4 and electrocardiograms
revealed baseline left bundle branch block/widening of the QRS and
underlying atrial fibrillation. He was also found to have a left
lower lobe pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. He was
transferred here for further evaluation. On 3/7/99 , he was noted
to have a wide complex tachycardia in the 150 beats per minute
range.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Prostate cancer treated with hormone
therapy 7-8 years ago. 2. Gout. 3.
Hypertension. 4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair.
5. Status post aortic valve replacement. 6. Status post
cholecystectomy.

with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right lower
sternal border and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at
the right upper sternal border. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender. Good
bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. No costovertebral angle
tenderness and no spinal tenderness. EXTREMITIES: Cool ,
adequately perfused with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:
He is alert and oriented times three. Motor strength is 5/5
throughout. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric. GAIT: Within normal
limits.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 7.6 ,
hematocrit 40.5 , platelets 139 ,
sodium 139 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN 52 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 98 , magnesium 2.0 , PT 22.2 , PTT 54.7 , INR
3.4.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter with rapid response or an
accelerated junctional rhythm at a rate of 85.
IMPRESSION: This is an 81 year old gentleman with no known history
of coronary artery disease who was status post aortic
valve replacement with homograft repair of the abdominal aortic
aneurysm on Propafenone for atrial fibrillation. Now presenting
with a syncopal episode of presumptive cardiac etiology. Given his
baseline supraventricular tachycardia , the most likely explanation
was a rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation/flutter
with a widened QRS secondary to propafenone.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: Initially his Propafenone
was held given its&apos; ability to increase the QRS
interval. His Coumadin was also held given his supratherapeutic
INR and recent facial traumas. His hematological status was
followed carefully with serial hematocrit checks. He was evaluated
early on by the electrophysiology service and was started on a low
dose beta blocker to prevent him from going back into atrial
fibrillation while off the anticoagulation. An EP study was
planned , however on 7/17/99 the patient had an episode of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which appeared to be different
from his baseline atrial fibrillation. In addition this was not
likely to be a bundle branch re-entry pattern and therefore the
utility of an EP study was thought to be very low. Given this the
EP service favored placement of a DDDR/AIDC post cardiac
catheterization to rule out any coronary disease. Cardiac
catheterization was performed on 5/13/99 and he was found to have
no coronary artery disease. He went for his DDDR/AICD placement on
5/13/99 and this was done successfully. He was continued on his
Captopril and Lopressor and in addition , Amiodarone was started at
400 mg p.o. b.i.d. Two days after pacemaker placement he developed
a temperature to 101.1 and was cultured. The pacer site looked
clean and was not thought to be infected. He received AICD
teaching by the EP service prior to discharge. He will be
continued on his Ancef as an outpatient as well.
2. Hematology: His anticoagulation was held given that he was in
normal sinus rhythm and he had extensive facial fractures and
wounds. He remained out of atrial fibrillation and was not
anticoagulated. His hematocrit and platelets remained stable.
3. ENT: The patient had received nasal packing to his left naris
at Northgy County Hospital and this remained in place for six days. He
was followed by the ENT service here at Geer Medical Center
and their recommendation was for follow up maxillofacial CT scan.
This revealed multiple facial fractures but no orbital floor
fracture. The ophthalmology service was consulted and their
opinion was that he had a normal examination and no evidence of
ocular muscle entrapment , optic neuropathy or globe malposition.
Therefore no operative intervention was required for his
periorbital fractures. He is to follow up in the Put Hospital Health Center eye clinic upon discharge.
He was also seen by the dental service and noted to have infected teeth. He had
a fever the day following his dental exam. This needs to be carefully managed
as he also has a prosthetic valve.
4. Neurological: The patient&apos;s mental status was
at time somewhat worrisome because he became very sleepy and lethargic , however
according to his outpatient cardiologist , Dr. Lato , he is often
this way. Concern was raised for a subdural hematoma given his
recent trauma. However his mental status waxed and waned
periodically and he was also alert and oriented times three.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient will be discharged to
Soren Hetuton Medical Center .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril
12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6
mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with Dr.
Buquo as an outpatient and with the
Inpar Hospital ophthalmology group. His amiodarone
dose will need to be decreased to 200 mg q day in about two weeks
as an outpatient.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Sepsis related to Streptococcal laryngitis
( culture positive ).
OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIAGNOSES: Status post heart transplant in 1989
for viral myocarditis and hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a charming 28-year-old
woman who was diagnosed with viral
myocardial myopathy in 8/2 and received a heart transplant at
Onfu Mauchildin Tinley Medical Center at that time. She did very well with only one
episode of rejection in 1995 , which was treated with OKT-3. She
also successfully carried out a pregnancy. The patient&apos;s husband
reports that she began complaining of sore throat approximately two
days prior to admission and then one day prior to admission
developed fever in early morning of 102.2 with myalgias. She had
poor p.o. intake throughout the weekend and had no nausea and
vomiting at home but developed some in the emergency room. She had
however , had some diarrhea with loose stools , no blood. She felt
dizzy and weak today while getting into the car. She took
over-the-counter medications at home. Her daughter was ill
approximately two months ago and the patient works at a child day
care center where many of the children are ill. She had some lower
abdominal pain but no dysuria or hematuria , no cough , no recent
travel , mild diffuse headache without nystagmus or photophobia. In
the emergency room the patient was afebrile , temperature 99.1 , but
was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 71/33 ,
tachycardic to 136 , respirations of 16 and 96% O2 saturated on room
air. She received two grams of ceftriaxone , 500 mg of levofloxacin
and 1 gram of vancomycin as well as three liters of normal saline ,
intravenous fluid rapid infusion. Her blood pressure was still
marginal from the 80s to 90s systolic. Neo was started at 40 mcg
through peripheral intravenous line and she was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: In addition to the previously mentioned
viral myocarditis and heart transplant in
1989 , with rejection in 1995 treated with OKT-3. She also had
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine from 1.3 to
2.1 , usually in the 1.5 area. She has hypertension. She is
gravida 1 , para 1 , complicated by toxemia requiring Cesarean
section. She also had hyperlipidemia and obesity.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT: Included cyclophosphamide 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Cardura 10 mg q.d. , Imuran 75 mg q.d. ,
prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Vasotec 5 mg q.d. , Pravachol 40 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin and Sulfa which resulted in rashes.
Allergy to intravenous contrast dye which resulted in
pruritic hives. Morphine causing nausea and vomiting and
succinylcholine which the patient reports resulted in respiratory
arrest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission to the Coronary Care Unit , the
patient&apos;s temperature was noted to be 102.6.
She was in sinus tachycardia to the 130s , slightly tachypneic up
to 24 , blood pressure of 98/40 , already on 40 mcg of Neo
intravenously. General: Drowsy , ill-appearing , flush young woman.
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light bilaterally. Extraocular
movements intact. Oropharynx was erythematous with some slight
white exudate on the tonsils and pharynx bilaterally. Mucous
membranes were dry with some white , red exudate on the tongue. She
had some tender cervical chains but not discrete palpable
lymphadenopathy with no neck stiffness , no sinus tenderness.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. There was no dullness
to percussion. Cardiovascular: Revealed rapid but regular rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , with positive S3 at the apex. Abdomen: Soft ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , diffuse , mild tenderness
throughout. Extremities: Warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally. Hands pale with cold fingers. Neurologic: Alert but
drowsy and oriented times four. She was grossly nonfocal.
Examination was limited secondary to the patient&apos;s discomfort.
LABORATORY/X-RAY STUDIES: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 103 ,
bicarbonate 23 , BUN 46 , creatinine 2.8
which was increased from her previous baseline of 1.7 , glucose 92 ,
CK 22 , with troponin 0.07. Last cyclosporine level was 140s to
260s. White blood cells 7.6 with 68 polys and 25 bands.
Hemoglobin 11.3 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 157 , 000. PT 12.9 , INR
1.2 , PTT 33. EKG on admission was sinus tachycardia at 130 with a
normal axis incomplete right bundle branch block with Qs in III and
AVF , no ST-T wave changes and low volts across. Portable chest
x-ray on admission was clear. Blood cultures , throat cultures and
fungal isolators were sent off as well as EBV , CMV-IgM. Throat
culture grew out group A Strep. The patient had some improvement
with levofloxacin and briefly received vancomycin and gentamicin as
well prior to her culture growing out. The patient had worsening
renal function , likely due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to
prerenal azotemia from her initial hypotensive episodes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated briefly with vancomycin
and gentamicin. Throat culture grew out group A
Streptococcus. She improved on levofloxacin. Renal function
worsened likely due to acute tubular necrosis of prerenal azotemia
secondary to her initial hypotensive episodes on admission. She
gradually improved to a creatinine of 1.7 on the day of discharge.
During her hospitalization , she had some mild to moderate pulmonary
edema secondary to vigorous intravenous fluid resuscitation and
support of her blood pressure. She was diuresed with Lasix 20 to
40 mg intravenously q.d. for two days with excellent response and
was discharged below her dry weight. Her diarrhea with nausea and
vomiting was presumptively treated with Flagyl. However ,
Clostridium difficile was negative times two. Ova and parasites ,
fecaliths and stool cultures were all negative. She received
symptomatic relief with Compazine and Imodium. The patient&apos;s
baseline hypertension reappeared after her blood pressures had
stabilized and she was restarted on her outpatient regimen of
Vasotec and Cardura. Her baseline tachycardia was found to have
been evidently longstanding and well tolerated with heart rate of
100 to 120s.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in good condition
on day #5 of a ten-day course of levofloxacin at
renal dose , 250 mg p.o. q.d. and she also continued her usual
immunosuppressive regimen with a cyclosporine level of 454. She
had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Tucay in one week after
discharge. Discharge medications included Imuran 75 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Sandimmune 100 mg b.i.d. , Vasotec 5 mg b.i.d. , Miracle Cream
topically q.d. , prednisone 10 mg q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. ,

Discharge Date: 7/21/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY WOUND INFECTION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54 year old gentleman
who is status post a four vessel
coronary artery bypass graft on 6/15/95 at an outside hospital.
The patient&apos;s postoperative course was complicated by respiratory
failure secondary to presumed phrenic nerve injury. The patient
also developed congestive heart failure. In addition , the patient
had undergone embolectomy and left lower extremity fasciotomy for
left lower extremity ischemia on 5/25/95 . The patient now presents
to Dr. Jaysura with infected left lower leg pressure ulcer with
open and gangrenous muscle exposed through this posterior wound.
The patient was at the rehabilitation center prior to this transfer
to the Wickpro Conch Medical Center .  The patient had no documented
febrile episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular
disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , history
of atrial fibrillation/flutter , right sacroiliac joint decubitus
ulcer.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery bypass graft
on 7/23/95 . Left lower extremity
fasciotomy on 5/25/95 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 81 mg po qd
2. Digoxin 0.325 mg po qd
3. Azmacort 6 puffs inhaled bid
4. Heparin 5000 units subcu bid
5. Zantac 150 mg po bid
6. Lasix 40 mg po qd
7. Capoten 25 mg q 8
8. Albuterol nebulizers 0.5 cc in 2.5 cc normal saline qid
9. NPH insulin 38 units subcu bid
10. Nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc po qid
11. Bactrim DS one tab po bid
THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for 100 pack/year history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100. Blood pressure 120/47 ,
pulse 103 , sinus tachycardia. In
general , the patient was trached and in no acute distress. The
patient&apos;s skin revealed mottled distal extremities. HEENT:
normocephalic , atraumatic head. Trach was in place with a collar.
Lungs: bilateral inspiratory wheezes , scattered throughout.
Heart: regular rhythm with sinus tachycardia. Distant heart
sounds. No S3 or S4 were noted. The patient had no obvious
murmurs. Abdomen: positive bowel sounds. The patient was obese.
Abdomen was nontender , nondistended with no palpable masses. The
patient had multiple ecchymoses. Neurologic: the patient was
alert and oriented times three. Cranial nerves II through XII
grossly intact. Extremities: right buttock with approximately a
10 square centimeter decubitus ulcer. The patient&apos;s right lower
extremity revealed a previous harvest scar with about a 2 cm
incision and breakdown over the calf area. Distal foot has a
mottled appearance but has Dopplerable posterior tibial and
dorsalis pedis pulses. The toes are cool and insensate. Left
lower extremity revealed three open ulcers with marked gangrenous
muscle exposure. The patient had a Dopplerable posterior tibial
with cold pulses but no Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse. The
patient was insensate distally from the region of the wounds down
to the feet.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on 9/11/95 for a preoperative diagnosis of a
left lower extremity infected pressure sore. Intraoperatively , the
patient was noted to have necrosis of both heads of the
gastrocnemius muscle including the soleus and also a portion of the
lateral compartment. The muscle appeared black and necrotic and
there was a marked amount of purulence. Aerobic and anaerobic
cultures were obtained at this time and sent to Microbiology for
gram stains and cultures. All of the visibly blackened and
necrotic muscle was removed and the wound was irrigated with
copious amounts of antibiotic-containing solution. The patient
appeared to tolerate the procedure well and was sent to the
Intensive Care Unit , given the patient&apos;s cardiac history as well as
his ventilator dependence.
The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease service and was
started on Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl empirically until
culture results returned. The patient was taken back on 2/8/95
for a second irrigation and debridement procedure. During this
procedure , some necrotic skin , subcutaneous tissue and fascia were
noted and were sharply debrided free. The wound was relatively
clean upon completion of the procedure with no apparent loculations
or collections or purulence. The muscle also at this time appeared
viable and it was considered that the wound may heal on its own.
The patient was seen by the Vascular Surgery service as well for
his history of left lower extremity ischemia and for his loss of
his dorsalis pedis pulse on his left foot. The left foot remained
cool and insensate with no motor function. The patient did however
have flexion and extension at the knee.
After adequate irrigation and debridement , it was felt that the
patient would not require amputation of his lower extremity given
the viability of the muscle.
NEUROLOGIC. The patient was alert and awake postoperatively. The
patient was appropriate in his neurologic status. The patient
however did appear to have some episodes of anxiety for which he
was placed on Klonopin 1 mg po tid. The patient continued to do
well and had his pain adequately controlled with po Percocet.
RESPIRATORY. The patient was initially weaned off the ventilator
to continue his positive airway pressure with 5 of PEEP and 5 of
pressure support with 50% FIO2. The patient&apos;s tidal volumes were
consistently elevated over 600 and the patient had no subjective
complaints of shortness of breath. However , on postoperative day
#4 and #2 , the patient noted some difficulty catching his breath.
Pressure support was increased back up to 10. This inability of
the patient to maintain his spontaneous tidal volumes was
consistent with a respiratory fatigue secondary to his
diaphragmatic dysfunction. However because the patient appeared to
be weaning from the ventilator initially postop , it was decided
that the patient should have his diaphragmatic function assessed to
see if there had been any change.
The patient underwent a fluoroscopy study to assess his
diaphragmatic excursions on 10/29/95 . The test revealed no
diaphragmatic excursion consistent with phrenic nerve injury. It
was decided at this time that the patient would remain on his
previous ventilator settings of 10 of pressure support and 5 of
CPAP and 50% FIO2 and no further weaning would be attempted.
GASTROINTESTINAL. The patient arrived on tube feedings of Promote.
Because we do not have this at our institution , the patient was
started on a similar formula of full strength Ensure High Protein
at 105 cc/hour. This meets the patient&apos;s full nutritional
requirements.
However , because the patient appears to have no reason for not
encouraging his oral intake , the patient&apos;s tube feeds were
decreased to 50 cc/hour throughout the day for a 12 hour period and
po intake at this time was encouraged. The patient then received
12 hours of his tube feeds at 105 from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. The
patient was placed back on his normal subcutaneous doses of insulin
NPH 38 units in the morning and 38 units at night.
The patient has been treated intermittently with insulin drip for
control of his blood sugars during the times he was taken to and
from the Operating Room. Our goal for this patient is to attempt
to encourage his oral intake and to cycle his tube feeds only at
night. The patient should have 24 hour calorie counts initiated to
assess the adequacy of this oral intake.
GU. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and has good urine
output. The patient has excoriations around his inner thighs which
prevented us from removing his Foley in case the pt has episodes of
urinary incontinence. Once the patient&apos;s inner thighs heal , the
patient may have the Foley removed and the patient may be able to
void on his own in either a bedside urinal or with a condom cath in
place. The patient is receiving his Lasix 40 mg a day.
CARDIOVASCULAR. The patient was initially ruled out for a
myocardial infarction following his first operative procedure. The
patient has had no complaints of chest pain. The patient&apos;s
cardiovascular status has been stable with CVP&apos;s running in the 12
to 13 range. The patient had no episodes of hypotension and has
been continued on his Capoten.
HEMATOLOGIC. The patient has been stable with no issues. The
patient continues on subcutaneous heparin.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The patient was treated with Ampicillin ,
Gentamicin and Flagyl. The patient&apos;s intraoperative cultures from
his left leg ulcer grew out E. coli , sensitive to Ampicillin and
Ofloxacin. The patient also grew out Enterococcus , sensitive also
to Ampicillin and Ofloxacin and Enterobacter cloacae , sensitive to
Gentamicin and Ofloxacin. The patient was switched over from
Gentamicin to Ofloxacin to continue his antibiotic course. The
patient has been followed by the Infectious Disease service.
Because of the time of operation , it was considered that the
infectious tissue was completely debrided , and the patient does not
need to continue on an extensive antibiotic course.
The patient will receive 7 more days of po Ofloxacin as an
outpatient as per the ID service. The patient will have received ,
prior to discharge , a total of 7 days of IV Ampicillin and
Ofloxacin. The Flagyl was discontinued after day #6.
TUBES/LINES/DRAINS. The patient had a triple lumen catheter in
place which was removed on the day prior to discharge. The patient
had a peripheral IV placed in instead. The patient will not be
receiving any IV medications and will continue on oral antibiotic
dosings.
ADDENDUM
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient&apos;s medication upon discharge

catheterization data: EKG , normal sinus rhythm at 67 with a
nonspecific T-wave abnormality in 1 , aVL , V5 , and V6. Chest
x-ray is without acute disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 8/17/05 and underwent cardiac
catheterization the following day , which revealed 90% proximal
LAD stenosis , 90% mid LAD and 100% distal LAD stenosis , 100% mid
LVB1 , 80% mid circumflex , 70% proximal D1 , 70% proximal PDA , and
a right dominant circulation. There is diffuse coronary
calcification and extensive diffuse disease with small distal
vessels. LAD in stent restenosis. There is collateral flow
diffusely small left main. The patient was taken to the
operating room on 11/7/05 and underwent CABG x4 with SVG1 to
RCA , and sequential graft of SVG2 to D1 and then OM1. The
patient also had LIMA to LAD and an LAD endarterectomy. The
patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following surgery in
stable condition. He was given 150 mg of Plavix on arrival to
the ICU , and a second dose 6 hours later. He was also started on
heparin 500 units for 48 hours and given aspirin that same night.
The patient was extubated the following day and was noted to
require the transfusion of a unit of packed red blood cells. He
required neosynephrine transiently , which was weaned off on
postoperative day #2. That same day , he transferred to the
Step-Down Unit , neurologically intact , with pain well controlled ,
hemodynamically stable , started on aspirin , Lopressor , and
Plavix. The patient was also on 2 liters of oxygen at the time
of transfer , and had chest tube in that still had output. The
patient&apos;s diet was being advanced , and he was being diuresed with
Lasix with good effect. Perioperatively , he was also followed by
the Diabetes Management Service for blood sugar control and was
transitioned from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin
postoperatively. The patient was noted to have a preoperative
urinary tract infection of E. coli for which he was started on
levofloxacin on 4/30/05 and treated for five days. On
postoperative day #3 , his wires , chest tubes and Foley were
removed. He was noted to have loose lower front teeth following
his difficult intubation , and the Dental Service was called to
see the patient. The recommendation was simply to avoid putting
pressure on those teeth and they advised that this would allow
the teeth to retighten in the jaw over the next couple of weeks.
The patient continued to do well , remained in sinus rhythm , and
was weaned off oxygen , saturating well on room air. He
progressed daily and walked first with assistance and then
steadily on his own. He is discharged to home in good condition
on postoperative day #7 on the following medications:
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atenolol 75 mg p.o.
daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg to 10 mg p.o.
q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 38 units
subcutaneously at bedtime , NovoLog 18 units subcutaneous q.a.m. ,
NovoLog 12 units subcutaneously with lunch and supper , and
atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily. He is to have a follow-up
appointment with his cardiologist , Dr. Abusufait , in one to two weeks ,
and with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Cederberg , in four to six weeks.

dilated cardiomyopathy and who was transferred from an outside hospital after
sutaining a right hip fracture. She had been in good health
until one day prior to admission to Storg Hospital
when she tripped over the carpet in her house and fell to the
ground and fractured her right hip. There was no loss of
consciousness or head trauma nor were there any preceding
symptoms such as chest pain , shortness of breath , or
palpitations. She has a history of osteoarthritis as well as
known bilateral hip insufficiency fractures for which she has
been evaluated in the past. She was transferred to O&apos;mead Hospital for orthopedic surgery.

ALLERGIES: The patient has a history of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia. Penicillin causes a rash.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile , 98.6 , pulse
115 , blood pressure 118/80 , respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen
saturation 95% on room air. She was a well-appearing lady in no
acute distress who rated her pain as 2/10 at rest and yet 8/10
upon movement of her lower extremities. On head and neck exam ,
her JVP was flat. Her oropharynx was without erythema or
exudates. Her lungs were clear bilaterally. On examination of
the heart , she had a regular rhythm and was tachycardic. S1 and
S2 were clearly audible. There was no rub or murmur or gallop.
Her abdominal exam was benign , and her extremities were warm and
without edema. Her right leg was shortened and externally
rotated.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION: Significant for sodium of 146 ,
potassium of 4.2 , chloride of 111 , bicarbonates of 24 , BUN 39 ,
creatinine 1.4 , PTT 26.2 , and INR 1.1.
Plain films of the hip revealed a nondisplaced right femoral
fracture.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Echocardiogram performed on
7/25/2006 revealed LVEF of 55-60% without wall motion
abnormality and no evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Her RV was
mildly enlarged , mild left atrial enlargement , no AR , and mild
TR. There was no aortic regurgitation , mild mitral
regurgitation , and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
Most recent right heart catheterization results performed in April
2006 showed normal right-sided filling pressures with a right
atrial pressure of 3 mmHg , RV 4 , PA 24 , and pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 9.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: In summary , Ms. Hilz is a
67-year-old female status post heart transplant in October 2006
who was stable from a
cardiac standpoint when she tripped and sustained a
right hip fracture. She was transferred from outside hospital in Ing Port for
surgical evaluation.
Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right hip fracture.
She went to the OR on hospital day #2 and received a dynamic hip
screw. The procedure was uncomplicated , and the patient was able
to begin weightbearing on postoperative day #1. She worked with
physical therapy and upon discharge was able to ambulate around
the Angeles with a walker. She should continue aspirin 325 mg daily
for four weeks after the surgery. There is no indication for
systemic anticoagulation after this particular procedure. She
will receive oxycodone as needed.
Cardiovascular: She is status post transplant with the last
echocardiogram revealing ejection fraction of 60%. She was
continued on her standard immunosuppressive medications. There
was no evidence of ischemia throughout the hospital stay. She
was euvolemic with no evidence of congestive heart failure. She was in sinus
rhythm on telemetry throughout her hospital stay.
Hematology: The patient has a history of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia. She was treated with fondaparinux daily prior
to the procedure and then discharged on aspirin for four weeks
postprocedure. Her hematocrit dropped from 33.5% to 24.9% after
the surgery. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells on the day after surgery with appropriate hematocrit rise.
She received additional 2 units of packed red blood cells prior
to discharge , and her hematocrit was 30.4% on the day of
discharge. Stools were guaiac negative , and it was thought that
his hematocrit drop was due to the postoperative blood loss as
well as potential hematoma formation at the site of the surgery.
Her hematocrit will be followed closely as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg every four hours as needed
for pain , aspirin 325 mg daily for four weeks after the surgery ,
Fosamax 70 mg weekly , Dulcolax p.r. 10 mg as needed for
constipation , Caltrate plus D one tablet daily , Neoral
( cyclosporine ) 150 mg b.i.d. , diltiazem extended release 360 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg daily ,
CellCept 1500 mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg every six hours as
needed for pain , Protonix 40 mg daily , Pravachol 40 mg daily ,
prednisone 8 mg every morning , and multivitamin one tablet daily.
FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient will continue her home medication
regimen. In addition , she should be maintained on aspirin 325 mg
for four weeks to prevent clot formation postsurgery. She should
take oxycodone as needed for pain. She has a followup
appointment with orthopedic surgery. The attending who performed
her procedure was Dr. Firkey . Her appointment is scheduled for
11/4/2006 at 09:15 a.m. She should followup with her primary
care doctor within 1-2 weeks of discharge and will also be
closely followed by transplant clinic. She was instructed to
have her blood drawn on Monday after discharge , 7/12/2006 , to be
reviewed by her primary care doctor.

Discharge Date: 3/10/1995
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 50 year old man with
unstable angina who was referred to
the Rhalca Medical Center for cardiac catheterization and
coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient has a four-year
history of coronary artery disease who presented with left-sided
chest pain four days prior to admission. He describes episodes of
chest pain occurring approximately q. two months as well as
evidence of shortness of breath although he has a noted picture of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ETT in 1989 was negative and he recently described progressively
poor exercise tolerance to the point that he was taking sublingual
NTG on a twice daily basis for exertional angina. One week prior
to admission he developed severe substernal chest discomfort at
rest , lasting approximately 10 minutes. Then , after taking a
sublingual NTG , he reported loss of consciousness for a duration of
20 to 30 seconds at which point he was taken to the Spena Hospital by
an EMT. At the clinic he received intravenous NTG , heparin and
Diltiazem.
An ETT Thallium demonstrated reperfusion abnormalities in the
inferior and anterior walls. He left the Ca Awythe Stosit Memorial Hospital AMA to see
his cardiologist on the 11th who referred him to the Troydale Health for elective catheterization. At the time of
presentation he denied chest pain or shortness of breath. Cardiac
risk factors are notably an 80-pack year smoking history , family
history of heart disease , hypercholesterolemia and non
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for history of interstitial lung
disease , hyperlipidemia , GE reflux , chronic bronchitis and
obstructive sleep apnea. MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT: Cardizem 120mg
p.o.b.i.d. , Mevacor 20mg p.o.b.i.d. , Pepcid 40mg p.o.q.d. , Ventolin
and Seldane taken on a prn basis. ALLERGIES: NKDA.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Six centimeters of JVD , normal cardiac
examination with intact distal pulses.
Diminished breath sounds bilaterally.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: Unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and underwent cardiac catheterization
demonstrating 80% distal stenosis of the left main as well as the
origin of the LAD with additional occlusion of the midportion of
the LAD and distal carotid , 80% stenosis of midportion of left
circumflex and proximal occlusion of the right coronary. Previous
pulmonary function tests performed in October included an FEV-1 of
2.53 , FEV-1/FVC of 83 , FVC 3.05. He was seen preoperatively by the
Dental Service. He was felt to have a possible periodontal abscess
of tooth #32 for which a course of p.o. penicillin was recommended
and completed.
On the 13 of November , the patient received double coronary artery bypass
graft including pedicle LIMA bypass to the LAD and LAD patch
angioplasty with a single aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft
to the obtuse marginal. He tolerated the procedure well. He was
admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit in routine
fashion without complications. He was stable in sinus rhythm. He
had a somewhat higher than normal O2 requirement which diminished
with diuresis.
His hospital course proceeded without complications although he did
demonstrate a low-grade fever and leukocytosis up to 20 , 000 for
which he was started on an empiric course of cefuroxime for
radiographic infiltrate although his sputum cultures were not
definitive. He was evaluated by the ID Service and cultured
appropriately with continuation of empiric antibiotics. He
continued to demonstate low-grade fevers during the course of his
hospital stay with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 14 to
16K prior to discharge. No definite source of infection was
identified.
All of his wound sites looked clean and cultures remained negative.
He was weaned off oxygen for some time. He had no productive
cough. On the 28 of November we discharged him to home AMA , although
encouraged a stay for further evaluation of his fever and
leukocytosis.
DISPOSITION: Aspirin 325mg q.d. , Diltiazem 120mg p.o.t.i.d. ,
Colace 100mg t.i.d. , iron sulfate 300mg t.i.d. , Lasix
80mg p.o.b.i.d. , Mevacor 20mg p.o.b.i.d. , MVI one p.o.q.d. ,
Percocet one to two tabs. q. 4 prn , KCl 40mil/eq p.o.b.i.d. and
ciprofloxacin 500mg p.o.b.i.d. X 10 days taken with clindamycin
300mg p.o.q.i.d. He was encouraged to see his cardiologist for
follow-up over the following week and should return to
Dr. Donnie Daidone office during this interval prior to completion
of his antibiotics.

OPERATIONS:
1. CABG x3 ( Y-graft sequential: LIMA connects aorta to LAD ,
sequential SVG1 connects LIMA to OM1 and then PDA )/left atrial
appendage resection.
2. Insertion of a pacemaker on 2/19/2006 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wagenblast is a 76-year-old man with
history of atrial fibrillation who is admitted to Et Monthilt Ria Hospital last month with atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. At that time , he also had arm pain and
pulmonary edema. This resolved once his heart rate was
controlled. He has had atrial fibrillation for the past 30 years
and has been on Coumadin for the past 20. The patient has been
on amiodarone therapy in the past and has biopsy-demonstrated
cirrhosis as a consequence of this therapy , which has resolved
following the discontinuation of the medication. He has been
rate controlled since that time but is very sensitive even with
slight delay in his rate-slowing medications with heart rate
becoming rapid associated with a sensation of aching in his arms.
He also has a history of peripheral vascular disease with
endarterectomy of the external iliac , common femoral , and TSA
with patch angioplasty on the left in April 2000 at RMH .  He
also has a cerebrovascular disease with MRI a few years ago also
showing evidence of old small infarcts involving the right
inferior cerebellum and the old lacuna in the left anterior pons
and some patchy areas of the bilateral pons , small areas of
ischemia. He was thought to have basilar artery disease by
neurology. He complains that right side is less sensitive to
temperatures and touch than the left side but no difference in
motor activities is noted. He also has a history of coronary
artery disease. As an outpatient , MIBI in September 2006 showed
1-mm ST depression but no ischemia on imaging. Left ventricular
ejection fraction was noted to be 45% without any regional wall
motion abnormalities. Elective catheterization showed
three-vessel disease and was admitted to the Carecog Hospital for CABG.
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS: Urgent. The patient presented with
critical coronary anatomy. There is a history of class III heart
failure. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.
PREVIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS: None.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , peripheral vascular disease
of the lower extremities , status post endarterectomy of the
external iliac , common femoral , and TSA with patchy angioplasty
on the left in April 2000 , diabetes mellitus with insulin
therapy , hypercholesterolemia , migraine headache , and bilateral
lower extremity neuropathy due to diabetes.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Surgery for a torn right rotator cuff ,
August 2006 , and as above.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father had a stroke.
SOCIAL HISTORY: History of tobacco use , cigarette smoking
history but quit smoking many years ago.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin - skin edema , quinidine - rash , and
amiodarone - cirrhosis of the liver.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Diltiazem 360 p.o. daily.
2. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily.

5. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.
6. Simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.
7. Metformin 500 mg b.i.d.
8. Insulin.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION DATA: Coronary anatomy: 95% mid LM , 60%
ostial LAD , 50% proximal circumflex , 100% proximal RCA , right
dominant circulation , and marginal diffuse 99%.
ECG: Atrial fibrillation at 90 beats per minute , nonspecific
intraventricular delay , Q-waves in V3 , poor R wave progression ,
precordial leads , and ST elevation in V2 and V3.
CHEST X-RAY: Normal , atherosclerotic aortic knob.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the intensive care
unit following an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft as
described above as well as a left atrial appendage resection.
His bypass time was 106 minutes with cross-clamp time of 61
minutes. One ventricular wire and one pericardial tube was
placed. A retrosternal tube and a right pleural tube were also
placed. Please see dictated operative note for details.
Following his operation , he was transferred to the ICU for
further care and management. The patient was extubated on
postoperative day #1 and was given supplemental O2 nasal cannula
at that time. On postoperative day #2 , the patient&apos;s chest tubes
were removed , and his pacing wires were left in place since the
patient was found to be asystolic as an underlying rhythm. The
patient remained in atrial fibrillation and alternated with sinus
rhythm with first-degree AV block. His atrial fibrillation was
difficult to control in the acute postoperative setting , and
cardiology consult was obtained for further care and management
of the patient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient had
shortness of breath and was given Lasix for diuresis. He was 2
liters negative on postoperative day #3 , though he was still
increased from his preoperative weight. His pacing wires were
discontinued on postoperative day #3 as the patient was found to
have return of his underlying rhythm. He was started on
Lopressor and on diltiazem at that time. On postoperative day
#4 , the patient&apos;s diltiazem was changed to diltiazem CD 360 mg
and atenolol 50 mg daily per Dr. Caffarel . The patient was
given a PT consult for home safety evaluation on that day. On
postoperative day #8 , the patient had an episode of symptomatic
sinus bradycardia and as a result received a transvenous
pacemaker by the electrophysiology service for the control of the
sinus bradycardia , and on the day of discharge from the ICU , the
patient was taken for permanent pacemaker placement by the
electrophysiology team.
The patient&apos;s pain was controlled with Tylenol without
significant pain requirement issues. He was intact
neurologically on day of discharge , moving all four extremities ,
and appropriate. From a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient
was given his pacemaker and was still in atrial fibrillation as
his underlying rhythm. He was given 50 of atenolol as well as
extended release of diltiazem 360 daily. He was on room satting
appropriately and was given Atrovent on a p.r.n. basis. He was
tolerating POs and getting Nexium and Colace from a GI
perspective. The patient was receiving diuresis with Lasix of 40
p.o. b.i.d. , and his electrolytes were supplemented. From a
hematologic standpoint , he was given aspirin 81 mg , and his
Coumadin will be restarted. He had no significant infectious
disease issues on the day of discharge. From endocrine
perspective , the patient was given NPH 24 units q.a.m. and 20
units q.p.m and his baseline sliding scale in addition to NovoLog
10 units as a standing order.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to the cardiac step-down
unit.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Good.
FOLLOWUP: The patient was instructed to follow up with his
attending physician , Dr. Darras , in 1-2 weeks following
discharge.

Discharge Date: 2/10/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ANGINA
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. Coronary artery disease
2. Hypertension
3. Non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 72 year old white male
Status post recent myocardial
infarction who was admitted for recurrent chest discomfort.
On the 17 of April , the patient noticed a &quot;uncomfortable chest
sensation&quot; as he was driving. He experienced diaphoresis at that
time , but no shortness of breath and no nausea or vomiting. He was
seen at an outside hospital and noted to have 2-3 mm ST elevations
in leads 2 , 3 , FV5 and V6 ( Humpde Hospital ). The patient was given
TPA , Heparin intravenous and aspirin. His peak CPK was noted to be
5 , 742 with an MB fraction of 199. The patient&apos;s hospital stay was
complicated by frequent PVCs on cardiac monitor , for which he was
temporarily treated with Lidocaine. Immediately after the TPA
infusion , the patient noted that his chest discomfort which was
located primarily on the left side , across the midline , to the
right. An echocardiogram that was performed , showed an ejection
fraction of 60% with posterolateral dyssynergia. On the 3 of July of
September , the patient was discharged from Cocku Health after a submax
ETT. He reached a heart rate of 95 and blood pressure 168/90.
On the 26 of September , the patient noted that he had a recurrence of
this vague chest discomfort as he was sitting and talking to
friends. He took a sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. This
chest discomfort episode resolved spontaneously after approximately
ten minutes.
On the 20 of May , the patient was at a party and , again ,
developed a similar anxious sensation which was similar to the
feeling that he experienced prior to his myocardial infarction. He
took two sublingual Nitroglycerin again , without relief , and his
discomfort resolved after two hours. Patient denies PND ,
orthopnea , or edema. The patient was admitted on the 20 of May
for cardiac catheterization to evaluate post myocardial infarction
angina.
ALLERGIES: Include Penicillin and Toprol which leads to an itch.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension for five to
six years and diet controlled diabetes
mellitus times four years.
ADMISSION MEDICINES: Ecotrin , Vasotec 20 mg po qd. Atenolol 50
mg po qd. Nitropatch which was to be
continued the day of admission.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has never smoked and he denies
alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died at the age of 48 with the
history of coronary artery disease. The mother
died at the age of 80 secondary to congestive heart failure. His
brother died of a myocardial infarction in his 60s.
ADMITTING PHYSICAL EXAM: BP 120/80. Heart rate 54. Temperature
97.2 , with 95% room air saturation.
Patient is a well-developed elderly male , lying in bed in no acute
distress. HEENT exam reveals pupils are equal , round , reactive to
light and accommodation , oropharynx is within normal limits. Neck
exam is supple with jugular venous pressure 4 cm and carotids
without bruits. Heart exam shows S1 and S2 with a positive S4 , 1/6
systolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border. Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam is benign with
positive bowel sounds , soft and non-tender and is non-distended.
Extremities exam shows no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , with +2
pulses bilaterally at the femoral deep tendon , and posterior tibial
sites. Rectal exam is guaiac negative. Neurological exam is
non-focal , with down-going toes bilaterally , and 2+ reflexes
bilaterally.
ADMISSION LAB: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 190 ,
bicarbonate 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.4 , glucose
183 , white count 9.3 , hematocrit 36 with platelets of 274 , CK 219 ,
LDH 407. Urinalysis negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm 55 , axis 20 , normal intervals , biphasic V4 through V6 and 1
mm ST elevation in V5 and V6. chest x-ray was within normal
limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The physical therapy was started on Heparin
immediately after admission for presumed post
myocardial infarction angina. He underwent cardiac catheterization
the morning following admission. This demonstrated a proximal 100%
occluded left circ lesion which was easily angio-positive to 20%
residual. This was complicated by a small dissection. An LV gram
demonstrated inferior hypokinesis. The patient tolerated the
procedure well without significant decrease in hematocrit or
increase in creatinine. He was heparinized for a full forty-eight
hours post cardiac catheterization procedure. At the time of
discharge , he was ambulating. At no time during this admission did
he develop chest discomfort.
The patient was discharged to home in good condition and will be
followed by his cardiologist in one week post discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg po qd. Atenolol 50 mg po
qd. Vasotec 20 mg po qd. Sublingual

HOSPITAL COURSE:
This 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including
morbid obesity , diabetes , CHF with diastolic dysfunction , and
chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetes is on home
nesiritide infusions and comes in with total body volume
overload. She was aggressively diuresed during this
hospitalization.
COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular:
1. Ischemia: The patient did not have any positive cardiac
enzymes and no evidence of ischemia. She was maintained on
aspirin , a beta-blocker , and a statin.
2. Pump: The patient was diuresed aggressively. She was
started on a continuous BNP drip along with Lasix 160 mg IV
b.i.d. plus metolazone as needed to help diurese approximately 1
liter per day. The patient did not respond to p.o. Lasix. The
patient was variably responsive to diuretics , but at the time of
discharge , had diuresed down the 130.3 kg a drop of approximately
10 kg or approximately 22 pounds. The patient&apos;s BNP at the time
of discharge was 8 and she was not felt to be in heart failure.
She continued to have lower extremity edema that was felt likely
secondary to venous stasis and lack of mobilization. Therefore ,
she was encouraged to mobilize and given compression stockings to
help mobilize the fluid in her legs. At the time of discharge ,
she was diuresing well to oral Bumex and she was maintained on
Bumex in order to keep her ins and outs even each days.
3. Rhythm: The patient did not have issues from a rhythm
perspective.
Renal: The patient had a creatinine that climbed as high as 5.8 ,
during her hospitalization. She was felt to have an underlying
diabetic nephropathy. The Renal Service ( Dr. Courtney Sissom ) was
consulted and felt that the patient would likely eventually need
outpatient dialysis , however , there was no emergent indication
for dialysis at this time. The patient has seen Dr. Hilton V Sheaks , at Fullfirst , Vascular Surgery prior to
this for consideration of a fistula placement and she will
continue to follow up with Dr. Sauberan following discharge.
Hematology: The patient was maintained on Coumadin for her
history of a clot in the right and left superficial femoral vein ,
which was diagnosed in 4/9 and was noted to be extending
towards the deep venous system. The patient was also continued
on iron for her underlying anemia.
Endocrine: The patient had diabetes and was maintained on her
NPH plus a regular insulin sliding scale to control her blood
sugars and her blood sugars were reasonably well controlled and
generally below 200.
Musculoskeletal: The patient was complaining of increasing
cramps in her calves a few days prior to discharge. Therefore ,
lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound tests were repeated and
these ruled out recurrent deep venous thrombosis. A CK was
checked and this was normal and therefore , it was felt that the
patient did not have any evidence of rhabdomyolysis or a
compartment syndrome. It was felt that these pains were most
likely secondary to venous pooling in the legs combined with
inactivity. The patient was treated symptomatically with
oxycodone and encouraged to ambulate to help mobilize the fluid
out of her legs.
FINAL MEDICATIONS:
The final medications will be dictated at the time of discharge.

ATTENDING: LACINSKI , OLLIE WARNER MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Status post fall.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with
severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic PEs , OSA ,
gout , bilateral hip replacements who presents with two falls in
the past two days. The day prior to admission , the patient fell
while he was standing at the sink. He has poor recall of events
but thinks he landed on his leg. On the day of admission , he
fell after getting out of the shower. He grabbed a chair , but
slipped and landed on his buttocks , then he fell backwards and
hit the back of his head. He denies any loss of consciousness.
EMS was called and brought him to the Emergency Department. He
did note a brief episode of chest pain after the fall. He says he is compliant
with his medication regimen and denies dietary indiscretion.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems also notable for complaints
of more labored breathing , increased swelling , especially in the
left lower extremity as well as worsening orthopnea over the past
several days. He uses BiPAP at home at baseline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for pulmonary hypertension ,
last catheterization was in September 2005 , which showed no
obstructive lesions , PASP of 104. He has OSA and is on BiPAP , he has
history of DVTs , history of lower extremity ulcers and cellulitis ,
hypertriglyceridemia , gout , hypertension , obesity. He is status
post bilateral hip replacement as well as knee
replacement.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Versed.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives in Chuhern Boulevard , Tra Berke Call , North Dakota 02692 part of the year and owns a car
dealership. No tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: He was afebrile , heart rate
94 , blood pressure 126/60 , 92% on room air. Head atraumatic , no
nuchal rigidity. JVP was 10. Lungs were clear with distant
breath sounds. Cardiovascular exam: Tachycardic with a loud S2.
Extremities showed swelling over the right wrist without warmth.
Lower extremities had brawny skin changes bilaterally with
2+ edema in the legs to the mid shin. Neuro exam: cranial nerves
II-XII were grossly intact. He had 4/5 strength at the left hip flexor ,
5/5 otherwise in the lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Included a hematocrit of 58.7
within the patient&apos;s baseline of 53 to 58 , creatinine of 1 , INR
4.4 , troponin 0.04. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left
atrial enlargement and right atrial enlargement. Head CT was
negative. Plain films of the pelvis were negative for fracture.
Hardware was in place. Right wrist showed no fracture , but did
show erosive changes suggestive of crystal deposition.
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema. Additional studies
included a repeat head CT , which was again negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: In summary , this is a 61-year-old
gentleman with a history of pulmonary history of hypertension and
chronic PEs on anticoagulation who presents after falls in the
setting of worsening lower extremity edema as well as orthopnea.
CARDIAC: ISCHEMIA: he was ruled out for MI. His last
catheterization was negative in September 2005. He was continued
on his beta-blocker and he was anticoagulated on Coumadin.
PUMP: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension. The
PVMC team followed this patient carefully. He was diuresed
with a daily goal of negative 500 to 1 L with IV Lasix once
or twice a day as needed. His home dose of Lasix is 160 mg p.o. He responded
very well to two doses of 160 mg IV twice per day , but this was titrated down
to 160 once a day given the goal of keeping the patient approximately 500 mL to
1 L negative per day to minimize fluid and electrolyte shifts. His weight on
admission was 440 pounds. At discharge ,
his weight was 429. His dry weight according to his primary
cardiologist&apos;s notes suggest a dry weight of 419 pounds. He was
otherwise maintained on his home regimen of Procardia ,
hydrochlorothiazide , Revatio , and Toprol. He will need to follow
up with Dr. Santor , his cardiologist , on 3/10/07 .
2. Rhythm: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm. He did have
an episode of missed beats , likely Wenckebach on 7/20/07 as well
as some ectopy. These were thought secondary to fluid shifts.
His electrolytes were thus repleted aggressively and he was
monitored on telemetry.
3. Pulmonary: His baseline room air oxygen saturation was
90-93%. He should use oxygen as treatment for his pulmonary
hypertension. He should also be provided with oxygen at home
when he is discharged. Chest x-ray was clear. In addition , he
uses BiPAP at night and this should be continued while he is at
rehabilitation and after he is discharged.
4. Heme: The patient has a history of DVT with PEs. He is on
Coumadin with an INR goal of 2.5. Initially , he was
supertherapeutic on admission , but his regimen was restarted after holding 2
doses. Of note , on 7/21 , he did miss a dose of Coumadin inadvertently , but
he should be continued on his home regimen , which is 11 mg on
Monday , Wednesday and Friday and 12 mg the other days of the
week. In addition , because of the patient&apos;s asymmetric lower
extremity edema , LENIS were obtained and were negative. The
patient&apos;s elevated hematocrit was likely secondary to pulmonary
hypertension and hypoxia and was within his baseline.
5. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was
maintained on K and mag scales. He was also on a 2 L fluid
restriction. The patient refused a cardiac diet; however , he was
willing to accept a diet that was had no added salt.
6. Neurologic: The patient&apos;s neuro exam was completely
nonfocal. He had a repeat head CT , which was also negative.
This was on 4/20/07 .
7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was seen by Physical Therapy.
He was treated for his hip pain initially with oxycodone. This
was changed to Dilaudid for better pain control. He said that he
would like to be changed back to his home dose of oxycodone when
he is discharged , as he feels the Dilaudid is fairly strong.
X-rays were negative for any fracture.
8. Rheumatological: The patient has a history of gout. This
appeared to be exacerbated with diuresis. His gouty pain was
initially in his right wrist. He also describes pain in his
right knee. He is on his home doses of allopurinol and
colchicine. Indocin was added and at discharge , the patient had
received two days of Indocin. We would like him to receive a
total of three days of Indocin. Tylenol and narcotics as
previously described can be used to help with his gouty pain.
9. GI: The patient takes Nexium at home and he was continued on
Prilosec while an inpatient. He should be switched back to
Nexium when he is discharged from rehabilitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: At discharge , the patient was
afebrile. His blood pressure was between 110-140 over 66-80 ,
heart rate is between 76 and 87. His room air saturation was 91%
on room air. He was breathing very comfortably and complained
only of right wrist pain. His lungs were clear. JVP is less
than 10. His cardiac exam was tachy with a regular rhythm and a
loud S2.
LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE: Include a creatinine of 1 and
include a hematocrit of 53.1 and INR of 2.3. Potassium was 3.9
and magnesium was 2.0.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to rehab.
FOLLOWUP: He should follow up with his cardiologist , Dr.
Insco . He also has an appointment scheduled with
Endocrinology in the near future.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 11 mg Monday , Wednesday and
Friday and 12 mg nightly on Tuesdays , Thursdays , Saturday and
Sunday , Diovan 320 a day , multivitamin 1 tab daily , Toprol-XL 50
once a day , nifedipine extended release 30 once a day , Revatio 20

===================================================
ASSESSMENT:
75 yo F with h/o AS , SSS s/p PM , DM2 , restrictive lung disease presenting
with acute onset of cough , fever , and worsening shortness of breath over
the past three days.
Pt has a long history of SOB and recently several episodes of falls
managed by her PCP , cardiologist , and pulmonologist. Workup has thus far
been negative for cardiac causes including new arrhythmias ,
malfunctioning pacemaker or worsening AS per echo done 8/18/07 at ASCRH .
Elective cath done on 10/15/07 at TMC showed minimal CAD. The most
recent visit to her pulmonolgist two months ago revealed stable pulmonary
function. Recent CXRs done at SBH suggest there may be a component of
pulmonary edema , her presentation at this admission not consistent with
worsening pulmonary edema from heart failure of valvular disease.
An atypical presenation for MI was also ruled out by enzymes.
Given her acute onset of cough with a fever , the most likely etiology is
infectious exacerbated by her poor pulmonary reserve.
=============================================
HOSPITAL COURSE:
--------------
1 ) PULMONARY: Pt kept on ceftriaxone and azithromycin despite a negative
CXR and chest PT because of concern for CAP in pt with poor pulmonary
reserve. Presentation most consistent with a viral etiology. Symptoms
responded well to duonebs and robitussin prn. On HD#2 , patient&apos;s
breathing markedly improved and was able to wean off of O2 able to sat
95% on room air. Pt was able to ambulate on room air without dropping O2
saturation below 90%. Patient was d/c to home on azithromycin and
albuterol inhaler.
2 ) CV: Cariac enzymes were negative. Patient was kept on her home
regimen of ASA , toprol , lisinopril , hctz.
3 ) DM2: Oral meds were held on admission and pt switched to NPH +
prandial aspart.
4 ) FEN: low fat , low cholesterol diet , K/Mg scales. Tolerated PO&apos;s
5 ) Ppx: DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox 40 mg sc qd.

Discharge Date: 8/25/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ANEURYSM REPAIR.
AUTOMATIC IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER
DEFIBRILLATOR PATCH PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old white
female , status post large anterior
myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular tachycardia ,
ventricular fibrillation arrest and aneurysm , admitted for surgical
repair and AICD ( automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator )
placement. The patient&apos;s cardiac risk factors included
hypertension , increased cholesterol , adult-onset diabetes mellitus ,
positive family history , positive previous myocardial infarction.
Her cardiac course was notable for a large anterior myocardial
infarction on 2 of November .  The patient received recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator and underwent emergent percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty. A left ventriculogram showed
anterior septal dyskinesis and ejection fraction was approximately
20%. The patient had postoperative tamponade requiring
pericardiocentesis. On 2 of November , the patient suffered worsening
congestive heart failure , tachyarrhythmia and required emergent
cardioversion and subsequent medical therapy. She had recurrent
ventricular tachycardia treated with Lidocaine. In 17 of March ,
electrophysiologic studies were performed and the patient was
started on Amiodarone. The patient also underwent transplant
evaluation with cardiac catheterization showing occluded left
anterior descending coronary artery at S1 , right dominant system ,
marked left ventricular dilatation with anterior septal dilatation
and ejection fraction 18%. Right atrial pressures were 60/12/11 ,
right ventricular pressures 56/14 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 34 , cardiac index 31. An echocardiogram showed left
atrium 4.9 centimeters , left ventricle with normal wall thickness ,
plus thrombus and mild pericardial effusion , anterior septal
akinesis , hypokinetic left ventricle , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,
2+ mitral regurgitation. The patient was admitted at this time for
aneurysm repair. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed coronary artery
disease as above , hiatal hernia , adult-onset diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , status post total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , status post appendectomy , status
post cholecystectomy. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Micronase
5 milligrams by mouth each day , Amiodarone 200 milligrams by mouth
each day , captopril 37.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,
Coumadin 2 milligrams by mouth each day. ALLERGIES were to
Halcion , which causes hallucinations. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the
patient is married with 5 children , 7 grandchildren.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a pleasant ,
middle-aged , white female in no acute
distress. The patient was afebrile , blood pressure 98/60 ,
temperature 98 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation on room air
was 92%. Skin was without lesions. Head , eyes , ears , nose and
throat examination was within normal limits. Neck was supple
without lymphadenopathy , carotids 2+ without bruits , no jugular
venous distention. Chest examination was significant for rales
about 1/3 of the way up from the bases. Cardiac examination
revealed S1 and S2 , positive S3 , II/VI systolic murmur was heard at
the left upper sternal border radiating to the apex. Abdomen was
soft , nontender , nondistended , no organomegaly. Extremities
revealed 2+ pitting edema. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Rectal examination revealed normal tone , guaiac negative stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray on admission revealed
cardiomegaly , left pleural effusion versus
scarring , mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. The
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , left atrial
enlargement , low voltages , no change compared to old study of
previous admission. Other laboratory data on admission was
unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10 of March , to the
Surgery Service and the procedure was performed
on 29 of January .  Please see the operation note for description of the
aneurysmectomy and AICD patch placement. The patient was managed
postoperatively on the Surgical Service without complications , and
transferred to the Medical Service 2 days prior to discharge. On
the Medical Service , treatment included removal of the patient&apos;s
chest tube , removal of her pacing wires , and captopril was
increased to a final dose of 37.5 milligrams.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE included Coumadin 2 milligrams by mouth
each day , Bactrim-Double-Strength 1 by mouth twice a day times 6
days , Amiodarone 200 milligrams by mouth each day , Micronase 5
milligrams by mouth each day , captopril 37.5 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was
to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Shad Bozard in 4 weeks , and with Dr. Royce M. J Stockham . The patient was to have her prothrombin time and partial
thromboplastin time checked at her local Coumadin Clinic.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
( 2 ) HYPERTENSION
( 3 ) OBESITY
( 4 ) DIABETES , INSULIN REQUIRING
( 5 ) DEPRESSION
( 6 ) GOUT
( 7 ) CHRONIC HEARING LOSS
( 8 ) HISTORY OF CHOLECYSTECTOMY AND APPENDECTOMY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with insulin requiring diabetes
mellitus , hypertension , and known coronary artery disease who
presented on the day of admission after having a fall at home. She
was noted in the emergency room to have new ECG changes. The
patient was recently catheterized in October of 1998 at which time
she was found to have a 100% left anterior descending artery
lesion , a 100% right coronary artery lesion , and a 40% obtuse
marginal 1 lesion. Her left anterior descending artery and right
coronary artery territories were being served by collaterals and
the decision was made to manage her medically on enteric coated
aspirin , Atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg q.d. , and Pravacid
at 20 mg q.d. Her Bumex dose was recently increased from 1 to 2
q.d. on 1/12/98 . She was recently admitted from 11/7/98 to 8/10/98
for increasing shortness of breath and some chest pain and had
catheterization with results as described above. She was
discharged to home on an increase in her medical regimen. Her last
echocardiogram was done in February of 1997 and this showed a
moderately dilated left ventricle with septal akinesis , inferior
hypokinesis , and an ejection fraction of 35%. Her right
ventricular size and function were normal. There was mild left
atrial enlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , and trivial aortic insufficiency. Since discharge
she has been followed in Tauershingdeneers Hospital by Dr.
Goodfield , as well as by Dr. Adamyan of cardiology. Her Bumex dose as
described above was increased on 1/12/98 because of fluid overload.
Of note , she has had very poor glycemic control over the two months
prior to admission with blood sugars in the 300 to 400 range. Her
last A1C was 12.3 on 1/12/98 . It had been 6.0 on 9/20/97 . On the
day of admission after standing up to get her insulin , she felt
lightheaded and fell backwards , landing on her coccyx into a chair
but the chair fell backwards and so she fell backwards as well.
She reported that for two or three days prior to admission she had
been having some lightheadedness. She denied any visual changes or
weakness , loss of consciousness or head injury. She denied any
seizure or seizure history or loss of urine. She was unable to get
up and called for help and an ambulance brought her to the
emergency room department.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She reported occasional diarrhea and
constipation. She had no fever or chills. No
cough. No urinary symptoms. She also denied any dietary
indiscretion or non-compliance with her insulin. She reports that
she has chest pain approximately two times per week but denied
having any chest pain on the day of admission.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg
q.d. , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg q.d. ,
Bumex 2 mg q.d. since 1/12/98 , Pravastatin 20 mg q.d. , Omeprazole
20 mg q.d. , insulin NPH 75 q.a.m. and 35 q.p.m. , regular 25 q.a.m.
and 15 q.p.m. , Trazadone 100 mg qhs p.r.n. , Allegra 60 mg b.i.d. ,
Proventil 2 b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as noted above.
Hypertension. Obesity. Insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus. Depression. Gout. Chronic hearing loss
requiring hearing aids bilaterally. History of cholecystectomy
and appendectomy in past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone and has a visiting nurse.
She use to work in housekeeping at the
Mo Dessimed Memorial Hospital .  She has a remote history of
smoking but does not drink any alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an obese woman in no acute distress.
Temperature 98.3 degrees , pulse 95 , blood
pressure 109/63. Her room air saturation was 95%. She was not
orthostatic. HEENT: Unremarkable. Jugular venous distension
difficult to assess because of her habitus. Heart: Regular rate
and rhythm. S1 and S2 distant. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Lungs clear with exception of question of some rales at bases.
This was also difficult to assess due to poor inspiratory effort.
Abdomen: Benign. Extremities: 1+ edema at feet only.
Neurologic: Nonfocal. The patient was an appropriate historian
but had difficulty hearing some of the questions.
LABORATORY DATA: Normal set of electrolytes with BUN 58 ,
creatinine 2.4. Blood sugar 435. Anion gap 16.
Arterial blood gas on room air: pH 7.4 , pCO2 40 , pO2 69 , oxygen
saturation 94%. The first CK done in the emergency room department
was 194. An ACE test was positive but beta hydroxybutyrate was
negative with triponin of 0. WBC 7 , hematocrit 37 , platelet count
167. Coagulase was within normal limits. Urinalysis was
remarkable for 3+ glucose with no ketones , 1+ esterace , negative
nitrite , 20 to 25 white blood cells , 2 to 3 red blood cells , 2+
bacteria , and 1+ yeast. Urine culture was sent and came back
negative. ECG was normal sinus rhythm at rate of 92 with intervals
of 0.15 , 0.1 , and 0.324 , an axis of 32 , and left atrial
enlargement. There were new T-wave inversions in leads 1 and L
with biphasic T-waves in V4 through V6 compared with her ECG of
4/13/97 .
ASSESSMENT: In short , this is a 65 year old woman with known two
vessel coronary artery disease , hypertension , and
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus under poor glycemic control
recently , now presenting with hyperglycemia , dehydration , and new
ECG changes suggestive of lateral ischemia. She was admitted for
rule out of myocardial infarction and monitoring.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted and
placed on a cardiac monitor. She ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzymes and her ECG continued to show new
lateral T-wave changes. There was no evolution or change in these
throughout the course of the admission. On 10/22/98 the patient
underwent a Dobutamine MIBI study after discussion with her primary
care physician and cardiologist , Dr. Ginkel , who felt that this
would be a helpful study , given her difficult history and known
underlying coronary artery disease. The results of the Dobutamine
study were that she had no ECG changes and the MIBI images showed
lateral and inferior infarcts but no active ischemia.
Over the course of the first couple of days of the admission , the
patient&apos;s blood pressure was noted to be lower than her usual
baseline. Her diuretics were held with the thought that her
elevated creatinine , lightheadedness , and general malaise were
probably due to dehydration , given that her Bumex dose had recently
been increased. She was gently hydrated with a total of about 3
liters and her blood pressure increased somewhat. A follow-up
chest x-ray was done which did not show any evidence of congestive
heart failure. The patient had no other active cardiac issues
during this admission.
Renal: At the time of the admission the patient&apos;s creatinine was
2.5. It subsequently bumped to a maximum of 2.9 in the setting of
her dehydration. Her blood pressure medications were held and she
was gently rehydrated. With this treatment , her creatinine
returned to its baseline of approximately 1.5 to 1.6. At the time
of admission there was some question as to whether she might have a
urinary tract infection given her urinalysis; however , a urine
culture came back negative. The white blood cells in her urine on
admission were not present on a subsequent specimen which was
obtained by straight catheterization and the thought was that the
initial pyuria was probably related to vaginal candidiasis.
Pulmonary: Over the course of the first three or four days of
admission , the patient developed a somewhat increasing oxygen
requirement for unclear reasons. Her need for oxygen waxed and
waned but , because of her habitus and her general complaints of
dyspnea over the last several months , there was some concern that
she may be having chronic pulmonary embolus. For this reason she
was taken to VQ scan on 1/18/98 . This study was read as low
probability. She was transiently anticoagulated while awaiting the
results of the scan but the heparin was subsequently discontinued.
The reasons for her increase in oxygen requirement during the
course of this admission remained somewhat unclear. It is possible
that she has sleep apnea given her body habitus and this would
warrant follow-up as an outpatient. Her oxygen saturation at the
time of discharge is approximately 92% on room air.
Endocrine: At the time of admission the patient had blood sugars
in the range of 400 to 500. Her insulin doses were increased in
order to obtain better glycemic control. The reason for her sudden
increase in insulin needs remains elusive.
Orthopedics: At the time of the admission the patient had a set of
lumbosacral spine films done in order to rule out injuries related
to her fall. The films were read as showing a potential subtle
fracture of the coccyx. The patient had a significant amount of
pain in this area over the course of admission and it was thought
likely that she did , indeed , have a fracture. She has been working
with physical therapy in order to increase her mobility.
Gastrointestinal: The patient had been complaining over this
admission of some burning in her esophagus , as well as some
epigastric tenderness. It seems from review of her records that
this has been a chronic problem. She was started on Cisapride for
presumptive element of diabetic gastroparesis , in addition to being
maintained on her Prilosec. Of note , she had recently undergone
endoscopy and been diagnosed with a question of Helicobacter pylori
infection which has now been treated. However , her symptoms
continue. In addition , she had recently had a barium study in April
of 1996 that showed no abnormalities. It was decided that this
study did not warrant repeating at this point.
Neurologic: On several occasions during this admission the patient
became acutely confused. At these times she was not noted to have
a focal neurological examination. These instances appeared
questionably related to dosing of her Compazine and also all seemed
to occur in the evening. It was thought that she was probably
sundowning and , during her clearer moments , she reported having
similar problems at home.
Infectious disease: The patient began having some low grade fevers
on approximately hospital day #4. Blood and urine cultures at that
time were negative. Because of the low grade fevers and her
decreased oxygen saturation intermittently , chest x-ray and VQ scan
were done. The VQ scan was read as low probability. The chest
x-ray was read as having some atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
There was a question of whether this was atelectasis versus an
infiltrate. However , since the patient remained with a normal WBC
and no purulent sputum , it was thought unlikely that she had
pneumonia. She also reported having some congestion and it was
thought that she might be having low grade fevers from a upper
respiratory infection.

Discharge Date: 11/3/2007
ATTENDING: CRISTOBAL , DAMION MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CAD status post cardiac catheterization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 68-year-old male with history of
CAD status post three-vessel CABG , hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , COPD who had an episode of chest pain one week
prior to admission , presenting with left arm tingling that
resolved after 1 sublingual nitro. Later , on 10/18/2007 , his
blood pressure was noted to be in systolic blood pressure range
of 220s , was asymptomatic. Called his PCP and was told to go to
the hospital. Since 10/18/2007 was in the ED observation
section , had completed a rule out MI , which was negative for MI ,
and had undergone a stress MIBI on 7/1/2007 which showed
reversible area of septal ischemia. The patient was admitted for
further workup.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , hep C with a negative viral load
after interferon and RBV treatment , hyperlipidemia , renal artery
stenosis status post renal stenting , functional quadriplegic due
to motor vehicle accident in the past , TIA in 1975 status post
left carotid endarterectomy , left common iliac artery angioplasty
in 1994 , CABG 3-vessel 11/26 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Toprol-XL 12.5 daily , Lipitor , Atrovent ,
aspirin 81 mg daily , Prevacid , thiamine , multivitamin , Valium ,
Neurontin.
ALLERGIES: Baclofen and Bactrim.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , vital signs were stable , in no
apparent distress , no JVD. Lungs were clear. Regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Soft , nontender , and
nondistended. No lower extremity edema , chest x-ray was
unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: A 68-year-old male with history of CAD status
post three-vessel CABG , hypertension , peripheral vascular
disease , admitted for workup of chest pain , ruled out for MI. An
exercise stress test that showed evidence of reversible ischemia.
The patient was admitted for further workup and cardiac
catheterization.
1. CAD. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed three-vessel CAD with patent grafts to the right
circumflex and LAD. Proximal LAD to diagonals were not bypassed.
The decision was made by the clinical team and the referring
physician for further medical management controlling blood
pressure and return for repeat cardiac catheterization PCI of the
protected left main , approximately the two diagonals if symptoms
recur. The patient was continued on aspirin , statin ,
beta-blocker and lisinopril was started. The patient had no
evidence of heart failure. He had an echo in September of 2006 which
showed preserved ejection fraction. The patient had been
admitted on hydrocortisone which had been started secondary to
anomic dysfunction. Given that the patient presented with severe
hypertension the fludrocortisone was discontinued. His blood
pressure was titrated by adding lisinopril to his regimen.
During his hospitalization , the patient was monitored on tele and
no events were noted.
2. GI. The patient was continued on his Prevacid for GERD.
3. Neuro. The patient was continued on Neurontin for
neuropathic pain.
4. Psych. The patient had several episodes of confusion during
the evening slightly thought to be due to sundowning that
worsened after he got Ambien for insomnia. Per the family , the
patient has had several episodes of confusion and paranoia during
prior hospitalizations. During these episodes the patient was
alert and oriented x3 but exhibited paranoid behavior. Chest
x-ray and urinalysis were sent to rule out infectious process
actually to explain his confusion and these were unremarkable.
The patient was treated with Seroquel 25 mg nightly p.r.n. in the
short-term for sundowning which he responded well to.
5. Pulmonary. History of COPD , was stable during this
hospitalization and continued on his home regimen.
6. Renal. The patient was pretreated with Mucomyst and
bicarbonate pre and post cardiac catheterization.
7. FEN. The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet and
electrolytes were repeated as needed. The patient&apos;s code status
is full code during this hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Atrovent inhaler 2 puffs
q.i.d. , Prevacid 30 mg daily , lisinopril 5 mg daily , Toprol-XL 25
mg daily , MiraLax 17 grams p.o. daily p.r.n. constipation ,
Seroquel 25 mg p.o. bedtime p.r.n. for agitation , Zocor 20 mg
daily , and thiamine 100 mg daily.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
1. Follow up blood pressure and titrate medications as needed.
2. Optimize medical management of CAD , diagnostic results showed
3-vessel CAD , with patent grafts , proximal LAD and two diagonals
are not bypassed. Decision is for medical management. If the
patient continues to experience symptoms , further consideration
for a repeat cardiac catheterization and PCI if necessary.
3. The patient was complaining of chronic blurry vision which he
had prior to this hospitalization; we recommend further follow up
with ophthalmology as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 10/11/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. PROBLEM LIST
INCLUDES:
1 ) HYPERTENSION.
2 ) ASTHMA.
3 ) DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73 year old gentleman with a
past medical history of hypertension
who presented to Dr. Burch at the Collstate on
9/1/94 after a couple of episodes of heavy diaphoresis and
nausea , an identifiable precipitant. His EKG there revealed new T
wave inversions in the inferior leads and he was admitted to the
Rexas&amp; Hospital where he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
While at Hanghab Medical Center , his EKG alternated between left anterior
hemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. In addition , he had
further episodes of nausea and diaphoresis. Because of his
baseline conduction system disease , an exercise tolerance test
could not be performed and the patient was sent for an exercise
tolerance test thallium. However , prior to the test , the patient
became diaphoretic and nauseous with a non-palpable blood pressure.
He was treated with an intravenous fluid bolus with subsequent
improvement. Because he was felt too unstable to undergo a nuclear
imaging , he was transferred to the Hend Losblan Care to
undergo cardiac catheterization. The patient denied any paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , or peripheral edema. He also denied
any recent change in exercise tolerance. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for a history of rectal fissure , a small bowel
obstruction , microhematuria of uncertain etiology despite an
extensive work-up , diverticulosis , and hemorrhoids. He also has a
history of degenerative joint disease and a history of mild asthma.
His coronary risk factors include hypertension , obesity , gender ,
and age. ALLERGIES: None. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Calan SR 240
p.o. q.d. , Beconase two puffs b.i.d. , Brethaire two puffs q.i.d. ,
Azmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Feldene 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and Aspirin
one p.o. q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This was a well-developed pleasant male in
no apparent distress with a blood pressure
of 154/82 , heart rate 74 , and respirations 14. HEENT:
Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation , extraocular movements intact , and
oropharynx was benign. NECK: Supple with no jugular venous
distention and he had a left carotid bruit , however , his carotid
upstrokes were normal. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC: Examination revealed a very quiet precordium with a
regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops , or rubs.
EXTREMITIES: Revealed femoral pulses 2+ without bruits , dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial pulses 1+ bilaterally , and he had no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a sodium of 140 , a
potassium of 4.4 , BUN of 28 , creatinine
1.7 , glucose of 110 , white count was 6.4 , hematocrit was 47.6 ,
platelets were 137 , 000 , his PT was 13.6 , and his PTT was 47.3. His
chest X-Ray at Andsi Medical Center revealed an enlarged heart with
no pulmonary infiltrates , his EKG from 3/6/94 at the Massbarre County Memorial Hospital revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 , left posterior
hemi-block with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay , and
poor R wave progression across his precordium. He had deep T wave
inversion in III and F , this EKG was also notable for a pattern of
alternating conduction delay with alternating pattern of left
anterior and left posterior hemi-block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization
on 10/16/94 which revealed hemodynamics of a
right atrial mean of 6 , a right ventricular pressure of 28/6 , a
pulmonary capillary mean pressure of 14 , he had a totally occluded
mid left anterior descending lesion , a tight second diagonal
lesion , a totally occluded OM1 lesion , and a 70% distal right
coronary artery lesion. His left ventriculogram revealed
anteroapical hypokinesis. On further analysis of the patient&apos;s
EKG , it was felt that he alternated between left anterior
hemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. It was felt that his
symptoms may be an indication of more advanced conduction system
disease that would possibly justify a pacer. At this point , the
decision was to monitor the patient with Holter monitoring and to
perform a stress MIBI examination to assess if he degenerated to
more severe conduction disease. Holter monitoring on 1/6
revealed sinus rhythm between 40 and 85 , he had 14 hours of
occasional atrial premature beats , two hours of occasional
ventricular premature beats , each lasting less than a minute , as
well as intermittent intraventricular conduction delay. He had no
symptoms during the 24 hours of Holter monitoring. He exercise
tolerance test MIBI examination revealed a modified Bruce protocol
on which he went twelve minutes stopping secondary to leg fatigue ,
he had no chest pain , his maximum heart rate was 112 , his maximum
blood pressure was 195/95 , he had no change in his baseline EKG as
well as no ST changes , and no arrhythmias. His MIBI evaluation
revealed a fixed inferior defect extending to the posterior septum.
Given the above information , particularly the fact that the patient
did not degenerate to more severe conduction system disease with
exercise , it was felt that a pacer would not be necessary at this
time. Moreover , the patient had no provokeable ischemia by MIBI
evaluation and it was felt that revascularization was unnecessary.
The decision then was to send the patient home on an adequate
medical regimen which was achieved during his hospital course via
the addition of Captopril to his medical regimen to provide him
with adequate blood pressure control. It is noteworthy that the
patient had no episodes of nausea or diaphoresis during his
hospitalization , that is ambulating without assistance with no
symptoms whatsoever. He is therefore felt to be stable for
discharge and is being discharged to home.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Cardiac catheterization on 10/16/94
with complications none.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Verapamil SR 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ocean Spray two
puffs inhaler b.i.d. , Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Beconase two puffs
inhaler q.i.d. , Ventolin two puffs inhaler q.i.d. , and Azmacort
four puffs inhaler b.i.d. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. The
patient is being discharged to home for follow-up with Dr. Patricia G Palenzuela on Berke in Arl Pringcori Ton in one week&apos;s time.

Briefly again , this is an 81-year-old gentleman with a history of
coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft ,
here with gradual onset over the past month of increased lower
extremity swelling and increased dyspnea on exertion. He had no
prior episode. He sleeps on one pillow. He is able to walk 3/10
of one mile without difficulty. The patient is only able to walk
up one flight of stairs , but with some difficulty today secondary
to shortness of breath. The patient noted low grade fever since
ten days ago to about 100.5. The patient denied any chills. The
patient denied any abdominal and there was no nausea , vomiting or
diarrhea. The patient recently began antibiotics after a dental
procedure and was recently worked up for a left greater than right
lower extremity swelling one week ago with negative ultrasound
work-up of his lower extremities.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to codeine , reaction unknown.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient
was on Coumadin , Micronase , and baby
aspirin.

ASSESSMENT: This is an 81-year-old gentleman with known coronary
artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass
graft , presenting with low grade fevers and right greater than left
congestive heart failure.
PLAN:
1. Diuresis , aggressively.
2. Repletion of electrolytes when diuresing.
3. Cardiac monitoring , telemetry , and rule out myocardial
infarction.
4. Work-up for etiology of right congestive heart failure.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data at the time of discharge revealed
sodium 137 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 95 , bicarb
30 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 154 , calcium 9.4 , magnesium

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on aspirin , captopril 50 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Colace , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q. day , and
Timoptic.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Cardiovascular: The goal heart rate and blood pressure were
achieved. The goal heart rate was in the 70s-80s
with a blood pressure in the 110s-130s systolic. The patient was
diuresed over 10 kilograms and diuresed about 1-2 liters daily.
The patient was stable on p.o. Lasix regimen. After diuresis , the
patient underwent an adenosine MIBI for work-up of his ischemic
disease. Results were pending at the time of this dictation.
Also , the patient underwent a chest CT scan to rule out pulmonary
embolism , which was negative. The patient was discharged in stable
condition on April , 2001 without complications. Of note , the
patient did undergo a fall , likely related to decreased blood
pressure while in the hospital. He sustained no injury and the
fall was recorded by the nurses in the incident report. Again ,
there were no traumatic complications of this.

Discharge Date: 6/2/2006
ATTENDING: LEVERSON , WESTON M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Left MCA cerebral vascular accident.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Urosepsis , candiduria.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 83-year-old man
with a history of diabetes , peripheral vascular disease ,
bilateral above the knee amputations , dementia who presented on
1/1/06 to the Dacoveneers Hospital Emergency Department with
mental status changes including increased confusion and decreased
responsiveness over the past two to three days. He had some
degree of baseline dementia but there was a definite change in
his mental changes according to his son. His son also reports
that the patient had decreased urine output over the past two
days with decreased p.o. intake as well. Although , the patient
did not complain of nausea , vomiting , fevers , diarrhea , chest
pain , or shortness of breath. He arrived in the emergency
department obtunded , responsive to pain only.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease , status post
bilateral above the knee amputations , diabetes mellitus , insulin
dependent , dementia , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , anemia or
chronic disease , traumatic brain injury in October 2002 , which
included a subdural hematoma and a subarachnoid hemorrhage , also
congestive heart failure with the ejection fraction of 28%
measured in September of 2002 , history of C. diff colitis and
polymyalgia rheumatica and hypertension.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Include Lantus , lisinopril , Ritalin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Denied tobacco and alcohol per the patient&apos;s
son. The patient lives with his son.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to be performed because the patient
was obtunded.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission , he had a
temperature of 96.5 , heart rate is 60 , blood pressure of 138/86 ,
respiratory rate of 14 , he is sating 97% on room air. He was
obtunded and responded to the pain by localizing with his left
hand. His skin was dry and cold to the touch. He had dry mucous
membranes. He had no jugular venous distention. His heart had
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. He
did have a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen was soft and nondistended ,
positive bowel sounds. Rectal exam was deferred. Bilateral
above the knee amputations with no signs of infection from the
past surgical site. He had 2+ radial pulses. His neuro exam , he
was obtunded. His pupils were equal and reactive to light. He
had no thorough reflex. On initial examination , he had increased
tone in his upper left extremity and he was moving his left upper
extremity but not his right.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , his Chem-7 was pertinent for a
glucose of 242 , a creatinine of 1.5 , and a BUN of 40. His white
count was 11.1 with a crit of 31.6 and platelets of 314 , 000. His
PT was 13.8 and INR of 1.1 and a PTT of 29.3. His EKG showed
sinus bradycardia with T-wave inversions in I , aVL , V3 through V6
with no ST changes. Compared to a prior EKG in July of 2004 ,
there were no acute changes. His initial set of cardiac enzymes
was negative. A Foley catheter was placed with frank pus
expressed into the Foley catheter bag. A UA was sent from that
specimen , which showed greater than 200 white blood cells , 3+
leuk esterase , negative nitrites , and 2+ bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID: The patient was admitted initially with the diagnosis of
mental status changes and urosepsis given the grossly positive
urine in the Foley and a positive UA. Urine culture was sent.
He was started on levofloxacin for a total course of five days.
He was fluid hydrated with normal saline bolus of 500 mL in a
rate of 100 mL per hour after that. He was also given a dose of
vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the emergency department , which
were discontinued on admission to the floor. The urine culture
eventually did not grow out any bacteria , but did grow out
greater than 100 , 000 candida. He was started on fluconazole IV
and that was discontinued after one day and he was switched
instead to an amphotericin bladder washout with 50 mg going into
a 1 L sterile water bag , which was infused into the bladder at 42
mL an hour continuously over the course of 24 hours. Further
into his hospital course , he again spiked the temperature on
5/23/06 to 101.6 degrees with transient hypertension with the
systolics into the 80s. At that point , he was started on
vancomycin , Flagyl , and gentamicin. Another urine culture , blood
culture and chest x-ray were done at that time. Blood cultures
eventually did not grow out anything as well as the urine , which
was also negative. His blood pressure improved with the fluid
bolus and over the next few days , he remained afebrile with a
stable blood pressure. On the night before discharge , the
patient&apos;s IV infiltrated and we were unable to replace the IV to
administer a one-time dose of gentamicin of 350 mg IV , which is
the extended interval dosing. At that time , we had conversation
with the patient&apos;s healthcare proxy who is Carlo Serpe who
agreed that no further attempts at IV should be made and we
should continue to not have a Foley catheter in place. On
discharge , the patient will be sent home without antibiotics and
without a Foley catheter and the family is aware and agrees with
this plan.
Neuro: After the initial course of antibiotics in the emergency
department , we expected the patient&apos;s mental status to be vastly
improved. On exam the next morning , he continued to be obtunded
and did not seem to be moving his right arm. We therefore got a
head CT , which showed a large new left MCA territorial infarct.
We started aspirin and we consulted neurology. Neurology at
first recommended that we do an MRI , MRA and a lumbar puncture to
further investigate the mental status changes , but these studies
were deferred given the lack of interventions available to us
given the patient&apos;s decreased functional status. We did however
obtained a transthoracic echocardiogram , which showed an ejection
fraction of 30% and no thrombus , which could have been the nadirs
for the stroke. We also got carotid ultrasounds , which did show
75% stenosis in the right ICA and 1% to 25% stenosis on the left ,
which would not explain the stroke on the left side. We also
checked a lipid panel and started a low dose of simvastatin to
prevent further stroke evaluation and formation. Neurology had
signed off and he has a neurology follow-up appointment with Dr.
Mcleroy as an outpatient if needed.
Cardiovascular: He has a presumed history of coronary artery
disease given his low ejection fraction and regional wall motion
abnormalities seen on the echocardiogram. We started a low dose
of atenolol with hold parameters as well as lisinopril and as
mentioned before , we continued aspirin.
Endocrine: We continued the patient&apos;s Lantus dose and titrated
it as necessary. On discharge , he is going home with Lantus 6
units daily with the NovoLog scale for additional coverage.
FEN: At first , we kept the patient n.p.o. given his obtunded
state. We got a speech and swallow consult , which evaluated his
swallowing mechanisms and agreed that he could tolerate p.o. and
okayed him for nectar-thick pureed diet. He did not take a lot
of p.o. during his hospital course and was only able to be fed by
members of his family with any real efficacy. The topic of
placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was broached
with the family , but given that the patient is taking some p.o. ,
they wanted to defer PEG tube placement given his low functional
capacity and high rate of mortality over the next year.
END OF LIFE: The patient came in with a code that is of DNR/DNI.
Given the patient&apos;s new large left MCA stroke , which has left him
functionally debilitated , several end of life care discussions
were held with the patient&apos;s healthcare proxy Randolph Ruddell and
as well as with the patient&apos;s son who seemed to be his primary
care giver. They have all come to the agreement that the patient
would not wants to have aggressive interventions done , which
include CPR , intubation , pressors , and at this point as well they
feel that interventions such as IV fluids or Foley catheters are
not in order as well. The patient is being discharged home where
the family has arranged a certain level of home healthcare with
their primary physician. The patient already has a home
healthcare aid who works 40 hours a week during the day and his
son takes care of him the rest of the time. They are working on
arrangements to further supplement his care with the home
healthcare aid , which will be able to cover the nights and
provide him 24 hours to provision as which he needs. Several
discussions were held about whether the patient should be placed
in a skilled nursing facility because of his extraordinary
healthcare needs and that he needs to be fed , he needs to have
his diaper changed , and his hygiene looked after , but given that
the patient&apos;s wishes were to go home , the family felt
that they would try to take him home and feed him themselves and
see how he does and if that did not workout well , they would opt
for a more structured living facility for the patient. The
patient&apos;s family is aware of the large amount of working effort
that this patient will require in the future and they have agreed
to take on this task. We have offered our social services to
help with establishing further home healthcare needs , but the
family has actually done this independently with the primary care
physician.
COMPLICATIONS: There were no complications for this hospital
stay.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient was
afebrile with the temperature of 98.1 , his heart rate is 68 ,
blood pressure was 130/60 , respirations were 20 , and he is sating
94% to 99% on room air. On exam , he was awake and looking
around. He was nonverbal. He was moving his left upper
extremity but not his right using it to scratch his face and
forehead. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1
and S2 , no murmurs appreciated. His lungs were clear to

ATTENDING: SARCONE , BERNARDO BRADLEY MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. Weakness.
2. Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Bacteremia.
2. Giant cell arteritis.
3. Congestive heart failure.
CONSULTS: Neurology on 9/23/05 .
PROCEDURE: Attempted lumbar puncture on 9/23/05
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 81-year-old male
with history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , atrial
fibrillation , giant cell arteritis , and congestive heart failure
with preserved systolic function , who presents with generalized
weakness. On the day of admission , the patient&apos;s children and
VNA were unable to get in touch with him and came to his house ,
where he was sitting too weak to answer the door. At that time ,
he was apparently confused and disoriented. The patient reports
feeling poorly for about two years since his diagnosis with giant
cell arteritis , but denied any acute change over the past several
days prior to admission. He denied focal weakness , slurred
speech , bowel or bladder incontinence , loss of consciousness and
had no witnessed seizure activity. He also denied chest pain , palpitations ,
shortness of breath , increased dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea ,
and also had no report of fever , cough , dysuria , urinary
frequency , diarrhea , abdominal pain , jaw claudication , calf
tenderness , or vision loss. He did think that he had recently
lost weight and has chronic lower extremity edema and chronic
right shoulder pain. In the ED , he was afebrile with pulse of
78 , blood pressure 124/60 , and breathing 16 times per minute.
His potassium was noted to be low. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary
edema and head CT was negative. He received potassium and
magnesium repletion as well as oxycodone for right shoulder pain
and was admitted for weakness in the setting of hypokalemia and
volume overload.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure with preserved
systolic function , chronic lower extremity edema , diabetes
mellitus type 2 , history of atrial fibrillation s/p DC cardioversion ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , giant cell arteritis , chronic renal
insufficiency , history of spinal stenosis , gout , depression , and
status post recent left thigh ulcer excision.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Zocor 20 mg
p.o. daily , atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. daily , Medrol 10 mg daily , glyburide 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and
multivitamin 1 tab p.o. daily.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone with a cat. His son
visits him daily. He denies tobacco use but reports alcohol use
of one drink a day.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals - afebrile , pulse 74 ,
blood pressure 105/51 , respirations 18 , and sats 92% on room air.
GEN - NAD , pleasant elderly gentleman. HEENT - MMM , oropharynx
was clear. Neck - JVP is 12 cm. PULM - poor inspiratory effort
on exam , left side mostly clear with decreased breath sounds and
rales at the right base. CV - regular rate with early beats and
no murmurs , gallops , or rubs appreciated. ABD - soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. EXT - 1+ pitting
edema to knees , faint distal pulses , left thigh sutures with mild
surrounding erythema. Neuro - cranial nerves II through XII
grossly intact , motor strength is 5/5 throughout except the right
deltoid , which is limited by pain and hip flexors , which were 4/5
bilaterally.
ADMISSION EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 78 , T wave
inversions in aVL , which were old.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ID - The patient developed hypotension on the morning of
9/23/05 . He was given IV fluids , stress dose steroids , and
started on broader antibiotic coverage ( vancomycin and
levofloxacin ). He was also started on acyclovir with concern for
encephalopathy in the setting of increased lethargy and
right-sided deficits reported earlier that morning. He responded
to IV fluids and did not require pressor support. A lumbar
puncture was attempted and was unsuccessful. His blood cultures
from 9/23/05 in the a.m. grew gram-negative rods and antibiotics
which were changed to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for double
gram-negative coverage. The other cultures grew one out of four
pansensitive pseudomonas and one out of four Bacteroides fragilis
and his antibiotics were changed to ceftazidime , levofloxacin ,
and Flagyl. The acyclovir was stopped. Blood cultures were
repeated on the evening of 9/23/05 and were negative. He was
discharged home with a PICC line to complete a 14-day course of
antibiotics. At the time of discharge , the patient was afebrile
and vital signs were stable. His white blood cell count was
elevated likely secondary to steroids. The source of his
bacteremia was unclear , but most likely a bowel origin given its
species and would consider microperforation as the possibility.
A follow-up colonoscopy may be considered as an outpatient.
Other sources include sinusitis and recent removal of a left leg
ulcer , but were unlikely to result in pseudomonas and
Bacteroides.
2. Neuro - The patient presented with generalized nonfocal
weakness. On the morning of 9/23/05 , he developed focal
right-sided weakness , aphasia , and lethargy/confusion. Stat head
CT/CTA and neuro consult were done and the patient was started on
acyclovir for concern of CNS infection. Lumbar puncture was
attempted but was unsuccessful. CTA was negative for acute stroke
and MRI/MRA was also done and was negative. The patient&apos;s
right-sided deficits were transient and the patient&apos;s mental
status also improved during the rest of his hospitalization. The
cause of his acute symptoms were unclear , but included giant cell
arteritis exacerbation , recrudescence of previous stroke ,
transient hypotension from sepsis and TIA. Interestingly , on
review of his chart , it was also found that the initial ED
nursing note per EMS reported right-sided weakness , which must
have been transient as well because the ED physician note was
without focality.
3. CV/Pulm - ( I ) The patient denied chest pain and troponin was
negative x 2. He was continued on aspirin and statin and
restarted on beta-blocker when his blood pressures improved.
( P ) - The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart
failure and was admitted with mild pulmonary edema on chest
x-ray. He was initially given Lasix , but was discontinued on the
morning 9/23/05 in the setting of hypertension. He also
complained of shortness of breath at that time , but chest x-ray
was repeated , which showed clear lungs. His sats were 94 to 95%
on two to three liters of oxygen. He required aggressive fluid
resuscitation for his hypotension , which he tolerated well. He
again became short of breath on the morning of 2/27/05 and was
thought to be mildly volume overloaded. He was given IV Lasix and
restarted on daily p.o. Lasix. He was discharged on 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Lasix.
( R ) - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and status
post DC cardioversion. He presented in sinus rhythm. He did
require IV Lopressor and verapamil for rapid rate atrial flutter
on 5/25/05 to 2/27/05 , which was somewhat refractory to
treatment. However , his rate quickly improved on placement of a
Foley in the setting of difficulty voiding and a large bladder
residual. At the time of discharge , he was restarted on his home
dose of atenolol.
4. Renal - The patient presented with chronic renal
insufficiency , which remained stable during his hospitalization.
His creatinine ranged from 1.5 to 1.9. The patient&apos;s Foley
catheter was removed on 5/25/05 and the patient began to
complain of urinary frequency and urgency on 2/27/05 .
Urinalysis and urine culture were negative. However , postvoid
residual was one liter and his Foley was replaced. On discharge ,
he was given a trial to void , which was not completed. It was
recommended that the patient be discharged with a Foley , but was
declined. The patient and his family were informed of our recommendation. He
has VNA services scheduled who are aware
of his urinary difficulty and should check postvoid residual and replace the
Foley or teach straight cath as needed.
5. Heme - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and
was previously on Coumadin anticoagulation. However , his
Coumadin was stopped several days prior to admission for left leg
ulcer excision and presented subtherapeutic with an INR of 1.2.
His Coumadin was held during his stay in the MICU , but was
restarted prior to discharge. He will be followed by CMH
Anticoagulation and should be closely monitored in the setting of
antibiotics. On discharge , his INR was 1.6.
6. Derm - The patient had a left leg ulcer excision several days
prior to admission. The patient should have sutures removed
after discharge at two weeks post excision. The site was an
unlikely source of his bacteremia.
7. Rheum/Endocrine- The patient has a history of giant cell
arteritis. ESR was elevated to 99 on admission. The patient was
initially continued on home dose Medrol. However , on the morning
of 9/23/05 , in the setting of right-sided weakness , mental
status change , and hypotension , the patient was changed to
high-dose Solu-Medrol with concern for his GCA
exacerbation/vasculitis. When the cultures grew preliminary
gram-negative rods and MRI of the brain was negative for
vasculitis , he was changed to stress dose hydrocortisone.
Steroids were tapered during hospitalization and the patient was
discharged on a continued taper back over one week to his home dose Medrol 10
mg per day. The patient was also on glyburide as an outpatient
for diabetes mellitus. As an inpatient , he was given insulin for
more aggressive control. On discharge , the patient was to
continue on twice per day insulin 70/30 while recovering and
tapering steroids. As an outpatient , it may be considered to
resume his oral agents in place of insulin.
8. Access- The patient had a right internal jugular central
venous line placed in the MICU , which was discontinued prior to
discharge. A PICC line was placed for home antibiotics.
9. FEN- The patient presented with hypokalemia to 2.9 and required
multiple doses of repletion. At the time of discharge , his
potassium was 3.1 and received additional potassium on that day.
He was discharged on a regimen of 40 mEq of potassium chloride
per day. He will need his potassium to be rechecked as an
outpatient in the setting of receiving daily Lasix. However ,
there was concern for more aggressive outpatient repletion in the
setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
10. Prophylaxis- The patient was given Nexium and Lovenox.
RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:
1. CT head on 2/7/05 - no acute intracranial abnormality ,
bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
2. Portable chest x-ray on 2/7/05 - mild pulmonary edema.
3. PA and lateral chest x-ray on 2/7/05 - stable with mild
cardiomegaly , no acute pulmonary process.
4. CTA head , 9/23/05 - paraventricular white matter changes
consistent with small vessel ischemia; mild-to-moderate atrophy
with compensatory ventricular megaly , mild- to-moderate proximal
right internal carotid artery stenosis with calcification and

internal carotid arteries as well as the bifurcation of the
proximal left internal carotid artery with no appreciable
stenosis and calcification and mild narrowing of the origin of
the right vertebral artery; complete opacification of bilateral
maxillary sinus , mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid and
sphenoid sinuses; degenerative changes at the cervical spine.

evidence of acute infarction , no intracranial collections of mass
lesions; mild involutional changes present.
8. Portable chest x-ray , 7/5/05 , bibasilar opacities due at
least in part to atelectasis; right jugular central venous
catheter was stable in position; no evidence for substantial

dose halved on antibiotics ( ACH Anticoagulation may adjust this
based on lab values ); steroid taper over the week following
discharge to his original dose; last dose of antibiotics on
3/23/05 , the PICC line can be removed when his course of
ceftazidime is complete.
2. The patient is on insulin two times per day while recovering.
Possibility to return to glyburide should be discussed with his
PCP once steroid taper and antibiotics completed.
3. It was recommended that the patient be discharged with the
Foley catheter given his difficulty voiding , however , he
declined. His ability to void should be assessed by the VNA
Services and the patient should be straight cathed as necessary.
4. The patient should record daily weights and keep a
glucose log , which should be presented at his PCP follow-up.
5. The patient should follow up with his PCP within one week and
have lytes checked at that time.
6. The VNA Services should check a Chem-7 on Sunday following
discharge. INR is to be followed by ITMC Anticoagulation Clinic
at 391-697-7896.

ATTENDING: HONSINGER , ANDREA MD
SERVICE: Cardiology.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary edema , hypertensive urgency ,
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction , status post
catheterization.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension since at least 1995.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea , on CPAP.
5. Status post cerebrovascular accident.
6. Pneumonia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient , Mr. Genuario is a
44-year-old married Hispanic male with a history of diabetes;
hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; and obstructive sleep apnea ,
on CPAP , who presented to the Ryans Valley Hospital Emergency Room on November ,
2005 , with complaint of shortness of breath. His wife reported
that he has been experiencing gradually worsening shortness of
breath since the afternoon of October , 2005 , without any chest
pain. He has increased dyspnea on exertion , needing to use a
CPAP at night. He was found to be hypertensive to the 200/100 ,
with florid pulmonary edema and hypertensive encephalopathy. The
patient was then intubated for airway protection and oxygenation
and admitted to the R.f. Hospital ICU where he was diuresed
aggressively. The patient&apos;s hypertension was difficult to
control , requiring labetalol initially and then a successful
regimen of IV nitroglycerin , nitroprusside , hydralazine , and
Lopressor. The patient received a TEE on November , 2005 , which
showed concentric LVH , no wall motion abnormalities , and EF of
45%. There was a concern for aortic dissection on
echocardiogram , but an MRI/MRA revealed no dissection. The
patient was also frequently agitated requiring increasing doses
of Versed and fentanyl as well as p.r.n. Haldol and Zyprexa.
During the admission to Nymo Hospital , he had lateral ST segment
depressions on multiple EKGs and a non-ST-elevation MI ( NSTEMI )
with a peak troponin of 20 on November , 2005 , a peak CK of 430 ,
and a peak MB of 20. He was started on ASA , heparin ,
beta-blocker , statin , and Integrilin and transferred to the IH
on March , 2005 , for management for possible catheterization.
At the Mancharl Tuvange Memorial Hospital ICU , the patient also had marked hyperglycemia
and was put on a ??___?? protocol.
At the Ston N CCU , he was found to have a cardiac enzyme leak
with a peak CK of 286 , CK-MB of 6.2 , and troponin of 13.8 , which
trended down. His EKG showed signs of evolving anterior MI. The
patient was continued to be maintained on aspirin , Plavix , and
Lipitor while Integrilin was discontinued on CCU day #2 as the
patient was not stable for cardiac catheterization. His blood
pressure continued to be very difficult to control. The patient
came in from the PAMC with a nitroglycerin drip , which was weaned
and transitioned to Norvasc 5 mg q.d. , captopril 25 t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 100 q.i.d. , and hydralazine 50 q.i.d. However , his
blood pressure continued to rise ??___?? on CCU day #4 and
Nipride drip was initiated. This increase was in the setting of
confusion ??___??. His Nipride was weaned on day #5 and his p.o.
blood pressure medications were restarted with systolic blood
pressure goal of 140. The patient also had an episode of sinus
pause of greater than 2.5 seconds on September , 2005 , with no
symptoms. IV labetalol was discontinued after that episode.
CCU course was complicated by the patient spiking a fever to
104.1 on CCU day #3 , and he was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics for presumptive ICU pneumonia. He was started on
vancomycin , ceftazidime , and levofloxacin was added. The CCU
course was also complicated by the patient developing left-sided
weakness in the left lower extremity on ICU day #5 , which was
concerning for CVA. An MRI/MRA was obtained which showed small
vessel disease consistent with hypertension-induced
cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of embolism. An
echocardiogram was obtained and was negative for any cardiac
sources and emboli and with a negative bubble study. Secondary
to the patient&apos;s mental status and question of inability to
swallow , an NG tube was placed; however , it was self-discontinued
by the patient on September , 2005. The patient was transferred to
the cardiology team on January , 2005 , for further medical
management prior to cardiac catheterization for the
non-ST-elevation MI.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 44-year-old male with history of
hypertension , diabetes , high cholesterol , and obstructive sleep
apnea presenting with hypertensive crisis , pulmonary edema ,
status post ICU stay complicated by multiple strokes and
left-sided weakness , non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
likely demand ischemia secondary to hypertension and agitation ,
hyperglycemia requiring ??___?? protocol , and question of
ICU-acquired pneumonia with spiking fever needing the use of
broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient is now transferred to
the floor for further management prior to catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. CV: Ischemia: EKG showing sign of an evolving anterior MI.
The patient continued to be on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor. The
patient received a catheterization on August , 2005 , which shows
left oblique marginal #1 with 90% discrete lesion that was
stented to 0 with a DES stent and RCA with 80% discrete lesion
stented to 0. The patient was stable postcatheterization.
Pump: The patient&apos;s blood pressure continued to be high on the
floor. He was started on captopril 50 t.i.d. , eventually
increased to 100 t.i.d.; hydralazine 20 q.i.d. IV , eventually
switching over to 50 p.o. q.i.d. The patient was restarted on
home medication of clonidine patch as discontinuation can cause
labile hypertension. He was also started on Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. During the catheterization , the patient was found to have
a pulmonary wedge pressure of 17 , which is elevated. He was
given IV Lasix to diurese. He diuresed very well with the p.o.
and IV dose.
Rhythm: The patient had two episodes of sinus pause greater than
3 seconds on September , 2005 , with no episodes since September ,
2005. It could be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea versus
conduction abnormality. Electrophysiology service was consulted.
The EP service encouraged the patient to wear a CPAP device
during the day. His beta-blocker was held secondary to the sinus
pause. However , after the catheterization and with the result of
obstructive lesion , the patient was restarted on low-dose
beta-blocker with atenolol 25 mg q.d.
2. Pulmonary: When transferred , the patient&apos;s sedation was
weaned and he was without any pressure on CCU day #4. He had
received Lasix for pulmonary edema. He continued to diuresed on
the floor with 80 mg p.o. of Lasix.
3. ID: The patient had spiked a fever to 104.1 on March ,
2005 , with a question of pneumonia. He was continued on his
vancomycin , ceftazidime , and levofloxacin for a 14-day course.
His vancomycin will be completed on discharge while he will need
to continue on ceftazidime and levofloxacin during
rehabilitation. The patient was MRSA negative. He continues to
have low-grade fever , but no frank fever over 100.4. The patient
continued to improve and does not complain of any subjective
fever.
4. GI: The patient received an NG tube on September , 2005 , but it
was self-discontinued. He had speech and swallow test , which he
passed and was started on the house diet. The patient received a
nutrition consult for his diabetes and was put on a cardiac and
diabetic diet. His magnesium and potassium were repleted.
5. Renal: On admission , his creatinine was 1.6 and trended down
to 1.2 and 1.1 prior to discharge. We thought that his
increasing creatinine is likely secondary from hypertensive
injury. The patient was given Mucomyst prior and after
catheterization. He tolerated the ACE inhibition with no rise in
creatinine.
6. Neurologic: On CCU day #5 , the patient developed weakness in
the left upper and lower extremity with concern for CVA.
Neurologic consult was initiated and MRI and MRA were obtained.
MRI/MRA showed small vessel disease consistent with
hypertension-induced CVA. He had a negative echocardiogram and
negative bubble study. The patient was given some physical
therapy and will likely need rehabilitation.
7. Endocrine: The patient takes Humalog 75/25 50 units before
breakfast and 20 units before dinner , NPH 20 at bedtime , and also
Actos and metformin. Here , the patient was given a NovoLog
sliding scale with 14 units of NovoLog q.a.c. and Lantus 35
q.h.s. He will be continued on these doses and will need to be
transitioned to his home medications once he goes home.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive PPI and heparin for
prophylaxis.
CODE: Full.
DISPOSITION: The patient will likely need rehabilitation for his
prolonged ICU course and also for his stroke.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The discharge medications will be
dictated as an addendum pending discharge.

Discharge Date: 1/29/2005
ATTENDING: WERNER RENEE MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Change in mental status.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Hypercarbic respiratory failure and
aspiration pneumonia.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENTATION: The patient is a 74-year-old
woman with a past medical history significant for rectosigmoid
cancer complicated with vesicular vaginal fistula status post
total pelvic exenteration , cystectomy with ileal loop diversion
on February 2004 , obesity , hypoventilation syndrome with chronic
respiratory acidosis status post gluteal sacral abscess who was
brought to the Emergency Department from a skilled nursing
facility with change in mental status and sacral wound infection.
In the Emergency Department at 4 p.m. her vitals were noted to
be a temperature 98 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 145/63 , and
she was breathing 90% on 4 liters nasal cannula. She was noted
to have no orientation to place and ABG showed a pH of 7.2 , PCO2
103 and a PO2 of 249. At 5:30 p.m. the patient became
diaphoretic. Blood cultures were drawn and her mental status was
worsening. She was started on 100% nonrebreather and subsequent
ABG was 7.17 , PCO2 of 109 , PO2 of 217. With Bipap initiation her
ABG improved to a pH of 7.21 , PCO2 of 87 , PO2 of 87. Then , she
was subsequently intubated , started on assist control ventilation
with an ABG of 7.37 , PCO2 of 59 , PO2 141. She was a difficult
intubation , required fiberoptic assistance. Her vitals at that
time , she had a blood pressure of 80-90/60s , that slowly returned
to 110s/60s. In the Emergency Department , a head CT , PE protocol
CT and chest abdominal CT showed right lower lobe opacification.
She had a head CT that showed no acute intracranial abnormality.
An abdominal CT showed an air fluid collection in the pelvis and
some cholelithiasis and a CT PE showed no evidence of PE though
admittedly the study was limited and there was a small bilateral
pleural effusion and right lower lobe consolidative paucity
possibly representing an early pneumonia. She was started on
Levo Flagyl and Vanc and received 1-2 liters IV fluid. In
addition , she had elevated K which was treated with insulin D5
calcium gluconate. She had an EKG which showed T wave inversions
of V2-V4 and flat T waves in V5. She was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where she was intubated and sedated with
Versed and Fentanyl , and at that time she was hemodynamically
stable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history is
notable locally advanced rectosigmoid cancer T4 M1 metastatic
diagnosed in 2003. It was diagnosed in the context of diarrhea
and rectal bleeding and passing stool in the vagina and bladder.
She had vesicular and vaginal fistulas at that time. She is
status post total pelvic exenteration with ileal loop diversion
in February 2004 , status post XRT in July and September 2004 , status
post gluteal sacral abscess August 2004 , status post c-dif
colitis in August 2004 , status post e. coli MSS bacteremia in
August 2004 , obesity , hypoventilation syndrome. She normally
sats in the 80s on room air. She has iron deficiency anemia ,
GERD , osteoarthritis. An echo April 2004 showed normal left
ventricular function with an EF of 60% with question of elevated
right-sided pressures , LVH and she suffered immobility secondary
to XRT with back pain and lower extremity edema , status post
total abdominal hysterectomy in August 2001 , and had a
pulmonary evaluation in February 2004 in which she was assessed to
have obesity , hypoventilation syndrome , nocturnal oxygen
desaturation , chronic respiratory acidosis complicated with
longstanding obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
MEDICATIONS: The patient takes Tylenol p.r.n. pain , vitamin C
500 b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 daily , iron sulfate 325 t.i.d. ,
oxycodone 5 q.4h p.r.n. pain though she does not require that
very often , Toprol XL 50 daily , Lovenox 40 subq. daily , Remeron
7.5 q.h.s. , Xalantan 7 drops OU , Seroquel 25 q.h.s. , Nexium 20
daily , Mag oxide 800 b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Erythromycin causes GI upset , penicillin causes mouth
sores.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has two children , she is divorced , lives at
a skilled nursing facility , prior smoker but does not drink
alcohol and no history of IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Complicated with obesity. Father died at age of
83 of colon cancer. Mother had dementia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a morbidly obese woman who
at the time of the document exam was intubated , vented and
sedated. She was asleep , did not open her eyes. Her neck was
supple. Chest: There were coarse breath sounds with diffuse
wheezes. Her cardiac exam was notable for an S1 , S2 , regular
rate and rhythm and the JVP was difficult to assess. Abdominal
exam was notable for a colostomy. Her abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and no bowel sounds were appreciated. Her extremities
were warm and well perfused. Neurologically , she was sedated.
Skin was not notable for any rashes or petechiae.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system:
1. Pulmonary: The patient was in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit from the 29 of March to the 25 of May of October . She has known obesity
hypoventilation syndrome. She was weaned from assist control to
pressure support ventilation. On the 25 of May , the patient self
extubated , was put on bipap and then quickly transitioned to
nasal cannula. The patient did report needing bipap at night at
one point though later on it was felt that she was not on bipap
at night normally. She has an elevated right hemidiaphragm seen
on chest x-ray and at baseline sats 90-93% on 2 liters. On the
floor , she was seen by pulmonary consult about management of her
obesity ventilation syndrome. At the time of discharge the
patient is to sleep on bipap 10/0. Those parameters will need to
be optimized with a sleep study after discharge and , in addition ,
the patient will have to be observed at night with sats being
monitored to qualify her for bipap at night. In the hospital we
did monitor her sats overnight and she satted 85-87% on 2 liters
of nasal cannula when she was sleeping at night.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient had a right lower lobe
pneumonia treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl that was started
in the Emergency Department on November , 2005. She will
complete a 14 day course of those antibiotics. The patient was
consistently afebrile and the thought was the patient had
aspiration right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient did receive a
few doses of Vancomycin which was later discontinued. The
patient was also treated by Diflucan and Flagyl to cover BV/yeast
infection as the patient was noted to have some vaginal
discharge. The vaginal discharge ultimately had negative
cultures. The patient also had a known stage IV decubitus in her
sacral area that did not appear to be infected.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient was volume overloaded after
receiving significant fluids when she first presented. She had a
left pleural effusion on subsequent chest x-rays. She was
diuresed aggressively with Lasix. Typical doses were 40 mg IV
and at the time of discharge the patient could comfortably lie
flat on her back without any discomfort. The patient also was
noted to have some ectopy. Her lytes were repleted. An
echocardiogram was checked which showed normal EF moderate right
ventricular dysfunction and no wall motion abnormalities. This
did not demonstrate any change from prior.
4. Neuropsych: The patient had an altered mental status likely
related to hypercarbic respiratory failure and also hypoxemia at
the time of present admission. She was weaned off sedation. She
had a negative head CT. When she was extubated , the patient was
alert and oriented and returned back to baseline mental status.
5. Heme: The patient was immobile at baseline and is high risk
for PET protocol. CT at the time of admission was negative and
the patient was treated with Lovenox prophylaxis. The patient
was also continued on her iron pills.
6. Renal: The patient has metabolic compensation for
respiratory acidosis which resolved during the ICU stay , and the
patient&apos;s creatinine return to baseline during her
hospitalization.
7. GI: The patient received tube feeds through her OG tube and
was transitioned to p.o.&apos;s.
8. Surgery/GYN: The patient has a known colonic vaginal fistula
with purulent vaginal discharge. She was seen by surgery and GYN
who evaluated her and looked at her abdominal CT and felt that
this was not a clinically significant fistula and was not in fact
a source of infection.
9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to a skilled
nursing facility/rehab facility. She requires intensive
rehabilitation and nursing given her body habitus and her limited
mobility.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will be discharged on vitamin
C 500 b.i.d. , calcium carbonate 500 t.i.d. , Colace 100 b.i.d. ,
Pepcid 20 b.i.d. , iron sulfate 325 t.i.d. , mag oxide 840 b.i.d. ,
mag sliding scale , Flagyl 500 p.o. t.i.d. to finish on November , zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o. daily , Lovenox 40 mg subq. daily ,
Xalantan 1 drop OU q.p.m. , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily to
finish on August , miconazole nitrate 2% topical powder
b.i.d. , Combivent neb 2 puffs q.i.d. as needed , Promod 2 scoops
p.o. daily , Maalax q.6h p.r.n. upset stomach.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: HARRISON BOTRAS MD
DISCHARGE DATE: 2/18/04 , anticipated.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Aortic stenosis , COPD , cough , diabetes ,
history of DVT , hypertension , GERD.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old man with a
history of coronary artery disease , COPD , end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis , and ischemic cardiomyopathy presenting as a
transfer from Nivi Niot Rehabilitation Center for management of ischemic
cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. Briefly , he was admitted to
Tawde Memorial Hospital on 7/16/04 , with varied symptoms including
a nonproductive cough , bronchospasm , and shortness of breath. He
also was hypoglycemic with a glucose of 34 , likely due to
anorexia and continued used of regular amounts of insulin. He
was found to have positive cardiac enzymes as well with a
troponin peaking at approximately 4.3 , and was seen by
Cardiology , Renal Services in consultation. Concurrently , he was
treated with a course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for
presumed bronchitis. The initial plan recommended by Cardiology
included an echocardiogram , which was read at that time ,
indicated decreased ejection fraction of only about 15% to 20%.
This represented a change from prior. The next step intended was
for a cardiac catheterization , but there was concern regarding
his aortic stenosis which despite a gradient of only 14% on
echocardiogram , was concerning , as this might represent an
underestimation. He was transferred to Mid-li Ners Lini Medical Center for further evaluation of both the need for aortic valve
replacement and this new reduced ejection fraction , felt to
likely be ischemic cardiomyopathy , with a demand related
non-ST-elevation MI.
Of note , he also had a pulmonary artery pressure of 68 on his
prior echo. He has had a cardiac cath in 2000 showing
well-preserved ventricular function , overall EF 60% , with LAD 30%
to 40% , 60% diagonal , 100% RCA , 60% OMB , and diffuse circumflex
disease.
Shortly before transfer , he was hemodialyzed as regularly
scheduled. He had been placed on a prednisone taper for
questionable COPD exacerbation.
At this time , he denies any chest pain or chest heaviness now or
prior to admission. He has no back or jaw pain. He does have
shortness of breath with a nonproductive cough and wheezes. No
fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting. No orthopnea. Increased lower
extremity edema and increased salty food intake immediately prior
to Ronbranch Ded Memorial Hospital hospitalization. He was feeling well one week
prior to admission at Disekend .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent ,
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis x 2 years ( Monday ,

ALLERGIES: Demerol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: A retired boiler worker , lives in MS with
his wife. No living children. Not currently smoker. Rare
alcohol use.
FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Son died at age 44 of renal cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for O2 sat of 96% on 4 liters ,
coughing but no distress , blood pressure 106/56. JVP , 6 cm.
Diminished second sound , 3/6 mid peaking systolic ejection
murmur , high pitched , audible at apex , left lower sternal border ,
and aortic ausculatory area. Abdomen: Moderately obese , soft ,
nontender , no bruits. Femoral pulses: Weak , no distal pulses , no
edema. Extremities: Warm.
EKG: Sinus is 74 , LVH , left atrial enlargement , old inferior MI
with Q waves in III and aVF.
LABS: Notable for a creatinine of 7.4 , INR of 1.7 , hematocrit of
34.8 , white count of 11.9. Chest x-ray , clear.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 78-year-old man with coronary artery
disease , diabetes , end-stage renal disease , COPD , aortic
stenosis , here with shortness of breath , and increased troponins.
The most concerning feature was interval decrease in ejection
fraction from 60% to 10% to 15% over a four-year interval.
Slightly ischemic concerning with old inferior MI and with
elevated troponins.
COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: He was maintained on aspirin , statin , and
ACE ( renally dosed ). Beta-blocker held secondary to
bronchospasm. His echo was reevaluated and felt to be close at
30% ejection fraction. He had a diagnostic cardiac
catheterization to assess his aortic stenosis on 9/10/04 . The
findings were an aortic valve area of 1.2 to 1.6 cm2 with aortic
gradient of 21.1. His pulmonary artery pressure was peak of 61 ,
mean of 35. His vessels showed an LAD ostial 70% lesion , and LAD
proximal to mid 70% tubular lesion , a large marginal 80% lesion
left circumflex , a 100% occluded right coronary artery , with left
to right collaterals. It was also found to have a difficult
placing a right IJ catheter , likely occluded.
2. Cardiac surgery was consulted and these findings were
discussed. It was felt that he was a better candidate for
percutaneous stenting rather than immediate surgery given the
balance between his only mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis and the
high risks of surgery. Accordingly , he was observed over the
weekend and had a repeat catheterization on 2/12/04 with
stenting of the left circumflex marginal lesion from 99% to 0%
with a drug-eluting stent. He tolerated this procedure well
without hematoma and with maintenance of dopplerable pedal
pulses.
3. Pulmonary: He continued to have good oxygen saturations on 4
liters. After several days , he was tapered to 0 mg of
prednisone; he continued to have severe cough that gradually
improved , nonproductive throughout. He was on antitussive
medications as needed. He completed a course of azithromycin
that had been started at Teety Flandter Bassba Of Medical Center .  Chest x-rays were
clear x 2. He attempted PFTs , but his vital capacity was
severely limited by cough. However , his FEV1 was 0.89 , 40% of
predicted.
4. Hematologic: His Coumadin was held given the unclear need
for acute anticoagulation ( remote DVT , already protected by IVC
filter ) and the concern that he might need an intervention. This
was started shortly before discharge with the expectation he
would follow up as prior to admission with his INRs.
5. Renal: He was seen by the Renal Team and dialyzed to his dry
weight on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday schedule.
6. Endocrine: His blood sugars were somewhat labile ranging
from the 300s to the 40s. This was complicated by the use of
prednisone. Post prednisone , he was placed on home regimen of 14
units q.a.m. , 8 units q.p.m. of NPH , and 8 units regular q.a.m.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 6/11/05 following cardiac
catheterization showing three-vessel coronary artery disease with
occluded RCA , focal severe proximal LAD stenosis , significant
disease of OM1 and OM2. He was assessed preoperatively for
coronary artery bypass surgery. He was taken to the operating
room on 10/2/05 where he underwent CABG x4 with the sequential
graft with saphenous vein graft , one connecting the aorta to OM1
then OM2 , LIMA to LAD , saphenous graft 2 to PDA. The patient was
then bypassed for 108 minutes. He left the operating room with
one ventricular wire , two pericardial tubes ( Blake drains ) , and
one left pleural tube ( Blake drain ). For further details , please
see the dictated operative note. The patient was taken to the
cardiac surgery ICU on Claseat following surgery.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3 throughout his ICU
stay. Following extubation , the patient had marginal respiratory
status , so pain control was accomplished with IV Dilaudid. The
patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency , so Toradol
was avoided. When the patient was taking p.o.&apos;s , Dilaudid was
changed to p.o. Dilaudid. Pain control was good with oral
Dilaudid throughout his ICU stay.
Cardiovascular: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on
postoperative day #1 through #3. However , the patient flipped
into atrial fibrillation in the 110s to 120s at 0100 on
postoperative day #3. He was started initially on his home dose
of 200 mg p.o. daily of amiodarone. However , later on
postoperative day #3 , this was changed to an amiodarone drip.
The patient was continued on amiodarone drip at 1 for six hours
and later decreased to 0.5 of amiodarone drip. Amiodarone drip
continued from postoperative day #4 to #5. The patient remained
in atrial fibrillation , so on postoperative day #3 at 1:00 a.m.
to postoperative day #6 , when he converted to sinus rhythm at
0500. The patient was transitioned to 200 mg p.o. daily of
amiodarone , which she was continued on at home after receiving
one full day of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. amiodarone. He was
transferred out of the unit on 200 mg p.o. daily of amiodarone.
The patient was started on 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. of Lopressor. Since
postoperative day #6 , the patient has remained in rate controlled
sinus rhythm without any episodes of atrial fibrillation. The
patient is also on aspirin and Zocor.
Respiratory: The patient is status post right lower lobectomy in
1996 for lung cancer and has a 100-year smoking history. His
respiratory status was marginal following extubation at 0400 on
postoperative day #1. The patient remained on 100% high flow
oxygen from postoperative day #2 to #4. The patient required
q.2h. nasotracheal suctioning and q.1h. chest PT in order to keep
him from being re-intubated. From postoperative day #2 to #4 , on
chest x-ray , the patient&apos;s right middle lobe appeared to be
collapsed. There was a question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.
The patient was started on levofloxacin on 9/30/05 on
postoperative day #2 , for questionable right middle lobe
pneumonia , as lobe is collapsed and the patient had extremely
thick secretions. The patient was continued on aggressive chest
PT and pulmonary toilet. He had a strong cough and was able to
cough up thick secretions on his own. The patient was unable on
postoperative day #2 to #3 to remove mask without desats into the
70s to 80s. He was started on his nebulizers around the clock on
Atrovent and mucomyst nebs , as well as his home inhalers of
fluticasone and albuterol. The patient appeared to be tiring
early in the morning on postoperative day #3 and Anesthesia was
called for an evaluation but the patient continued to struggle
along on 100% oxygen for two more days between BiPAP and 100%
high flow oxygen. With BiPAP , patient&apos;s pO2 on his gas was
improved. ABGs continued improved as the patient was able to
mobilize more. The patient is diuresed with the Lasix drip with
improvement in his respiratory status as well. The goal is to
keep patient 1 liter negative in order to improve his pulmonary
status. The patient had an episode on postoperative day #3 of
20-second loss of consciousness while getting nasotracheal
suction around 2300 on 8/28/05 . This was initially thought to
be hypoxic in origin. However , the patient had two further
episodes with strong cough on postoperative day #5 and #6 of 20
to 30-second losses of consciousness with no signs of a vagal
origin on cardiac monitor.
By postoperative day #5 to #6 , the patient&apos;s respiratory status
had improved. Diuresis was continued. The patient was given a
dedicated triple-lumen catheter with a dedicated TPN line on
8/20/05 , postoperative day #4 , as it was unclear whether the
patient would turn the corner and avoid intubation , and the
patient was also without nutrition for several days at this
point. The patient continued to improve in terms of his
respiratory status with diuresis. By postoperative day #6 , the
patient&apos;s right middle lobe appeared to be re-expanding on chest
x-ray. It continued to be re-expanded from postoperative day #6
to #10 on transfer from the unit on 11/4/05 . The patient is
continued on t.i.d. Lasix after his drip was turned off on
10/22/05 . Goal was to keep the patient negative in order to
maximize his pulmonary status. The patient has marginal
pulmonary reserve. The patient also continues on levofloxacin
for a total of an 11-day course for prophylaxis against
pneumonia.
GI: The patient is on a minced diet on transfer from the unit.
The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow. On
postoperative day #5 , 6/17/05 , a bedside evaluation was
performed and a video swallow was done. The patient at this time
was cleared for puree and thin liquids with a chin tuck. This
was changed to a minced diet on postoperative day #8 , as the
patient was thought to find this more palatable. The patient was
started on Nexium following extubation. TPN was started through
a dedicated port after a line change on postoperative day #4.
This was done , so the patient could continue getting nutrition
despite his marginal respiratory status. TPN was still continued
on discharge from the unit on 11/4/05 , as the patient had been
having calorie counts performed by nursing in order to make sure
that the patient was taking in adequate nutrition prior to
discontinuation of TPN. The patient continues to be in
aspiration risk , as he has very poor pulmonary status at
baseline. Continue calorie counts on discharge from the unit and
Nutrition will recommend stopping TPN when the patient is taking
enough in calories orally.
Renal: The patient&apos;s baseline creatinine was 1.3. His
creatinine has been stable around the 1.6 to 1.8 , postop
following diuresis with Lasix. The patient was started on a
Lasix drip on postoperative day #1 in order to gently diurese
him. He was continued on a Lasix drip until postoperative day #9
with adjustments to keep him negative and per chest x-ray every
morning. The patient was transitioned to 20 mg IV t.i.d. Lasix
on 10/22/05 , on postoperative day #9. This was increased on
postoperative day #10 , 11/4/05 , to 40 mg IV t.i.d. prior to
transfer from the unit , as the patient looked wet on chest x-ray.
The patient&apos;s right middle lobe appeared re-expanded on
postoperative day #6 to #10. This is critical for patient&apos;s
pulmonary reserve. Goal will be to keep the patient negative in
terms of his fluid balance in order to maximize his pulmonary
status. His creatinine has continued to remain stable. The
patient is urinating well and responds well to Lasix.
Endocrine: The patient was initially placed on a Portland
protocol and transitioned after postoperative day #3 to NovoLog
sliding scales with meals. At the time of transfer from the ICU ,
he continues on glipizide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. and then NovoLog
sliding scale with meals and nightly. He is also on NovoLog 8
units subcu with meals. This will be continued on transfer.
Sugar control has been good with these agents. The patient
remains on Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o. daily for his hypothyroidism.
Heme: The patient was started on aspirin on postoperative day #0
through his orogastric tube. This was continued on postoperative
with ECASA 325 mg p.o. daily , the patient&apos;s hematocrit and
platelets have been postop requiring no transfusions.
ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin on 9/30/05 ,
postoperative day #2 , for question of pneumonia with right middle
lobe collapse versus pneumonia on chest x-ray. This was
continued for a total of 11 days. The patient self medicates
with levofloxacin at home for bronchiectasis and chronic
bronchitis when his secretions become thick and troublesome.

fraction of 45% , and recurrent UTI , who was recently admitted for
hypoglycemia secondary to insulin overdose , comes in with 24
hours left lower quadrant pain , flank discomfort , low-grade
temperatures , dysuria , pain radiating down both legs to below the
knee. She was just DC&apos;d 6/21/06 , during admission grew Proteus
resistant to Cipro. She denies diarrhea , vomiting , nausea , point

Extremities: No edema , 1+ pulse bilaterally.
Neuro: 2+ DTR , decreased sensation to light touch in feet ,
unable to lift legs against gravity.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent positive , potassium 5.4 , BUN 69 ,
creatinine 2.3 , glucose 214 , hematocrit 32.3 at baseline.
Urinalysis , 50-60 white blood cells , 1+ bacteria , and cloudy
urine. On specification in prior hospital admission , Proteus
mirabilis sensitive to cephalosporins and resistance to
ciprofloxacin.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: The patient was admitted on
9/18/06. She had 10/10 bilateral leg pain which required change
of pain medication from oxycodone to Dilaudid , first p.r.n. doses
every 4 hours were allowed with 1-2 mg then this was augmented to
p.r.n. every 2 hours of 2-4 mg. Per pain consult , we changed
Neurontin to Lyrica 100 t.i.d. Over the next two days , patient&apos;s
pain symptoms improved tremendously on this regimen. She
decreased using the p.r.n. pain medications until she reached a
plateau of two usages of 2 mg Dilaudid p.o. a day next to her
methadone 5 mg three times a day.
UTI: During prehospital course , she ________ Bactrim and
ciprofloxacin , we put her on ceftriaxone 2 g once daily
intravenously for which her symptoms improved rapidly over the
next two or three days. She denies currently any abdominal pain ,
flank pain , dysuria , and urinary tract infection has clinically
resolved. Please continue intravenous medication for at least
another seven days until 3/11/06.
FUTURE CARE PLAN:
Neuropathic pain: The patient has diabetic neuropathy. The
patient is on Lyrica 100 mg three times a day , methadone 5 mg
three times a day , and Dilaudid p.r.n. p.o. Per pain consult , it
was suggested to change her antidepressant Prozac to Cymbalta 60
mg , this should be done with a taper of the Prozac and increasing
doses of Cymbalta. First start with 40 mg of Prozac and 10 mg of
Cymbalta then gradually increase the Cymbalta and decrease the
Prozac , to 30-20 , 20-30 , 10-40 , and then finally 60 mg Cymbalta.
Cymbalta has significant effects on diabetic neuropathic pain and
the patient would benefit largely from these measures. The
patient has pain consult setup with Dr. Branco at the Pain Clinic
here in the Kee Te Memorial Hospital on 8/11/06.
Obesity: The patient currently is morbid obese with a BMI of 50
which inhibits her abilities to care for herself , cleaning , and
going to the toilet , mobilization is difficult. The patient
would benefit from drastic dietetic weight loss programs/consider
GI surgical intervention to reduce appetite and help losing
weight.

Discharge Date: 6/11/2002
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS STASIS WITH
SUPERIMPOSED CELLULITIS.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS STASIS WITH
SUPERIMPOSED CELLULITIS , RESOLVED.
SERVICE: GENERAL MEDICAL Copeo
CONSULTS OBTAINED: Infectious Disease and Dermatology.
HISTORY: The patient is a 56 year old woman with chronic venous
stasis complicated by Psychiatric history , chronic
noncompliance , and visits to multiple care providers , readmitted
for painful , swollen , red , right lower extremity. The patient had
a previous episode of cellulitis of the right lower extremity in
July of 2002 treated at Istspauld Health with clindamycin ,
leading to a clostridium difficile colitis; previous episodes
resolved entirely. The patient now returned with a one week
history of increasing symptoms of the right lower extremity. She
reported positive subjective fevers as well as chills. She denied
nausea , vomiting , bright red blood per rectum , melena or chest
pain. The patient does report chronic abdominal pain , positive
dyspnea on exertion , but no dysuria.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature is 98.2 , pulse 87 , blood
pressure 134/69 , respirations 20/minute ,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Physical examination reveals a
morbidly obese middle aged female in no acute distress. The
patient is alert and oriented. Speech , however , is pressured and
tangential. The left lower extremity is remarkable for 1+ edema
and brawny hyperpigmentation below the knee. The right lower
extremity is erythematous and shiny below the knee with 2+ edema.
The extremity is very tender to the touch. On admission white
blood cell 8.6 , urinalysis 4+ squamous. A right lower extremity
x-ray revealed no bony abnormalities. Chest x-ray showed no
infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: From an I.D. standpoint , cellulitis was treated
with Ancef without improvement. Based on input
from the Infectious Disease Service the patient was switched to
intravenous vancomycin on August Blood cultures were negative
from February A repeat urinalysis was negative. A dermatology
consult was obtained on March and gave an impression of
cellulitis secondary to venous insufficiency and obesity and
possible tinea pedis. The consult recommended discontinuing
nystatin and triamcinolone with use of Spectazole and miconazole
between the toes on lower legs and inframammary b.i.d. On October Infectious Disease saw the patient and confirmed the impression
of cellulitis. They also voiced concern for adequate dosing of
vancomycin given the patient&apos;s size and to properly cover non
staphylococcal etiologies. The vancomycin dose was increased to
1.5 gram IV q. 12 hours and then to q. eight hours. On the 4 of October of
February the dorsum of the left foot was draining a serous fluid. At
the time a CT was also obtained which was negative for any fluid
collections. Debridement was not recommended at that time. The
patient at that time was still receiving levaquin. Dermatology saw
the patient on May once more and supported the diagnosis of
chronic venous stasis. From a hematologic standpoint , the
beginning of this day , the patient received lower extremity ,
noninvasive imaging to rule out deep venous thrombosis. These were
negative for deep venous thrombosis. From a psychiatric standpoint
the patient has an undifferentiated psychiatric disorder , most
possibly bipolar with a manic component but refused to see Psych
and instead insisted on taking Dexedrine for a claimed diagnosis of
narcolepsy. In the absence of prescription , the patient reportedly
took her own medications while in the hospital. The mental status
examination is significant for pressured speech , tangential in
nature and evidence of poor short-term memory. The patient lacks
any suicidal or homicidal ideation and does not appear to have any
psychotic component. From a cardiovascular and fluid standpoint ,
Lasix diuresis was attempted and a Foley catheter was placed.
Given that all of the involved sources believed that the most
fundamental cause for the patient&apos;s symptoms was fluid overload and
venous insufficiency in the lower extremities , aggressive diuresis
was continued , leading ultimately to a dose of 80 mg of Lasix
b.i.d. An echocardiogram on May showed right ventricular
dilatation without any compromise in function. From a
musculoskeletal standpoint the patient did suffer a fall while
standing on September She had no head trauma. She did complain
of some right knee pain without functional impairment. There was
no instability in the joint. The patient also later complained of
pain in the right foot , which he complained resulted from the fall.
However three views from the foot showed no evidence of fracture of
significant soft tissue disease. A chronic issue during the
patient&apos;s stay was her refusal to look forward to discharge despite
evidence that her acute issues had corrected and that improvement
of her chronic underlying condition would require comprehensive
therapy on a home and outpatient basis. By the 29 of October the
patient&apos;s cellulitis had resolved and this had been confirmed by
Infectious Disease reconsult. At that point only stasis dermatitis
continued. The vancomycin was therefore discontinued after
adequate antibiotic course. On September the lower extremity
continued to show improvement. On August the patient was
deemed ready for discharge. She was advanced to continue Lasix at
80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with potassium at 60 meq p.o. per day to replace
any losses. Other meds were prescribed as before. The patient was
also sent home with ketoconazole for a short course and a small
supply of oxycodone to control her pain until she could follow-up
wit her new outpatient provider Dr. Law at Ganco Wo Medical Center The
plan was to leave the patient&apos;s Foley catheter in because she had
persistent problems with urinary incontinence which predates this
hospital admission. The patient plans to see Urogynecologist , Dr.
Mihalko for this problem. We arranged outpatient follow-up
appointments for the patient with both of these doctors , Dr. Stechlinski
and Dr. Mccarter on November All of the information was
communicated verbally to the patient. The patient was advised to
take all medications as directed. We emphasized that it&apos;s very
important for her to elevate her legs regularly and to try to limit
soft drink intake as this was likely contributing to the swelling
in her legs. She was instructed to weight herself daily and to
contact her primary care physician if her weight was steadily
increasing. We advised her to seek medical attention for fever ,
increased redness or new pronounced swelling in her legs , any
numbness or tingling in her legs , new skin ulcers or any other
concerns.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Betoptic S eye drops 0.25% to the right
eye one drop b.i.d. , Klonopin 1 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride slow release 60
mEq p.o. daily , albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer inhaler 3/0.5

Discharge Date: 10/14/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN AND PRESYNCOPE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: ( 1 ) HYPERTENSION.
( 2 ) ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL.
( 3 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY ON
10/13/97.
( 4 ) STATUS POST BLADDER SUSPENSION SURGERY.
( 5 ) PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease who was admitted on 2/9/97 for bladder suspension surgery
to Tion Hospital The plan at that time was for a laparoscopic
procedure , but because of bladder puncture , it was converted to an
open procedure. She had ST depressions on EKG intraoperatively ,
and was admitted to the ICU there. She was treated for a
myocardial infarction and developed postmyocardial angina with EKG
changes which were unrelieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. For
this reason , she was started on IV TNG and transferred to Mead Ry&apos;sweeks Hospital And Medical Center for cardiac catheterization. She underwent cardiac
catheterization on 1/10/97 and this revealed three vessel disease.
She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 3/4/97 with a
LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , and SVG to OM1. Her postoperative course
was complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , with which she
was symptomatic. She was started on procainamide during the
admission and was discharged home on 1/4/97 with a subtherapeutic
proc/nepa level ( 3.0-4.5 ). She arrived home at 4:30 p.m. and felt
well until approximately 7:00 p.m. , when she developed acute onset
of 8 out of 10 chest pain across her entire chest radiating down
the left arm and associated with light-headedness and visual
changes. She reported this was similar to a prior anginal episode.
She took three sublingual nitroglycerin at home and had no relief.
EMTs were called and found the patient pale , diaphoretic , with
blood pressure 90/palp , and a heart rate of 150. She was treated
with more nitroglycerin and improved somewhat in terms of her pain.
She was taken to Aen Er/in Hospital where EKG showed rapid atrial
fibrillation with ST depressions globally. She was given IV fluids
and 750 mg of procainamide , as well as 20 mg of IV Cardizem and
nitroglycerin. Her pain resolved. Her systolic blood pressure
came up to the 110 range and her atrial fibrillation rate decreased
to the 80s. Subsequently , she converted into normal sinus rhythm
with a rate in the 60s and was transferred to the Hamren Ry County Medical Center for further treatment. Her pain lasted for approximately
one hour in total. On arrival to the Nal Vervmi Theast Medical Center on
the floor , she had 3 out of 10 chest pain , without shortness of
breath , presyncope or palpitations. This pain radiates to the back
and was reproducible with left-sided sternal pressure unlike her
prior anginal episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Hypertension; ( 2 ) High cholesterol;
( 3 ) Coronary artery disease status post CABG
on 3/4/97 with anatomy as described above; ( 4 ) Bladder suspension
surgery in 1995 and 1997; ( 5 ) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
perioperatively.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; ( 2 ) Percocet 1-2
tabs p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.; ( 3 ) Coumadin; ( 4 ) Axid 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; ( 5 ) cephradine 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. x7 days for wound
infection in the vein harvest site; ( 6 ) procainamide 750 mg p.o.
q.i.d. ( she was receiving 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. in hospital prior to
discharge ).
FAMILY HISTORY: History of a son with a myocardial infarction at
age 39 , brother with an MI at age 64 , and a mother
with an MI at age 64.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband at home and does not
smoke tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS - Heart rate 59 , BP 100/60 ,
respiratory rate 20 , sat 98 on three liters
with temp 97.7. GENERAL - She was an elderly woman in no acute
distress. HEENT - Oropharynx is benign. NECK - She has normal
jugular venous pressure at approximately 8 cm. CHEST - Clear to
auscultation and percussion. HEART - Remarkable for S1 and S2.
Regular rhythm , no murmurs. She had a surgical scar in the midline
which is healing without any pus or signs of inflammation. ABDOMEN
- Benign. She had a midline scar which was healing without
erythema or pus. EXTREMITIES - Revealed a left lower extremity
medial scar with erythema but no pus. She had left-sided edema , 2+
to the mid shin , but there was no edema on the right side. She had
1-2+ decreased pulses bilaterally. Her feet were cool but her
neurologic function was intact. She had normal capillary refill.
NEURO - Non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , with normal electrolytes.
She had a white count 15 and hematocrit 40. Her
LFTs were within normal limits , and her CK was 55. EKG , at the
time of admission here , showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 ,
with intervals of 0.2 , 0.08 , and 484. She had a left axis of -34
degrees and evidence of an old inferior MI. She had T-wave
inversions in lead I , L , V2-V6 , and II , and she had ST elevations
( slight ) in leads III and F ). These were unchanged during her
episode of chest pain upon arrival compared with her EKG from the
morning of discharge.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In short , this was a 72-year-old woman who was
status post coronary artery bypass grafting 12
days prior to admission , who was now readmitted within four hours
of discharge because of rapid atrial fibrillation and chest pain
lasting for an hour.
She was admitted and found to be in normal sinus rhythm at the time
of admission. Her procainamide was increased to 750 mg p.o. q.i.d.
given that her levels of proc/nepa were subtherapeutic at the time
of discharge earlier in the day. Given her history of one hour of
chest pain , she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial
CKs which were flat. However , her troponin came back at 5.1 the
following morning. It rapidly trended downward , and so it was
unclear as to whether she had actually suffered any myocardial
damage. Other possible explanations for her chest pain included:
Question of pericarditic , post-pericardiotomy pain vs. coronary
disease vs non-cardiac causes. In addition , at the time of
admission , she had an Infectious Disease issue and her white blood
cell count was elevated at the outside hospital , and there was some
erythema around her left leg site.
On hospital day #2 , she had an episode of atrial fibrillation at a
rate of 140-150 with symptoms of palpitation but no chest pain.
Her proc and nepa levels were therapeutic at this time ( 6.0-9.0 ).
On the following day , she had an episode of atypical chest pain
without EKG changes and which was different from her prior angina.
The following evening , she had an additional episode of chest pain.
At this time , she had a heart rate of approximately 160 and was
found to be in atrial fibrillation with no ST-T wave changes. This
episode resolved with 2.5 mg of IV Lopressor within 10 minutes.
On 11/17/97 , she underwent an echocardiogram which showed a normal
LV size , with mild concentric hypertrophy. There was normal
systolic function and an ejection fraction of 66% , with inferior
hypokinesis. Based on this information , it was decided that the
patient probably did not have an MI. At this time , the decision
was made that she had failed procainamide , as she had now broke
through several times with atrial fibrillation , well therapeutic on
the procainamide. The procainamide was discontinued and she was
loaded on amiodarone at a dosage of 600 mg p.o. t.i.d. x13 doses.
On 10/10/97 , she underwent an ETT MIBI which showed mild
peri-infarct ischemia but no ST-T wave changes and the patient had
no symptoms at nine minutes on a submax Bruce.
At the time of discharge , she remained on amiodarone at a dose of
200 mg p.o. q.d. and she has been restarted on her Coumadin for
which she will be followed by the Anticoagulation Service. At the
time of discharge , she has been in normal sinus rhythm for over 36
hours. Her other issues during this hospitalization having
included infectious disease for which she was on cephradine because
of some wound site erythema and an elevated white blood cell count
at an outside hospital. She was treated with five days of
cephradine and remained afebrile. In addition , she was started on
levofloxacin for concern about a UTI , given her complaints of
urinary frequency. However , it is more likely that this urinary
frequency is related to her underlying urologic problems. In terms
of her anticoagulation , she was maintained on a IV heparin while
not on Coumadin. She is restarting with careful recoumadinization
given the fact that she is now on amiodarone.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) amiodarone
200 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 3 ) atenolol 100 mg p.o.
q.d.; ( 4 ) Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 5 ) sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n.; ( 6 ) Coumadin as directed; ( 7 ) Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
( 8 ) Ativan 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. anxiety; ( 9 ) Premarin
0.625 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 10 ) Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. She has now
been in sinus rhythm for over 36 hours. It seems likely that she
will not require long-term amiodarone or Coumadin.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her
cardiologist , Dr. Harry Finnila , so that the
decision can be made as to when she may stop taking her amiodarone
and Coumadin.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home on
4/2/97.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.

Discharge Date: 3/15/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Gastroenteritis , resolved. Atypical chest
pain , GI versus cardiac.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Dodd is a 60 year woman with
past medical history significant for
diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , smoking ,
gastroesophageal reflux and hypertension. Two days prior to
admission , she ate some Chinese food in the evening and felt some
mild stomach upset. One day prior to admission , she ate the
leftovers of this Chinese food and again , felt stomach upset. A
short time later , she began vomiting food and water but no blood.
This continued , up to and including the day of admission. She
developed some left sided epigastric pain under her left ribs and
in her left upper quadrant. This radiated to her back but nowhere
else. She cannot describe the pain other than to say it is &quot;really
bad.&quot;
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for shortness of breath walking up her
15 stairs and shortness of breath with doing
dishes , requiring a break every fifteen minutes.
In the emergency department , she continued to have emesis of small
amounts of clear fluid and food. She had one episode of witnessed
emesis of small clumps of red blood in the emergency department.
During one episode of emesis , she had abdominal pain which she
described as radiating also to her left chest and this was relieved
with two sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , plus remote history of peptic
ulcer disease.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient came to this country from Iowa
when she was 38 years old. She is a retired
domestic worker. She is widowed and lives with her daughter. She
has a home health aid three times a week. The patient has smoked
one pack per day of cigarettes for twenty years.
ALLERGIES: Contrast dye causes a rash and itching.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Insulin NPH 44 units q. a.m. , 22 units
q. p.m. , Insulin regular 14 units q.
a.m. , 5 units q. p.m. , Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q. day , Lisinopril 20 mg
p.o. q. day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Afebrile , pulse 66 , blood
pressure 142/50 , respiratory
rate of 12 , oxygen saturation 98% on two liters. In general , the
patient is a comfortable , mildly heavy woman. She has moist mucous
membranes. There is no jugular venous distention. Her lungs are
clear in all fields. Her heart is in a regular rate and rhythm ,
with somewhat distant heart sounds. There is no murmur heard.
Her abdomen is completely benign , with good bowel sounds. Her
liver and spleen are not palpable. There is no peripheral edema.
LABORATORIES: Admission EKG revealed a normal axis , normal sinus
rhythm , with some mild T-wave flattening in V5 and
V6. Chest x-ray on admission was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was started on
intravenous Heparin in the emergency department
and written for rule out MI protocol. Her CKs were mildly
elevated , between 500 and 600 , with normal MB fractions. Her
troponin levels did not reveal any evidence of cardiac ischemia or
injury. The Heparin was stopped after she ruled out for myocardial
infarction. She continued to have some mild abdominal pain ,
however these episodes were always associated with concurrent
nausea and vomiting. The abdominal pain was immediately relieved
after she vomited. This resolved after three days , and she was
scheduled for an exercise treadmill test with MIBI. The patient
went six minutes on a manual protocol treadmill. She went at a
slow rate and did not complete stage one. She had 1/2 to 1 mm SP
depressions which were flat in one to two leads. She had some
vague chest heaviness , which technically qualified as symptomatic ,
however the technician stated that there suspicion was that it was
more fatigue. Because the chest was formally positive but with
still no suspicion for significant ischemia , a MIBI scan was
performed. This demonstrated mild ischemia with exercise in 4 of
25 inferior segments only. After her GI distress resolved , the
patient had no further episodes of chest pain. Although the
patient may have some coronary artery disease , it is not felt that
this is actively symptomatic in her. She will be followed up in
clinic and started on beta-blocker and/or nitrates if she has clear
symptoms of anginal pain.
Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with obvious
gastroenteritis. She did not have any diarrhea with these
episodes. She was treated with a mild diet and antiemetics as
needed. Her GI symptoms resolved after three days and she is
eating well at the time of discharge. She was started on
omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day for her heartburn pain.
Diabetes: The patient was followed during this admission by Dr.
Walezak , her primary endocrinologist. Her blood sugar controls
while here were excellent. She was given a container for a routine
24 hour urine collection for protein , to be completed as an
outpatient.
Health Maintenance: The patient was started on Nicoderm patches
and advised to stop smoking. She received her flu shot while here.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. Insulin
NPH 35 units q. a.m. , 18 units q. p.m.. Insulin
regular sliding scale q. a.c. and q. h.s.. Insulin regular 12
units q. a.m. , 5 units q. p.m.. Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q. day.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , COPD ,
hypertension , diabetes mellitus , gout , hypercholesterolemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old female
with a history of hypertension , renal artery stenosis , diabetes ,
chronic renal insufficiency , and COPD who presents with 3 days of
increasing shortness of breath. The patient reports that over
the 3 days prior to admission. She had increased shortness of
breath and worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline , she can
usually walk a block before becoming short of breath and over
these past few days , she can no longer walk several feet. She
also reports that she has a productive cough with whitish sputum
and recently recovered from an upper respiratory tract infection
3 weeks ago. She denies any chest pain , palpitations , or
lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , and diaphoresis. She has had
stable 3-pillow orthopnea for many years with no recent increase
in lower extremity edema. She does note a 5-pound weight gain
over the past week prior to admission. The patient had been
followed recently as an outpatient by both cardiology and renal
for her hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. She has
known renal artery stenosis by MRI in February 2004 and recently
had an episode of acute renal insufficiency with an increase in
her creatinine from 1.6 to 2.7 in the setting of Lasix and
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient has been taking
extra Lasix. So in the week prior to admission , she had run out
of this medication. In the emergency room , the patient was
hypertensive and in mild respiratory distress ( 92% on room air ).
She was given nebulizers and Lasix 80 mg IV with a diuresis of
1.5 liters. In the emergency room , she describes some left-sided
chest pain , worse with inspiration , which lasted a few minutes
with some associated nausea and vomiting. An EKG showed ST
depressions in leads V2 through V6.

home. She has a history of tobacco , 30-pack-year and quit in
1968. She denies alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , pulse 59 ,
blood pressure 160/70 , respirations 20 , O2 sat 99% on 2 liters.
The patient was alert and in no acute distress. JVP 8 cm.
Pupils equal and reactive to light. Extraocular movements
intact. Oropharynx clear. Neck is supple. Cardiovascular: 2/6
systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Respiratory:
Left-sided crackle. Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended
with normal active bowel sounds. Extremities: Trace pedal
edema. Neurovascular: The patient was alert and oriented x3
with a nonfocal neurologic exam.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a BUN of 40 and a creatinine
of 1.6 ( this is decreased from 2.7 in October 2005 ). BNP was 95.
CK 95 , troponin negative. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with
PACs. Normal axis , ST depressions in V2 through V6. Chest x-ray
showed a left lower lobe infiltrate/opacity. No effusions , no
edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient with shortness of
breath on admission and ST depression in V2 through V6. The
patient had an episode of chest pain at rest on the floor with a
positive troponin to 10.8 on 7/26/2005. No progression of the
EKG changes seen in the emergency room. The patient was started
on IV heparin and cardiology was called to arrange for cardiac
catheterization. However , the patient was noted to have a
decrease in her hematocrit from 30 to 23. She was guaiac
negative. Cath was initially put on hold for the patient to be
transfused. The patient then became chest pain free starting
10/7/2005. Her enzymes trended down. IV heparin was
discontinued on 6/18/2005. The patient had a MIBI on
5/1/2005 , which showed areas of ischemia in the distal LAD and
OM territories. The patient underwent catheterization on
1/23/2005 , which showed chronically occluded RCA with collateral
50% LAD lesion , 95% tubular proximal D1 lesion , 50% tubular OM1
lesion; no stents were placed. She was continued on aspirin ,
beta-blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor. The patient had one
additional episode of chest pain on 1/21/2005. In this instance
chest pain was pleuritic with no associated ischemic symptoms and
EKG remained unchanged. This was thought unlikely to be of
ischemic origin. The patient has no chest pain or shortness of
breath since this time up until the time of discharge. Pump:
The patient was felt to be volume overloaded on admission
( secondary to Lasix noncompliance. The patient was initially
given 80 mg of IV Lasix with a diuresis of 1.5 liters. Diuresis
was then more gentle with an I/O goal of even to negative 500 cc
per day. Lasix was held prior to cath. The patient was thought
to be dry status post her large diuresis. The patient will
resume her Lasix at a lower dose of 40 mg q.d. on discharge. A
transthoracic echo on 10/9/2005 showed an EF of 65-70% , mild
hypokinesis of the distal anterior and septal walls , trace MR ,
mild AI and aortic stenosis ( aortic valve area 0.9 to 1.0 ). The
patient also has a history of hypertension with known unilateral
renal artery stenosis. The patient was initially on lisinopril ,
nicardipine , clonidine patch , and Imdur. The patient&apos;s ACE
inhibitor was held prior to cath because she was persistently
hyperkalemic. Her systolic blood pressure remained between
130-160. The patient will be discharged on a lower dose of
lisinopril ( with close followup by her primary care physician ).
Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry. She showed
sinus bradycardia in the 40s to 60s with first-degree block. The
patient was asymptomatic.
2. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath on admission thought to be a
combination of COPD , recent upper respiratory infection with
question of a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray as well
as volume overload. The patient was continued on her nebulizers.
She was also diuresed. She also completed a course of
azithromycin/cefotaxime for community-acquired pneumonia. Her
shortness of breath greatly improved since the time of admission.
Her oxygen saturation was 99-100% on room air ( and with
ambulation ) at the time of discharge.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency , microalbuminuria , and renal artery stenosis. She
had a recent episode of acute renal failure in the setting of
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Her creatinine was 1.8 to
2.0 through most of this admission. She underwent renal artery
angiography on 1/23/2005 , which shows moderate stenosis of the
right renal artery. No stent was placed. She was given
Kayexalate as needed for hyperkalemia. Her ACE inhibitor was
held temporarily and restarted at a lower dose given
hyperkalemia. Her K was 4.6 at the time of discharge. In
addition to the patient&apos;s ACE inhibitor , Lasix , allopurinol , and
colchicine were held prior to cardiac catheterization. She was
given Mucomyst and intravenous fluids around the time of her
catheterization. Her creatinine improved after cath hydration to
1.6 on the day of discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. She was
continued on Lantus with an insulin sliding scale.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complained of right great toe
pain. This was thought to be a bunion versus the patient&apos;s gout.
Given increased redness , warmth , and swelling the patient was
treated for a gout flare. She was given colchicine ( renally
dosed ) and continued on her prophylactic allopurinol. Both of
these medications were held prior to cath. NSAIDs were avoided
given renal insufficiency. The patient was given Tylenol for
pain with good effect. The patient showed decreased pain and
swelling of her right great toe over the course of this admission
and this was resolved on discharge. The patient will be
continued on renally dose prophylactic allopurinol.
5. Heme: The patient had a drop in hematocrit on 9/30 from 30
to 23. She was guaiac negative. She was transfused and then
maintained to hematocrit of approximately 30 since 10/7/2005.
Her post cath hematocrit was 27.9 ( repeated at 28.9 ). Her groin
site was clean , dry , and intact. No tenderness over the abdomen
and flank.
6. Prophylaxis: Nexium and subcu. heparin.
7. Code was full.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. She will
follow up with her primary care physician. She was also
instructed to avoid foods that were high in salt and potassium.
She was instructed to keep track of her daily weight.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.

delivery times three , one miscarriage
and two therapeutic abortions.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The patient is on no medications.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to seaweed.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Reveals smoking of one pack per day , occasional
alcohol , no intravenous drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese female in some
discomfort , belching. Vital signs:
Temperature 98.4 degrees , blood pressure 162/60 which then became
152/85 and then 145/85 , heart rate 88-108 , respiratory rate 20 ,
oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The patient has numerous dental
caries. She has anicteric sclera. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation. Heart was regular rate and rhythm with normal heart
sounds. She is obese , gravid with positive bowel sounds. She is
generally tender to deep palpation , slightly right greater than
left , no rebound or guarding. Extremities reveal no clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema. Neurological examination was 1-2+ throughout.
Cervix was 1 cm , closed and posterior. Rectal examination revealed
normal tone , guaiac negative. Fetal heart rate was in the 140-150s
with average variability , not formally reactive. She had no
contractions on the monitor.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory studies revealed a white blood
cell count of 17.7 , hematocrit 37.1 , platelets 289.
SMA-7 was within normal limits. Liver function tests was within
normal limits. Amylase 55 , lipase 23 , calcium 8.9 , uric acid 2.3.
A urinalysis clean catch revealed 3+ protein , trace glucose with
30-35 white blood cells , 1-2 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria and 1+
squamous epithelial cells. Urine tox was negative. Floor
ultrasound with anterior placenta , BPP six out of eight.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 35 year-old female , G7 , P3-1-2-3 at
33.2 weeks by a formal ultrasound is admitted
with abdominal pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Abdominal pain: Because the patient had
anorexia , abdominal pain and also some nausea
as well as increased white blood cell count , a Surgery consult was
obtained. They suggested that the patient remain NPO with
intravenous hydration and to follow her serial white counts as well
as serial examinations to rule out appendicitis. The patient was
hungry on the evening of admission. She was given a diet and was
tolerating without any problems. At the time her abdominal
examination was benign. Her white blood cell count went from a
high of 17.7 down to 11.9. At the time of dictation , the current
one is still pending. There does not appear to be any evidence of
appendicitis. There also does not appear to be any evidence of
preterm labor.
2 ) Rule out PET: We do not have the patient&apos;s book in blood
pressures since she had no prenatal care , however no admission her
initial blood pressure was 162/60 and with 3+ protein , the patient
was assessed regarding rule out pre-eclampsia. She had no symptoms
during the admission , however did report some headaches recently
and maybe some spotty vision. However , it is reassuring that she
had none of these complaints during the admission. Her blood
pressures on the floor have been reassuring with a blood pressure
maximum when she is on the Fuller Service of 140/70. The patient&apos;s
PET laboratory studies were reassuring and the baby has normal
fluid. The patient is currently undergoing 24 hour urine protein
and further determination will be made from then. It is expected
that the patient will be discharged , feeling that the proteinuria
is from her vaginitis.
3 ) No prenatal care: The patient had her initial prenatal
laboratory studies drawn and also a glucose loading test done on
this admission. The results are pending at this time. The patient
will be discharged to the regular OB clinic for an appointment in
the next one to two days.
4 ) Trichomonas vaginitis: A straight catheter urinalysis was
resent which revealed 60-65 white blood cells , 4+ Trichomonas as
well as hyfe and 2+ squamous epithelial cells. The patient was
given 2 grams of Flagyl times one. She is advised to tell her
partner so that he may receive some medical care and receive
treatment also. She is advised not to have intercourse with him
until he is treated.
5 ) Contraception: The patient desired postpartum sterilization
and during this admission signed PPS forms.
6 ) Morbid obesity: The patient will need an Anesthesia consult as
an outpatient secondary to her body habitus.
7 ) Social work: The patient revealed that she did not want her
husband to know that she was pregnant. We had a social worker come
and discuss with her regarding further plans.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
*HPI:58 yo F with chest pain , known CAD ( s/p inferior wall MI &apos;91 ) , multiple
cardiac RF ( HTN , DM2 , HChol , recent smoker , Fam Hx ) , also with hiatal
hernia , ?breast cysts , chronic pain syndrome. Pt presents with stabbing
chest pain with radiation down L arm ( which is unlike her anginal CP ) ,
feeling of chest &quot;tightness&quot; and ?diaphoresis and SOB. This pain has been
persistent for 1.5 weeks , worsening/persistent x 24 hours.
*PMH: CAD s/p PCI 1992 , HTN , DM , dyslipidemia , gastritis , depression , OA ,
hiatal hernia , chronic pain syndrome
*MEDS: avandia 8 mg po bid , atenolol 100 mg po bid , lipitor 20 mg po qhs ,
zestril 40 mg po qd , asa 81 mg po qd , percocet prn
*ALLERGIES: erythromycin , pcn , motrin?
*SH: d/c smoking 3 yrs ago , no etoh , no ivdu/recreational drugs , lives with
her husband
*PE on admission: remarkable for marked chest wall tenderness , and mild
fluid overload by JVP of ~10cm , S4 on cardiac auscultation , 1+ peripheral
edema , and dyspnea with occasional expiratory wheezing.
*LABS/STUDIES: Admission studies showed BNP of 809; CXR wnl , EKG unchanged
from previous , negative cardiac enzymes x3.
**********HOSPITAL COURSE************
*Chest discomfort: It was felt that her chest symptoms were not angina but
possibly represented bronchospasm , or fluid overload secondary to
diastolic dysfunction. TTE was therefore performed on 6/21 and showed ED
60% , LVH , and small area of HK on inferior wall. Dipyridamole-PET done
4/19 showed small severe fixed perfusion defect in inferior wall , but was
otherwise unremarkable. Given the patient&apos;s fluid overload and possible
diastolic dysfunction , she was given a total of 60 mg IV Lasix and over
10/13/4 diuresed approximately 1 L negative. Clinical improvement was
observed on 6/10 To treat possible bronchospasm she was given
atrovent/albuterol by MDI qid. On 11/16 improvement was noted with respect
to her dyspnea , wheezing , and chest &quot;tightness&quot; , and she was switched to
po Lasix 80 mg. She was discharged with instructions to monitor daily
weights and take po Lasix 40 mg , with followup with her PCP/outpatient
cardiologist Dr. Oviedo
*Secondary prevention: the patient&apos;s admission lipid profile returned LDL
of 107; her statin dose was increased to Simvastatin 80 mg ( and she was
discharged with Lipitor 40 mg ). Her blood pressure remained within
normal limits after increasing her lisinopril dose to 40 bid , she was
discharged with this new dose. The patient remained on telemetry over
her hospital course with no issues.
*Anemia: The patient&apos;s admission Hct was 32.8 ( baseline of 40 ) and the
patient was asymptomatic from this standpoint. Iron studies were sent and
showed low-normal serum iron of 38 , with iron sat of 12%. She was
discharged with Niferex 150 mg bid and ascorbic acid 500 mg bid x 1month ,
to be followed up with her PCP.
*Pain: Throughout her hospital course , the patient&apos;s chronic pain ,
headache , and chest pain was managed with her home regimen of Percocet
5/325 qid and acetaminophen prn.
*Endo: Her blood sugars remained in excellent control with home dose of
Avandia 8 bid. A mildly enlarged thyroid was noted but her TSH was wnl at
0.715.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you are
experiencing persistent chest pain , shortness of breath ,
lightheadedness/dizziness , and/or palpitations.

Discharge Date: 6/14/1995
IDENTIFICATION: This is a 65 year old woman with a history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and
cerebrovascular accident , admitted with new onset renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65 year old woman with a
history of insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , cerebrovascular accident , and congestive heart failure.
She went for a regular clinic appointment the day of admission and
vomited. Primary M.D. diagnosed hypotension and dehydration and
referred her to Ingsricejean Ton Isrop Medical Center Emergency Room. On
arrival to the Emergency Room she complained of loose stools per
her ostomy times three weeks. She had a diverting transverse
colostomy secondary to a perirectal abscess. She also was passing
loose stool per rectum. She vomited two times in the week prior to
admission. Creatinine was noted to be 5.0 with a history of
creatinine of 3.3 in January of 1995 and 1.5 in February of 1994. She
notes her urine output has not changed in the past few weeks. She
reports having Foley in place for about a month after surgery for
the perirectal abscess , in October of 1995. She had pain and
bleeding after discontinuation of the Foley. In the winter of 1994
the patient had increasing creatinine and was seen at Coleling Pala Medical Center She was told she had NSAID
induced acute renal failure. Creatinine decreased after Motrin was
discontinued.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has a past medical history of
hypertension since 1978 , insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , initially treated with oral medication ,
cerebrovascular accident in 1994 , a right posterior parietal , right
frontal lobe , bilateral cerebellar attenuation , arthritis , history
of Motrin use which was discontinued in the winter of 1994 , a
questionable history of arrhythmias , positive PPD diagnosed in 1993
which was treated with INH , history of bilateral deep venous
thrombosis in May of 1995 , secondary to postoperative bedrest , an
ostomy for perirectal abscess in October of 1995 , and history of
congestive heart failure in October of 1995 , for which she was
intubated.
MEDICATIONS: Medications include Cardizem 120 q day ,
Hydrochlorothiazide 50 q day , Vasotec 20 b.i.d. ,
Clonidine 0.5 b.i.d. , NPH 18 units q.a.m. , and Coumadin 3 mg p.o.
q.h.s.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has no history of tobacco or alcohol use.
She lives with her daughter and has VNA and Home
Health Aide q day.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of a myocardial infarction at
40 years of age , positive hypertension and
diabetes. Mother died of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature is 96 , heart rate 68 ,
respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 96/54 ,
and she was 98 percent on room air. Significant findings on
physical examination included her chest being clear to
auscultation. Her cardiac examination showed a regular rate and
rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdominal examination was
soft , non-tender , non-distended , and obese with good bowel sounds.
Colostomy was in place , pink and bag had loose stool. Rectal was
guaiac negative. Extremities showed trace pedal edema.
Neurological was grossly intact. Strength in her upper extremities
was 3/5 and lower extremities was 4/5.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs on admission showed a sodium of 139 ,
potassium of 4.5 , chloride of 105 , bicarbonate
14 , BUN 102 , and creatinine of 4.7. Anion gap was 20. White count
was 7 , hematocrit 39 , and platelets were 283 , 000. EKG showed a
normal sinus rhythm at 75 with normal intervals and no acute ST-T
wave changes. Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Acute renal failure - This was felt to be
secondary , most likely , to dehydration from viral
enteritis , superimposed on chronic renal insufficiency , secondary
to hypertension and diabetes. Her Hydrochlorothiazide and Vasotec
were discontinued. She was given gentle IV hydration with half
normal saline. Creatinine was seen to be decreasing. The
patient&apos;s creatinine gradually decreased and was 1.6 at discharge.
This was to be followed up as an outpatient. ( 2 ) GI - It was felt
that the patient had viral enteritis. Stool cultures were all
negative. Gradually the patient began to have less diarrhea and
was able to take good p.o. intake. This was stable at discharge.
( 3 ) Deep venous thrombosis - The patient&apos;s INR on admission was
4.8. Therefore , her Coumadin was held for several days and at
discharge her INR was 2.2. ( 4 ) Surgery - The patient was evaluated
by DDT Service while in the hospital and it was felt that
eventually the patient would have a take-down of her colostomy and
would reevaluate once the patient was medically stable as an
outpatient.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Discharge medications included
Cardizem CD 120 mg q day , NPH insulin 9
units subcutaneous q.a.m. , Clonidine 0.5 mg p.o. q day , cisapride
10 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Vasotec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Coumadin 3 mg
p.o. q.h.s.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to follow up in

other brother , Merrill Luersen , is also involved in her care and can
be reached at 561-831-3385.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 97.5 , pulse 42 , blood pressure 107/58 , respirations
20 , and oxygen saturation 97%. In general , this is an obese
female , she is Spanish-speaking mostly. She appears unkempt and
in discomfort somewhat because of her right knee pain. She is no
acute distress. Cardiovascular exam shows bradycardia , with
normal S1 and S2 , and 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at
the left upper sternal border. Her chest exam showed some low
soft rumbling sounds with inspiration and expiration , otherwise ,
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was distended and
obese. There are positive bowel sounds , and no palpable liver
and spleen. Extremity exam showed uncut nails on upper and lower
extremities bilaterally. Her right leg was greater in size than
her left , however , both show significant 2-3+ pitting edema. On
the right ankle area , there appears to be chronic venous stasis
changes with hyperpigmented patch on the lower extremity. There
are less chronic venous stasis changes on the left lower
extremity. There was some mild erythema around the right knee.
This area of redness was poorly demarcated and mildly blanching.
There was painful passive motion on her right knee. Neuro exam
was grossly intact and nonfocal. She did have a coarse tremor in
her upper and lower extremities when asked to use these
extremities for motion.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA:
Electrolytes were significant for a potassium of 5.8 and a
creatinine of 1.6 that was raised from previous creatinine in
2004 of 1.0. Her liver enzymes were unremarkable. Her
hematocrit was 45.5. A UA done on admission was bland , however ,
urine cultures grew greater than a 1000 CFU/mL of coag-negative
Staphylococcus. Her right knee film showed mild effusion , no
fracture. This effusion was tapped and showed 20 white blood
cells , 810 red blood cells. Of the white blood cells , 21% were
PMNs and 75% were lymphocytes. There were no crystals seen.
There were no organisms seen.
ASSESSMENT:
Ms. Fought is a 50-year-old female with a history of bipolar
disorder , schizophrenia , obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension ,
and diabetes , was admitted for one week of worsening right knee
redness , swelling and pain causing immobility.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/PROBLEM:
1. Leg swelling: The differential diagnosis that was considered
for her leg swelling included deep venous thrombosis versus
cellulitis versus septic joints versus gout versus chronic
lymphedema with an acute worsening. Infectious causes were
considered less likely given the fact that the patient&apos;s white
count was not significantly elevated , ( it was 10.5 with 75%
polys , and 80% lymphs ) , and in fact that she has not had any
fever. The patient was treated empirically , however , as this
diagnosis was unable to be ruled out initially with vancomycin
and Unasyn and then with levofloxacin. The patient was treated
with therapeutic doses of heparin because of the concern of pain
and swelling asymmetrically of the lower extremities. This
continued until lower extremity Doppler studies showed no deep
venous thrombosis in the right femoral or left popliteal veins.
Uric acid levels were checked and shown to be elevated at 8.6 and
again at 8.0. These values suggest that gout may be involved in
this problem , however , there are no crystals and the synovial
fluid making this diagnosis also less likely. Over her hospital
course , the swelling , tenderness and redness of the right knee
decreased significantly. However , the patient&apos;s left knee began
to cause her significant pain , requiring oxycodone , Tylenol and
lidocaine patch. Because of concerning renal function with a
creatinine of 1.6 from 1.0 , NSAIDs were held initially , however ,
her creatinine trended down to 1.2 on the day of discharge , and
so she will be discharged with NSAIDs , which are expected to help
her musculoskeletal pain. While in the hospital , she received
Physical Therapy who evaluated the patient and suggested that the
patient would benefit from continued direct physical therapy to
address functional mobility retraining. Short-terms goals
included ambulate 50 feet with minimal assistance with
restrictive device , and to tolerate out of bed to chair for 30
minutes with reports of fatigue.
2. Lithium toxicity: Because of the patient&apos;s coarse tremor ,
bradycardia , hypotension , and the fact that she was taking
lithium , encouraged her lithium level to be checked which came
back elevated at 2.7 , ( normal levels between 0.5 and 1.3 ). This
level was concerning because lithium has a very narrow
therapeutic window. Her lithium was held and she was treated
with IV fluids , which allowed her creatinine to decrease. It was
thought that she was also somewhat dehydrated on presentation to
the emergency department. Her lithium toxicity could in part
explain for her bradycardia and hypotension as well as her
hypokalemia and renal failure. A psych consult was obtained to
address the question of when and how to restart the lithium. The
psych consultant suggested to check lithium levels daily until
they fell below 0.5 and then should restart the lithium at 300 mg
at bedtime. On the day of discharge , her lithium level was at
1.12. This level should be checked at the nursing facility and
lithium should be restarted at 300 mg at bedtime when the level
is 0.5 or below.
3. Cardiovascular: From a pump standpoint , the patient was
hypovolemic and hypotensive on presentation to the emergency
department. She responded well to normal saline fluid boluses
and given a total of 3 liters over her hospital course. From a
rhythm standpoint , the patient&apos;s bradycardia was resolved of
either over beta blockade or lithium toxicity. Her beta-blocker
was held as well as her lithium and her heart rate improved to
the 50 and 60s. We would recommend holding the beta-blocker
until follow up at her primary care physician&apos;s office for her
next appointment. From an ischemia standpoint , EKG was performed
which was a poor study that showed perhaps some T-wave inversions
in aVL. However , ACS is unlikely at this time. The patient had
no chest pain.
4. Renal: Acute renal failure on presentation with a creatinine
of 1.6 and 1.0 is likely prerenal versus lithium toxicity versus
a combination of these. A creatinine improved to 1.2 on the day
of discharge.
5. Endocrinology: The patient had a history of diabetes
according to her medical records. Her glucose while admitted
here was in between 90 and 132. These were random glucose draws.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked which came back at 6.2. At this
time , diabetes may or may not be an appropriate diagnosis for her
and she should follow up with her primary care physician with a
fasting blood glucose test.
6. Infectious disease: On initial presentation , the patient
presented with hypotension in the setting of bradycardia and beta
blockade with decreased volume status. There was a concern
initially that this may be cellulitis and she was covered broadly
with Unasyn and vancomycin. However , as she improved , and the
redness and swelling decreased , she was switched to levofloxacin
and committed to complete a seven-day course. She will complete
six more days after discharge from the hospital of levofloxacin.
7. Deconditioning: As mentioned above , Physical Therapy was
consulted and the patient will go to nursing facility for a
temporary rehabilitation. Upon discharge to her home from rehab ,
home safety evaluation should take place to make sure that the
patient is okay to go back home and can give the services that
she needs.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
2. Klonopin 1 mg p.o. at bedtime.
3. Oxycodone 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain , please hold
if respiration rate is less than 12.
4. Risperdal 0.5 mg p.o. at bedtime.
5. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily for six days after the day of
discharge from Wilgeimante Eycis Health on 3/18/05.
6. Ibuprofen 600 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged in stable condition to a nursing
facility. Please draw blood for lithium level checks daily until
it is below 0.5 , at which time , she should be restarted on
lithium 300 mg p.o. at bedtime. She will follow up with her
primary care physician , Dr. Aurelio Gilberto Hencheck at Li County Hospital , phone number is 875-800-5169. A message
was left in the voice mail of her physician&apos;s office to schedule
her an appointment and to contact her brother , Oren Dad , at
phone number 919-737-1462 or 180-116-0215 , or Daren Perella at
354-673-2223 to inform them at when the appointment will be. It
was requested that she be seen within two to three weeks.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is an 80 yo woman with a hx of CAD s/p MI in 1988 , 1991 , HTN
who presents with chest pain. She had prior MI , last in 1991 and since
then has been chest pain free. The day of admission , she had severe
retrosternal chest pain ( as she reports , similar to her prior angina
but not as severe ) and went to a local hospital. EKG and enzymes
negative , but CXR showed widened mediastinum. There was concern for
dissection , so she underwent CT which was read as positive for
dissection in ascending aorta. She was transferred to ISCH CCU for
further care. Repeat CT here showed no dissection but did show
extensive calficiations and luminal disease of the aorta. She was chest
pain free here until 6/9 AM when she had chest pain again with ST
depressions in V3-V6 at rest. She was made pain free with nitro and
heparin and transferred to the cardiology floor with presumed unstable
angina given her anginal pain , EKG ischemia changes , but lack of
elevated cardiac enzymes. Echo 6/22/03 demonstrated EF 65% with no
RWMA , no aortic root dissection , no effusion , and normal RV function.
1. CV: On 11/19/03 , cardiac catheterization was performed via radial
approach which revealed 3 vessel coronary disease with 90%
proximal LAD lesion followed by aneursymal segment and subsequent
90% lesion , diffuse non critical LAD disease distally , occluded
and collateralized D1 , occluded and collateralized OM2 , anterior
takeoff RCA with serial non-critical lesions and a mid 70% lesion.
The LAD was stented with a 18mm X 2.5mm Cypher stent with good
results. Patient will be continued on ASA , plavix , statin , metoprolol ,
and lisinopril will be started here ( nitrates will be discontinued ).
Integrillin was also give pericatheterization for 16 hours. Fasting
lipid profile on 3/18 revealed Triglycerides of 122 , HDL 28 ( low ) and
normal cholesterol ( 122 ) , CLDL , VLDL
2. Renal: Patient received mucomyst prior to the contrast CT here which
was continued for her cardiac catheterization. Her renal function
remained stable and normal throughout her hospital stay.
3. GU: She has a history of recurrent UTIs and has been on bactrim
prophylaxis here. Urine cultures on 6/9 and 10/19 have been negative.
4. Dispo: She is being discharged in stable condition with instruction
to follow up with her PCP ( Dr. Alejandro Linkon ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: VNA instruction for BP checks and Physical Therapy
For patient: please continue to take plavix for at least 1 year and
work w/ PCP/Cardiologist whether or not to continue indefinitely

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
69 y/o woman with CAD s/p 4v-CABG , asthma , obesity and likely
consequent restrictive lung disease , OSA , diastolic dysfunction , IDDM
with retinopathy , presenting with 1 week increased SOB and 3 days of
pleuritic chest pain. SOB at 1 step is increased from baseline DOE
over the last week. Also with deep substernal chest pain x 3days which
may have been pleuritic and was necessarily exertional. Different pain
than anginal pain. Always slightly orthopneic , +LEE bilaterally. No
f/c/s. Some cough nonproductive . No sore throat or sick contacts. In
ED 97.8 70 150/70 100%2LNC.
Pain completely resolved with NTG x3 and ASA. Exam: Obese , midline
ventral hernia. JVP 11.
?lower lobe crackles. 2+ bilat LEE ( slight L&gt;R ). Cr 1.4 baseline.
Hct 34 baseline. WBC 8.2. enzymes neg x2. BNP 108 EKG with no changes
( ?old q wave ). CXR hard to interpret.
The differential diagnosis of the patient&apos;s chest pain included
cardiac ischemia , GI and PE. We ruled out ischemia and PE as causes dur
ing this admission , the pt attributes her symptoms to large vental
hernia , making it difficult for her to breathe.
PULM: She had a PE
CT with no large PE or large
DVT , possible brewing infiltrate in LLL vs atelectasis ( poor study
due to obesity ). LENI negative.
CV: Ruled out for MI by serial markers and EKGs. ECHO 10/3 multiple
areas of HK , EF 45% ( compared to 55%
on revious echo 8/24 ) , same MR ( mild/mod ) and trace TR. A cardiac PET
scan with dobutamine ( due to asthma ) on 3/2 showed mod sized area of
prior MI in OM/PDA territory ( consistent with area of old infarct ).
--Pump: JVP up: started lasix iv with goal negative 1L per day. W
e diuresed the patient and resumed her home meds ( we switched
diovan to 80 bid , from 160 qd on discharge ).
--FEN: diuresis. Follow lytes and volume status
--CODE: DNR/DNI during this admission per her discussion with our
team and with her PCP ( addressed during outpatient appointment ).
--GI: we continued the pt on a PPI
She was discharged home with PT and VNA.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please return to the Emergency room if you have any chest pain ,
shortness of breath or faint. Please follow up with Dr. Lloyd on
discharge.

developed this shortness of breath while driving which he is
believed is secondary to an asthma flare. He received Albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers in the emergency room , as well as IV
Solu-Medrol for oxygen saturation in the 80s , with some
improvement. He was also noted to have an elevated triponin level
at 0.12. The CK was 241 with MB of 0. Subsequent CK was 393 with
MB of 50.1. He was transferred to the cardiology service for rule
out myocardial infarction and for further evaluation and treatment.
At that time he denied any chest pain or radiation of pain.

crackles , as well as wheezes , throughout. Heart: Regular rate and
rhythm. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Large , obese.
Tympanitic. Good bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits. Serum
glucose 269. CBC: WBC 12 , hematocrit 49 ,
platelet count 261.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction and he , indeed , was found to rule in
for a myocardial infarction with triponin of 7.77. He had an
echocardiogram which revealed inferior septal hypokinesis , left
ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 40%. He had normal
PA systolic pressures. He underwent cardiac catheterization on
7/1/98 which revealed stenosis of the left anterior descending
artery of 90% and left circumflex artery of 90% and right coronary
artery total occlusion. It also showed ejection fraction of 25%.
Based on these catheterization results and his ruling in for
myocardial infarction , he was taken to the operating room on
4/8/98 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft.
The left internal mammary artery was grafted to the left anterior
descending artery. The saphenous vein graft and radial artery were
used to graft the aorta to the obtuse marginal and to the posterior
descending artery. At the time of the procedure there was drainage
of a bronchogenic cyst which was identified by echocardiogram. The
contents of the cyst were found to be sterile. During the
procedure he had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed.
Postoperatively he had some bleeding from his chest tubes. The
chest was left open postoperatively and covered with Esmarch
bandage. Several hours postoperatively he had some bleeding and
required re-exploration of the chest. We removed a small amount of
bleeding from the cavity. One pack was left in.
He remained on several inatropes and pressors and remained on an
intra-aortic balloon pump. He was transfused with multiple blood
products , including platelets and fresh frozen plasma for continued
leaking. He remained intubated and was gradually weaned off of
pressors. He also remained on a Lasix drip for diuresis and he
continued to receive multiple units of blood products.
On 4/3/98 he underwent sternal closure in the operating room. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. He was again taken to
Intensive Care Unit. He remained intubated and on an intra-aortic
balloon pump. On 10/21/98 the patient had been extubated and
intra-aortic balloon pump had been removed. Gradually his cardiac
drips were weaned. Postoperatively he had atrial fibrillation and
he was begun on Coumadin. He had an atrial arrhythmia which was
controlled medically. He continued to progress slowly and was
begun on oral medications as his drips were weaned.
The patient was noted to have a 3 cm upper sternal opening which
was initially thought to be possibly infected and this was opened
as concern for his diabetes mellitus and possible infection.
Plastic surgery was consulted and there was no gross infection to
be found. He had gram stain and culture obtained of the wound.
The gram stain revealed sterile wound and culture had grown out
nothing. The plastic surgery recommended two week course of IV
Vancomycin to cover possible organisms; however , there was no
clinical evidence of infection. The patient had a PICC line placed
for long term antibiotics and he is being discharged on Vancomycin
IV at a dose of 1 mg IV q18h with peak and trough to be checked at
rehabilitation facility. He will also continue with wet to dry
dressing changes on the sternal wound t.i.d.

Discharge Date: 1/28/1994
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. UNSTABLE ANGINA
3. HYPERTENSION
4. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
5. STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY
BYPASS GRAFT
PROCEDURES: CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION AND PTCA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old male
status post coronary artery bypass
graft in 1988 who presents with unstable angina. In 9/5 , he had
an episode of substernal chest pain and an EKG done was positive.
Catheterization revealed 95% mid LAD , 50% diagonal LAD , 80% D1 , 80%
left circ , 80% OM1 , OM2 , and diffuse RCA. Attempted PTCA was
complicated by substernal chest pain and a CK peaked to 1920. He
required an intra-aortic balloon pump and emergent coronary artery
bypass graft times three. The coronary artery bypass graft
included SVG to LAG , SVG to OM1 , SVG to OM2. In 1990 , he underwent
another exercise test with one millimeter ST depression thought
secondary to fatigue. In 2/16 , he had further substernal chest
pain and shortness of breath and another positive ETT. He ruled
out for myocardial infarction at that time. Catheterization
revealed SPT to LAD patent , SPT to OM1 patent , SPT to OM2 patent.
Leading LAD , OM1 , OM2 , and OM3 100% acquitted. RC s OM3 80% , 80% ,
80% lesions were PTCA&apos;d and reduced to 20% , 20% , and 30% serial
lesions.
In October of 1994 , an exercise tolerance test was predictive of
ischemia ( exercise 9 minutes on standard Bruce with typical
substernal chest pain ). His heart rate was 131 , blood pressure
230/90 , 1 millimeter ST depression. In September of 1994 , he was
admitted with recurrent substernal chest pain which was relieved
with sublingual Nitroglycerin. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction. A catheterization at that time revealed restenosis of
proximal RCA 90% lesion. He underwent successful PTCA of RCA
lesion. Other grafts were patent. On July , 1994 , he
exercised on standard Bruce protocol six minutes and 20 seconds
with chest pain five out of ten. He had two depressions
infralaterally and was seen at CIMMC with question of restenosis. It
was felt they should increase his Diltiazem. He was intolerant of a
beta blocker. He now presents with one week of additional
substernal chest pain. On the night prior to admission , he had
substernal chest pain at rest times two which were immediately
relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for
evaluation of unstable angina with a
markedly positive exercise tolerance test at RKO for cardiac
catheterization. He ruled out for myocardial infarction with CPKs
of 158 , 143 , 132. EKGs were without any significant change and he
had no further episodes of chest burning or discomfort on the day
following admission. DIET: He was continued on his his
medications prior to admission and was also started on an ADA diet
given his diabetes. On 6/23/94 , the patient had an episode of
chest pain which required sublingual Nitroglycerin and IV Heparin
for resolution. He described this as chest pressure radiating
bilaterally to his neck and complained of gas like sensations.
EKGs revealed ST change in 1 and inverted T in AVL and he was
started on IV Heparin. He was also given Serax. IV TNG was
started and titrated to obtain a blood pressure greater than 100.
His symptoms resolved. An EKG following a resolution of symptoms
showed resolution of EKG changes. Duration of chest pain was
approximately 40 minutes. A cardiac catheterization on 10/17/94
showed preliminary results of 80% stenosis in mid RCA which was
successfully dilated to 20% with PTCA , an occluded LAD , an occluded

Discharge Date: 5/6/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ASTHMA EXACERBATION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1 ) MORBID OBESITY.
2 ) HISTORY OF RECURRENT DEEP VENOUS
THROMBOSES/PULMONARY EMBOLUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 47 year-old woman
with a long-standing history of asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who now presents with
cough , shortness of breath , increased wheezing times three days.
The patient is a morbidly obese woman with a long-standing history
of asthma since childhood. Her most recent pulmonary function
tests in October of 1998 revealed an FVC of 2.6 and FEV1 of 1.43
and an FEV1/FVC of 66%. Her most recent hospitalization for an
asthma exacerbation was October of 2000 at the Joh Memorial Hospital She has no history of intubations , no medical intensive
care unit admissions , no home oxygen. She also has a history of
repeated deep venous thromboses , particularly to the left lower
extremity and a history of pulmonary embolus in 1975 and 1991. She
has been on Coumadin since 1991 with her last admission for a deep
venous thrombosis in 1997. Three days prior to this admission , the
patient noted that she felt unwell with a cough productive of
yellow sputum , increased shortness of breath and wheezing. She
attributed the cough and wheeze to exposure to dust and mold on
Monday at the nursing facility at which she lives. The patient was
diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection at the skilled
nursing facility at which resides and she received one dose of
Doxycycline 100 mg on the night prior to admission. She was
transferred to the Linverl Health Services on August , 2000 for
increased shortness of breath , cough and wheezing , not relieved by
two Ventolin nebulizers. She notes no associated symptoms , no sore
throat , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , fever or hemoptysis. She has
been afebrile with no known ill contacts. In the emergency room ,
she had a peak flow of 180 with a normal peak flow of 350. In the
emergency department , she received an Albuterol nebulizer , Atrovent
nebulizer times one , Levofloxacin 500 mg times one , Prednisone 60
mg times one and was admitted for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) As above with a history of asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She
was admitted for pneumonia in 1997. 2 ) Deep venous thromboses
which have been recurrent since age 21 with left lower extremity

660 mcg p.o. b.i.d. 19 ) Serevent 20 mcg inhaled 2 puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to horse serum which leads to
anaphylaxis.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father had a cerebrovascular accident at age 35 ,
history of arterial thromboses. Mother has breast
cancer. Both parents are still living.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a nursing home separated from
her husband. She smokes three to four cigarettes
a day which is down from one pack per day. No significant alcohol
history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was a
morbidly obese woman breathing with
difficulty lying in bed. Her vital signs included a temperature of
98.5 degrees , heart rate 98 , blood pressure 110/80 with a
respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Her
physical examination was significant for the following: Her skin
had no rashes , no cyanosis. She was normocephalic , atraumatic with
no nasal discharge , no sinus tenderness , moist , pink , mucous
membranes with no exudate or erythema. Her neck was supple and
non-tender with no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distension
and no thyromegaly. Her chest examination revealed diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes bilaterally with a prolonged
expiratory phase , no crackles or rales. Her diaphragm elevated
symmetrically on expiration. Cardiac examination was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs.
Her abdomen was soft , obese , non-tender with positive bowel sounds ,
no masses were palpated. Her examination was limited secondary to
obesity. Her extremities were warm with no clubbing or cyanosis.
She had marked edema of the lower extremities bilaterally with left
greater than right. Dorsalis pedis pulses were trace bilaterally.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were notable a white blood cell
count of 11.3 , hematocrit 36.7 and platelet count 317.
PT was elevated at 23.5 , PTT 42.2 , INR 3.8. Electrolytes included
a sodium of 141 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN
17 , creatinine 0.9 and a glucose of 108. Calcium was 9.6 ,
magnesium 1.9. Theophylline level was 14.7. Her EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm with 95 beats per minute. PR , QRS and QTC intervals
were all within normal limits. Her chest x-ray , PA and lateral ,
showed low lung volumes but no pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Respiratory: The patient&apos;s symptoms were
most likely secondary to asthma in the setting of
bronchitis given her long-standing history of asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and her recent exposure to mold and
dust. A pulmonary embolus was deemed less likely given her INR of
3.8 and her oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. She was started
on Prednisone 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. and her medical regimen included
Uniphyl 800 mg b.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Albuterol
nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and q.1h. p.r.n. , Flovent 660 mcg b.i.d. ,
Flonase 1-2 sprays q. day , Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d. and Atrovent
nebulizers q.i.d. The patient was also placed on Levofloxacin 500
mg q. day for her infection. The patient remains afebrile
throughout her course. Her sputum culture grew out 4+ polys ,
moderate gram , positive variable cocci in clusters and few gram
negative rods. The patient continued to improve on her medical
regimen with continued cough and sputum production. She was placed
on two liters oxygen nasal cannula on August , 2000 overnight for
comfort. Her peak flow was less than 120 on admission and improved
to 240 on May , 2000 , 230 on October , 2000 and peak flow of 320 on
May , 2000. The patient remained short of breath although this
improved over her course and she also improved in movement with
diminished wheezing. On discharge , the patient had a peak flow of
320 , saturating 97% on room air with a respiratory rate of 20. The
patient was discharged today to her nursing home , continuing on her
nebulizers and inhalers as well as the Prednisone 60 mg t.i.d.
today , day five and then continuing a slow taper thereafter with 50
mg t.i.d. times five days , then 40 mg t.i.d. times five days , 30 mg
t.i.d. times five days , 20 mg t.i.d. times five days and 10 mg
t.i.d. times five days.
2 ) Infectious disease: The patient is on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q. day. Today is day number five and she will complete a seven day
course of Levofloxacin at her nursing home.
3 ) Hematology: The patient had an INR of 3.8 on 9 mg b.i.d. of
Coumadin upon admission. In the past , she has been known to have
an increased INR with the addition of antibiotics due to decreased
Coumadin clearance. Thus , on admission , we decreased her Coumadin
dose to 8 mg b.i.d. However , on January , 2000 , her INR climbed to
5.0 , so we again reduced her Coumadin to 6 mg b.i.d. Her evening
dose of Coumadin was held as well. The patient&apos;s INR was noted to
be 2.0 on October , 2000 and the Coumadin dose was again raised to 9
mg b.i.d. On May , 2000 , the patient&apos;s INR was 4.5. The
patient&apos;s AM dose of Coumadin was ordered to be held and her
Coumadin dose was readjusted to 7 mg in the AM and 8 mg in the PM
while on the antibiotics. She was ordered for two more days of
Levofloxacin and then two days after she stopped the Levofloxacin ,
INR should be rechecked and Coumadin dose readjusted to 9 mg b.i.d.
with INR being checked every day.
4 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient continued on
her weight reduction medications including Xenical 120 mg b.i.d.
and Adipex 30 mg q. day. The Phentermine was discontinued to be
restarted at the nursing home. The patient&apos;s weight was noted to
be 395.2 pounds.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Josef Chandley is a
71-year-old white female who underwent cardiac transplantation on
1/27/1992. She has had a variety of important posttransplant
medical issues including diabetes , obesity , and spinal stenosis.
She has also had significant vascular disease including allograft
coronary artery disease and bilateral carotid artery disease. She
underwent stenting of the right internal carotid artery in
9/6 and stenting of the left internal carotid artery in 5/2
In addition , in 9/6 , she underwent stenting of the left
circumflex coronary artery and in 2/20 , she underwent stenting of
the left anterior descending coronary artery. At the time of her
catheterization in July , it was noted that she had additional
disease in the left circumflex and the posterior descending coronary
artery and the decision was made to perform an additional procedure
for some or all of these lesions. The patient now returns for repeat
intervention in the left circumflex PCI Notes---
Complicated bifurcation lesion of mLCX involving OM1 and OM2.
Bifurcation ultimately treated with &quot;coulotte&quot; stenting with 2.5( 28 )
Cypher in lower branch and 2.5( 18 ) Cypher in upper branch. Kissing
balloon inflations performed at the end of the procedure. There was
a dissection in the mid portion of the lower OM at the end of the
case. Likely due to coronary guidewire that had to be
placed in a tortous vessel. Given distal nature of dissection , we
elected not to treat further at this time. Patient tolerated
procedure well without complaints.
Started integrilin at the end of the case for 18 hours.
She should remain on aspirin for life and clopidogrel indefinitely.
She will have her CK&apos;s checked as well as Cr. in AM.
SSI coverage. Mucomyst and
IVF Manual 8Fr sheath removed from Rt
CFA.

Pt did well overnight. groin stable without hematoma , bruit. denies any
groin/flank pain. bp stable. ck&apos;s flat. hct noted to be decreased to 26
from 32- likely related to prlonged procedure. will repeat to make ure
stable prior to d/c.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: -you must take aspirin for life
-you must take plavix for a minimum of 1 year
DO NOT STOP ASPIRIN OR PLAVIX FOR ANY REASON UNLESS SPEAK WITH YOUR
CARDIOLOGIST!

tubes were placed.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:
The patient was transferred in stable condition to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit. While on the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ,
her course was complicated by the following:
1. Initially felt that she had ST inferior lead changes. It has
turned out to be artifactual.
2. She has pericardial changes that resolved approximately 2
days after the operation.
She was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #2. While on the Cardiac Step-Down Unit ,
course was complicated by the following:
1. Initially the cardiac surgical team had trouble diuresing Ms.
Kaiserman She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix until she was
approximately 500 mL to 1000 mL negative per day. She was
eventually converted to p.o. Lasix and will be discharged on p.o.
Lasix. She was weaned from her oxygen requirement and there are
no gross effusions on her chest x-ray at the time of discharge.
2. On the day prior to discharge , physical therapist felt that
Ms. Dortilla would benefit from rehabilitation stay as she was
unsteady in her gait on the stairs. However , Ms. Bantug will
only have to climb approximately 2-4 stairs to get into her home
and her bedroom as well as bathroom will be on the first four.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA POST EXERCISE
TOLERANCE TEST RECOVERY.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1 ) HYPERCOAGULABILITY STATE WITH NEGATIVE SERUM WORK-UP.
2 ) RULE OUT RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ON THE LEFT ( CT PENDING ).
3 ) HISTORY OF PPD POSITIVITY WITH CHEST X-RAY NEGATIVE.
4 ) GOUT.
5 ) CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE STATUS POST UNILATERAL

6 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS A.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year old man with
coronary risk factors of hypertension ,
borderline hypercholesterolemia , remote tobacco with a history of
hypercoagulability ( negative work-up for protein C , S , activated
protein C , factor V lydin , antithrombin III , anticardiolipin
antibody , and homocystine level ) , and multiple deep venous
thromboses/pulmonary emboli requiring chronic anticoagulation and
placement of an IVC filter in 11/20 He reportedly had a history
of chronic shortness of breath and negative stress test for
ischemia in 6/10 through 3/11/98. A Holter monitor in 4/17
showed frequent premature ventricular contractions , 21 couplets ,
and no other arrhythmias. An echo in 10/28 showed an ejection
fraction of 55% , left ventricular hypertrophy , mitral valve
prolapse with 2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and trace aortic
insufficiency. A repeat Holter in 3/15 showed numerous premature
ventricular contractions , PM bradycardia , sinus tachycardia , a rate
of 113 , six triplets , and 172 couplets. On a stress test in 4/4 ,
the patient lasted two minutes and stopped secondary to atypical
chest pain with a peak heart rate of 79% of predicted and a peak
blood pressure of 170. There were no signs of definite ischemic
and no clinically significant rhythm disturbance. The patient
reported a vague history of arrhythmia in the Oven
for which he was supposedly due to have a pacemaker placed. He
denied ever being symptomatic with these arrhythmias. Over the
last week , he had reported increasing fatigue and shortness of
breath. The day of admission on his way to the clinic for an INR
check , he reported chest tightness that was different from his
previous pulmonary emboli , apparently 10/10 on presentation though
he denied it after the fact associated with shortness of breath and
fatigue with &quot;heavy heart beats&quot;. He denied associated symptoms of
nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , light headedness , and palpitations.
He denied congestive heart failure and syncopal symptoms over the
last few weeks. In the Emergency Room , he had flat CK and a 0
troponin I and a stress test lasting three minutes and fifteen
seconds. Patient stopped secondary to fatigue and not chest pain ,
however , three to five minutes after recovery , he developed a
couple of episodes of nonmonomorphic wide complex tachycardia at a
rate of about 150 lasting twenty to thirty beats during which time
he was reportedly asymptomatic. The patient was admitted for
evaluation of this possible ventricular tachycardia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of multiple pulmonary emboli/deep
venous thromboses with number one in 11/17 ,
status post TPA when echo showed right ventricular strain , number
two in 6/28 , number three in 6/10 after one year of Coumadin , and
number four in 2/11 status post IVC filter placement when patient
bled into left renal cyst with goal INR of 3 to 3.8. Patient had a
negative hypercoagulability work-up , question of renal cell
carcinoma which must be evaluated in the next two months , history
of PPD positivity of 2 cm and negative chest x-ray , mitral valve
prolapse and MR on echo , hypertensive borderline
hypercholesterolemia , gout , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
status post unilateral orchiectomy , restrictive lung disease ,
history of a duplex 5 cm adrenal mass , negative 17
hydroxyketosteroids and VMA , and history of hepatitis A virus.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg
p.o. q.d. , Cardura 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Axid 150
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.d. , and indomethacin q.4h.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies
( hydrochlorothiazide was thought to cause gout
exacerbations and ace inhibitor thought to cause cough , and beta
blocker with urinary retention ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Patient had a family history of cancer and no
history of premature coronary disease ,
palpitations , or sudden death.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient immigrated from the Georgia
with his wife a few years ago , had a remote
history of tobacco , occasional alcohol , and no drugs. He was a
previous factory worker.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 70 year old with a history of
hypertensive borderline hypercholesterolemia , and
hypercoagulability with multiple pulmonary emboli in the past who
presented asymptomatically with a wide complex tachycardia that
could not rule out ventricular tachycardia in the recovery phase of
a full Bruce exercise tolerance test. The patient was admitted for
Holter monitoring times 48 hours. He was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction. He was started on a cholesterol lowering
agent , his Coumadin was held , and Heparin was started in the case
of an invasive procedure. On 10/15/98 , the patient had an exercise
tolerance test MIBI on an increased dose of beta blocker of 50 mg
of Lopressor q.8h. which showed that the patient exercised three
minutes and fifteen seconds stopping secondary to leg pain from his
deep venous thrombosis with a peak heart rate of 106 , peak blood
pressure 150/80 , frequent premature ventricular contractions in
couplets , no ST or T wave changes , and no chest pain. The patient
then had an adenosine MIBI with a maximum heart rate of 81 and a
maximum blood pressure of 180/70. He did have chest pain after the
infusion with T wave inversions in V5 through V6 and occasional
premature ventricular contractions that were consistent with but
not diagnostic of ischemia. The MIBI images showed mild
nonspecific inferior wall changes with some reversibility
suggestive with but not conclusive of ischemia. The patient was
discharged the following day on his usual out-patient medicines
with the addition of an ace inhibitor , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. ,
given his mitral regurgitation. He will continue his beta blocker
at an increased dose , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , in addition to his
Cardura and amlodipine. He was started on Zocor at 10 mg p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: He will need out-patient echos to follow his mitral
regurgitation and will need to be observed the higher
risk of developing atrial fibrillation. He will also need a repeat
stress test in the next couple of months when his leg pain
completely resolves. From a hypercoagulability standpoint , his
Coumadin was started at his usual out-patient dose of 6 mg p.o.
q.p.m. with enoxaparin used as a bridge to anticoagulation until
his INR is at least 3. His goal INR is between 3 and 3.8. He will
have visiting nurse teach him to use the enoxaparin and will come
to Coumadin Clinic at SHAVA HEALTHCARE every two to three days to have his INR
level checked. A pelvic CT was scheduled on 8/14/98 at 2 p.m. to
reevaluate his kidneys and rule out renal cell carcinoma.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg
p.o. q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cardura 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. , nitroglycerin
sublingual tablets 0.4 mg q.5 minutes p.r.n. chest pain ,
indomethacin 25 mg p.o. q.6h. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h. until INR 3 ,
and Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.p.m.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Darnell Wanca
next week and was in stable condition upon discharge.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: A 29-year-old G 3 P 2 admitted on postoperative
day #19 , status post a STAT cesarean section at
29 weeks for fetal bradycardia following laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. She was readmitted for wound infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient&apos;s past medical history
is significant for cardiac transplant
in 1989 for a dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient is on multiple
immunosuppressants. The patient had several episodes of acute
cholecystitis and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy nineteen
days prior to admission. Fetal bradycardia developed immediately
following the cholecystectomy and a STAT cesarean section was
performed. The patient was returned to the Cardiology Service for
further management of fluid status and mild congestive heart failure.
She was discharged on postoperative day #7. On 3/3 the patient
was seen in the MFM practice and a wound hematoma on the left side was
noted. It was and drained with normal , healthy tissue identified.
She had b.i.d. dressing changes with a visiting nurse. On the day of
admission the patient noted a temperature to 100.0 , slightly foul-smelling
discharge from the wound. She denied abdominal pain. The patient
also noted that the right foot pain present at the time of surgery
had been worsening over the course of the day and was noted to be
swollen and erythematous at the time of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Viral cardiomyopathy , now status post
transplant , hypertension , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.8 ,
hyperlipidemia , obesity , history of group A Strep sepsis in 1998.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cesarean section x 2 in 1998 and 2001 ,
laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 10/24 ,
D&amp;E for SAb in 11 of November , status post eye surgery in 1973.
MEDICATIONS: Imuran 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.; cyclosporin 125 mg p.o.
q.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.; pravastatin 10 mg
p.o. q. h.s.; quinidine sulfate 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Kaopectate 30
mg p.o. q. i.d.; Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.; miconazole topical 2%
p.r.n.; Tylenol #3 1-2 p.o. q. 4-6h p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , penicillin , IVP dye all cause pink rash ,
succinylcholine resulted in respiratory arrest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 ,
blood pressure 120/60 ,
respirations 18 , pulse 74. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
nontender , nondistended , incision was open at two sites. There was
gray , malodorous fluid draining from the wound. The wound tracked
superiorly on the left. The fascia was intact. There was no
evidence of necrotic tissue. EXTREMITIES: Distal extremities had
trace edema , right greater than left with erythema and tenderness
on the dorsal surface of the right ankle.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Wound infection: An Infectious Disease
consult was obtained at the time of admission and
the patient was sent for immediate intraoperative treatment and
wound debridement. Surgery was consulted intraoperatively to
confirm healthy tissue and no evidence of necrosis. The patient
was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin IV and t.i.d. dressing
changes. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic therapy were
negative for bacteremia. Cultures of the wound were consistent
with Strep and diphtheroids with obvious polymicrobial involvement.
On hospital day #3 blood cultures which had been drawn from the
patient&apos;s indwelling line returned with 2/4 bottles positive for
gram-positive cocci in clusters. The central line was discontinued.
The patient began treatment on vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 12h , levofloxacin
was continued and the Flagyl was started 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. The
patient remained afebrile throughout this time. A CT of the abdomen
and pelvis was obtained per Infectious Disease recommendation and it
confirmed that there was no intraabdominal abscess. The patient was
continued on IV vancomycin with p.o. Flagyl and levofloxacin until
4/14/01 , hospital day #8. At that point the patient was discharged to
home with visiting nurse and continued IV and p.o. antibiotics x 14
days. Cultures obtained following discontinuation of her central
line returned as negative. On hospital day #6 the patient had
a significant yeast infection surrounding the lower aspect of the
incision as well as in the intertriginous areas. This was treated
with topical nystatin.
2 ) Cardiovascular: The patient&apos;s cardiac standpoint remained
stable throughout the admission with no evidence of congestive
heart failure. Routine echo was performed on 5/25/01 as scheduled
per her transplant protocol. There were no other cardiovascular
issues during the patient&apos;s admission.
3 ) Renal: The patient had a baseline history of renal
insufficiency as described above with a creatinine of 2.1 on
admission. Creatinine increased during her admission to a maximum
of 3.1. She was also noted to have decreasing urine output at that
time. Adjustments were made in vancomycin and cyclosporin levels
and the patient&apos;s creatinine slowly returned to baseline with
significant improvement of urine output.
4 ) GI: The patient had no difficulties with bowel function until
hospital day #5 when patient was noting increasingly loose
stools. C. diff. was obtained x 2 and were negative. She was
treated with Imodium p.r.n.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient had initially right ankle pain and
swelling noted at the time of admission. A Rheumatology consult
was obtained and the joint was tapped and there was no evidence of
infection at that time. The patient was continued to be followed
by Rheumatology and , based on Rheumatology and Transplant Team
recommendations , was treated with colchicine for the diagnosis of
gout on immunosuppressant medications. The possibility of plantar
fasciitis was raised during admission and treatment was pain
medication , continued colchicine and physical therapy. The patient
was able to ambulate at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin 750 mg IV q. 12h; levofloxacin
500 mg p.o. q.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
x 14 days; Percocet 1-2 p.o. q. 3-4h p.r.n. pain.
The patient had a visiting nurse established for continued b.i.d.
dressing changes at home and to obtain vancomycin and cyclosporin
levels as needed.
FOLLOWUP: She will be followed by her cardiac transplant team to
follow her antibiotic and immunosuppressant levels. She
was scheduled for routine follow up with the cardiac transplant
team with no changes in appointment time , follow up with OB/GYN in
two weeks&apos; time.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was admitted for an elective right heart
catheterization and reassessment of refractory CHF and atrial fibrillation He
is a 62-year-old man with
a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30% who was diagnosed
about ten years ago and has been stable with medical management
until this past year when he started developing worsening dyspnea
on exertion , orthopnea , palpitations , and PND. His functional
status has declined significantly since then. In 11/26 , he was
admitted for decompensated heart failure and diuresed back to dry
weight. An ICD was placed at that time. Following discharge , he
developed AFib with rapid ventricular response and underwent DC
cardioversion with Dr. Gerry Canseco however , relapsed shortly ,
thereafter. He was started on amiodarone , but developed a
question of pulmonary toxicity with significant dry coughing. He
was continued to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response despite maximal carvedilol and digoxin. He is now being
electively admitted for right heart catheterization , diuresis ,
and possible repeat cardioversion versus amiodarone challenge ,
and completion of his transplant evaluation.

in no distress. His JVP was approximately 12 cm. He had a right
ventricular heave. His rate was irregularly irregular with an
S3 , no murmurs. Chest is clear to auscultation. He had a
palpable pulsatile liver tip , but otherwise , his abdomen was
benign. He had no lower extremity edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
He is a 62-year-old man with nonischemic cardiomyopathy , EF 30% ,
awaiting transplant who is now admitted for right heart
catheterization and diuresis for volume overload and possible
amiodarone challenge versus cardioversion , rate and rhythm
control atrial fibrillation.
Cardiovascular: The patient had no evidence of ischemia. He was
mildly volume overloaded and was gently diuresed with p.o. Lasix
and eventually b.i.d. p.o. torsemide at 60 mg b.i.d. He was
diuresed onto his dry weight of 70 kilograms. He underwent
exercise stress testing and was able to go for 7 minutes without
any ischemic changes. His rhythm rate was in atrial fibrillation
throughout. He has peak oxygen uptake with above is anaerobic
threshold and his peak respiratory exchange ratio was 1.44. He
underwent a chest CT , which showed no evidence of amiodarone
pneumonitis or interstitial disease , and then was subsequently
started on amiodarone challenge in attempts to rhythm and rate
control of atrial fibrillation. He was resistant to the
amiodarone in terms of rate and rhythm control; however , began
developing elevated LFTs consistent with amiodarone hepatitis as
well as a persistent dry cough concerning for amiodarone
pulmonary toxicity. The amiodarone was stopped and he was
started on dofetilide at 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. for correcting for
his creatinine clearance. After 2 doses of dofetilide , he
converted to normal sinus rhythm and was rate controlled in the
70s and 80s. His QTc was followed twice a day and did not show
any signs of prolongation. He was finally being discharged on
dofetilide for rate and rhythm control as he is now in normal
sinus rhythm. He will also go home on torsemide 60 mg p.o.
b.i.d. to maintain his dry weight. He has been instructed to
continue taking his glyburide , but not his metformin given his
poor creatinine clearance being discharged with a creatinine of
1.6 and the fact that he is on metformin. He will see his
primary care doctor and will either likely be started on low-dose
insulin or another oral hypoglycemic agent. He will follow up
with his primary care doctor and Dr. Rosasco for continued
transplant evaluation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Include carvedilol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , darbepoetin 100 mcg
subcutaneous q. week , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. every other day ,
dofetilide 125 mcg p.o. b.i.d. , Vytorin one tab p.o. daily , iron
sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , potassium
40 mEq p.o. daily , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Protonix 40 mg
p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
q.p.m.
FINAL ADDENDUM:
The patient will continue taking his Coumadin for goal INR of 2-3
and follow up at the Vent Buffbo Medical Center Coumadin Clinic , in addition , he
received one unit of packed red blood cells for anemia of chronic
disease and was given IV iron therapy and will continue the
patient on oral iron replacement.

Discharge Date: 11/28/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Waycaster is a 70-year-old
gentleman who went to see primary care
physician and presented with aphasia. MRI was sent at that time ,
which revealed a left parietal infarct. A transesophageal
echocardiogram was done , which revealed a large left atrial myxoma
with prolapse across the mitral valve into the left ventricle with
a pedunculated stock. The patient does not have symptomatic heart
failure and is normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for percutaneous
transluminal coronary angiography
and atherectomy with stent placement , history of recent
cerebrovascular accident , diabetes mellitus , oral agent treatment ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , remote history of gout ,
chronic renal insufficiency , status post angioplasty and stenting
procedures , and anemia. He is status post a right nephrectomy in
1999 , with renal cell carcinoma and right knee replacement in 2001 ,
and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the year 2001. The patient
underwent cardiac catheterization on 4/26/02 , which revealed a
left anterior descending coronary artery with a 40% stenosis , first
obtuse marginal coronary artery with a 60% stenosis , a right
coronary artery with a 60% stenosis and a right dominant
circulation , ejection fraction of 50%. The patient underwent an
echocardiogram on 1/9/02 which revealed the following: ( 1 ) Left
ventricular cavity size with wall thickness and systolic function
appeared normal with an ejection fraction of 55% , with no akinetic
areas seen. ( 2 ) The right ventricle appears normal in size and
systolic function. ( 3 ) The aortic valve is trileaflet without
evidence of dysfunction. ( 4 ) The mitral leaflets appear mildly
thickened. There is light retrace mitral regurgitation. The left
atrium is enlarged. ( 5 ) A large heterogeneous multilobulated mass
is seen within the atrium. It appears to be attached by a stalk to
the interatrial septum. The mass measures approximately 7 x 3.5 cm
and prolapses to the mitral valve and to the left ventricle. The
distal portion of this mass has more mobile element. A mild amount
of inflow obstruction is noted , and there is also mild valvular
incompetence. The appearance of the mass is most consistent with
myxoma , although other primary and secondary neoplasms are also
possible. Thrombus is seen much likely , but superimposed thrombus
formation overlying the main mass is possible. ( 6 ) The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trace tricuspid
regurgitation with peak velocity of 2.7 m/sec predicting pulmonary
artery systolic pressures of 29 mmHg plus right atrial pressure.
( 7 ) There is no evident pericardial effusion. ( 8 ) No prior studies
are available for comparison. ( 9 ) Findings reviewed with clinical
team. The patient also underwent a MRI of the brain which revealed
the following: ( 1 ) Left parietal infarct. ( 2 ) Bilateral posterior
communicating arteries. Otherwise , normal vasculature. The
patient was seen by the neurology service who recommended that the
patient did not proceed with his cardiac surgery at this time. He
will be discharged to home and be readmitted on 2/19/02 in the
year 2002 for his cardiac surgery. He has otherwise had an
uneventful hospital course and will be discharged to home in stable
condition.

STUDIES:
Cardiac MRI , 4/25/2005 , revealed scar tissue in the
mid-to-distal LAD region.
Left heart catheterization , 7/15/2005 , revealed severe
three-vessel disease with 50% to 60% stenosis of LM , 95% stenosis
of LAD , a tight calcified RCA and OM1.
Cardiac echo , 7/15/2005 , ejection fraction of 35% to 40% , septal

Stress MIBI with PET viability , 6/15/2005 , revealed viable
myocardium.
PROCEDURES: Carotid duplex study , 6/15/2005 : Showed no
significant disease of the carotid arteries.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia-The patient had a stable anginal
pattern , but had new Q waves in the anterior leads and a troponin
leak. She was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction and continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and initially
on heparin drip. The cardiac catheterization showed severe
three-vessel disease and a question of viable myocardium. A
stress MIBI with PET viability on 6/15/2005 showed viable
myocardium; however , cardiac MRI with gadolinium showed scarred
tissue in the LAD territory. A CT Surgery consult was obtained
to consider CABG versus PCI. After reviewing the radiology
studies , it was determined that the patient would benefit from a
CABG. She was on a schedule to have CABG during this admission;
however , due to scheduling constraints , will be discharged home
and then return to the hospital , 11/5/2005 , for CABG to be
performed by Dr. Kernan Her cardiac enzymes trended down during
the admission. She will be discharged with a prescription for
nitroglycerin sublingually as needed for chest pain and
instructed to call her physician/911 , if she experiences any
chest pain. Pump - an echocardiogram on 7/15/2005 revealed an
ejection fraction of 35% to 40%. The patient was euvolemic on
her exam. She continued on her lisinopril , Imdur , Lopressor
while in-house.
2. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
The patient&apos;s oral hypoglycemic medications were held during the
admission and she was given standing NPH insulin , standing
prandial NovoLog with scale coverage. She will be discharged
home on her glyburide and Avandia. Her metformin will be held
given her increased creatinine upon admission.
3. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of 1.4 on admission.
Her fractional excretion of sodium was calculated to be 0.45% ,
and she was thought to be prerenal. Prior to discharge , her
creatinine normalized to 1.1.
4. FEN: The patient tolerated a low-sodium , no-caffeine diet.
5. Psychiatry: The patient continued on her amitriptyline for a
history of depression.
6. Medication changes: The patient will not continue on her
Norvasc and metformin. She will continue on her aspirin ,
lisinopril , hydrochlorothiazide , allopurinol , Fosamax ,
multivitamin , and amitriptyline. She will start on Imdur ,
high-dose Lipitor and Avandia. Her glyburide was changed to
once-a-day dosing , and her atenolol was changed to Toprol-XL 75
mg p.o. once a day.
TO DO/PLAN: The patient was instructed to return to the hospital
if she experienced any chest pain , shortness of breath , worsening
leg swelling , nausea , vomiting , sweating or fevers. The patient
will return to the hospital on 11/5/2005 for CABG with Dr.
Moton She is also scheduled for a followup appointment with
Dr. Talamantez , 030-710-3626 on 7/7/2005 at 4:40 p.m. The patient
was instructed to return to the hospital two hours before her
scheduled surgery on 9/5/2005.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary: Maintained on BiPAP and nasal canula with sats and
the ABG improving on transfer from MICU. On 10/11/2003 , ABG at
the time showed , was 7.31/74/71 , consistent with chronic
hypercarbia. Given the asymmetric leg swelling , PE and DVT was
suspected , however , unable to obtain further imaging due to
patient&apos;s size. D-dimer greater than 4000 , empirically
anticoagulated with Lovenox. Ten-A levels were supratherapeutic
initially trending down. PICC line placed in order to obtain
more regular Ten-A levels but then had to be removed ( see below ).
Given patient&apos;s size and risk for DVT , patient sent to rehab on
Lovenox.
2. CV-Ischemia: The patient had a troponin bump to 1.09 on third
set of enzymes without EKG changes. Thought to be secondary to
pulmonary disease , ? right heart strain in setting of PE.
Troponin trending down on second assay. Aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin continued.
Pump: Echo showed an EF of 65% with moderate right ventricular
stain consistent with prior echo and pulmonary hypertension ,
evidence of fluid overload , patient diuresed on IV Lasix with
good improvement.
Rhythm: No active issues.
3. Heme: Anticoagulated empirically for presumed DVT/PE on
Lovenox. Hematocrit stable.
4. Infectious Disease: UA was 4+ bacteria initially on
levofloxacin , Foley removed 8/29/2003.
5. Endocrine: Initially maintained on insulin drip in MICU ,
transported to floor and maintained on NPH/RISS. Blood sugars
remained 150s-250s on stable NPH regimen.
6. Renal: 10/19/2003 with high bicarb , 37 , in setting of heavy
diuresis , suspect contraction alkalosis. Spironolactone added to
regimen with good effect.
7. Pain: Patient has chronic pain medications , left on home
doses of Vicodin , and diazepam and Percocet.
8. Access: PICC line placed 10/11/2003 for lab access , unable to
get reliable access , but arm swelling on 6/2/2003 , removed PICC
line , patient started on Keflex , 5-day course , for
thrombophlebitis , question cellulitis , suspected in setting of
left arm swelling greater than right and tenderness.

Discharge Date: 6/11/1995
PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old
white male status post anterior wall
myocardial infarction , status post TPA who presented with
post-infarct angina and three-vessel disease by catheterization.
The patient&apos;s cardiac risk factors include diabetes , hypertension ,
and positive family history. The patient denies cigarettes. The
patient is a very noncooperative historian.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history is
significant for diabetes of 20 years
without neurological or retinopathy treated with oral
hypoglycemics. The patient has long-standing hypotension of 30 to
40 years. The patient , in 1985 , had a percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty at the Ribush Bassta Syark Hospital and has
had rule outs since for myocardial infarction with the last one
approximately in 1990 at Dormro General Hospital . The
patient , however , has been able to work and climb stairs and walk
about a mile without difficulty. Several days to admission , the
patient reports pain and ache over the lower back and flanks as
well as substernal chest pain with radiation to the upper left arm.
The patient is unable to describe any further symptoms. The
patient denied nausea or vomiting but says he was diaphoretic. The
patient took four to five Nitroglycerins without relief. The
patient subsequently was admitted to Agrit Medical Center and had at
least 3 hours of pain at Pari . The patient was ruled
in for anterior wall myocardial infarction with ST elevations 4 to
5 mm in V1. Blood pressure was 152/95. The patient received
front-loaded TPA , Heparin , Aspirin , Morphine sulfate and
Nifedipine. At 1:00 a.m. , the patient had recurrent chest pain
with elevations in V1 through 6 , Lead , 1 , AVL and the patient was
subsequently transferred to the Pepor El Medical Center Of . At
the Hitchter University Medical Center , the patient was cathed and had
100% stenotic mid left anterior descending , 90% ulcerated obtuse
marginal first branch , 60 to 70% stenotic right coronary artery and
anterior apical aneurysm was noted. The patient was placed on an
intra-aortic balloon pump in preparation for coronary artery bypass
surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history is
inclusive of status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty in &apos;85 at Ason Medical Center , coronary artery disease , diabetes , hypertension and
ruptured appendectomy 25 years prior to admission.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The patient was admitted on the
following medications: Diltiazem 60
t.i.d. , Glyburide , Lisinopril 20 PO q.day.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug
allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the
patient&apos;s temperature is 98.1 , heart
rate 66 , sinus 137/57 , saturating at 97% and 100% face mask who is
in no acute distress lying in bed with an intra-aortic balloon
pump. HEENT: Pupils are equal and reactive to light and
accommodation. Intraocular muscles intact. Oropharynx clear.
Neck: Jugular venous pressure was about 8 cm. There was no
hepatojugular reflux. No thyromegaly. No lymphadenopathy.
Carotids were 2+ without bruits. Heart: A balloon pump was in
place. Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2. No murmurs
appreciated. Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities: No clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. The patient had 2+ dorsalis and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally and on the right femoral artery had a right
intra-aortic balloon pump in place. There were no varices noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient went to the Operating
Room on 9/29 , had a coronary artery
bypass graft x three with a saphenous vein graft to the LAD , first
branch of the obtuse marginal and the posterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Unit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 ,
the patient self-extubated himself and resultantly had an adequate
arterial blood gas , thus not requiring emergent intubation. The
patient&apos;s intra-aortic balloon pump was subsequently removed
without further incident , and the patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor in stable condition. On postoperative day
#3 , the patient had atrial fibrillation which was treated and
controlled pharmacologically , and also the patient was treated with
prophylactic anticoagulation with Coumadin. The remainder of the
hospital stay , the patient remained afebrile , tolerated his diet ,
was ambulatory , had his chest tube and cordis and Foley catheters
removed. On postoperative day #6 , the patient converted to sinus
rhythm , and the patient had planned discharge for 24 hours after
that which would have been on 10/2 However , the patient
requested to be discharged to home. The condition was discussed
with the patient and the patient&apos;s wife which required continued
observation until the morning for removal of epicardial wires.
However , the patient refused to stay. He experienced a desire to
go home stating that he does not like the food here and is unable
to sleep and does not want further medical intervention. The risks
of the discharge including rhythm , abnormalities and complications
related to pacing wires were reviewed with the patient and his
wife.
DISPOSITION: Despite understanding potential risks
for discharge , the patient expressed
desire for leaving against medical advice. The above condition was
discussed with Dr. Poore , the attending surgeon. The patient was
subsequently found to have left the hospital by taxi with IV
Heplocks , wires and Telemetry intact. The patient was called at
home , and condition of his discharge and recommendations were given
which were to return to the hospital to have IV&apos;s , wires and
Telemetry removed. The patient refused , however. He refused to
have the Visiting Nurse Association to come in to remove his IV&apos;s.
The patient was encouraged to return for clipping of the epicardial
pacing wires; however , he refused. The patient&apos;s wife was sent
with prescriptions and risk management was also informed. The
patient was requested to return today , the 10 of October , to have
pacing wires and Telemetry removed as well as IV&apos;s. The patient
returned for an hour , had pacing wires removed and Telemetry box
also removed. The patient just left on his own accord. The
patient requested to follow-up with Dr. Schoening in 6 weeks and his
cardiologist in 2 weeks.

Discharge Date: 6/20/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: LEGIONNAIRES&apos; DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43 year old woman
with no significant past medical
history who presented with fevers , chills , sweats , shortness of
breath , pleuritic chest pain , cough inducing vomiting of white to
yellow fluid , myalgias , burning epigastric pain , and diarrhea all
over the last five days. The source was the patient via Spanish
interpreter , the patient was a poor historian , and her old chart
was missing at the time of admission. She denied any cardiac or
pulmonary history though she did have an admission to the Ea Health in 2/10 for shortness of breath. Clinical
diagnosis was apparently flash pulmonary edema as she had a normal
admission chest X-Ray which later revealed mild pulmonary vascular
redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure. She was
ruled out for a myocardial infarction and had an exercise tolerance
test which was negative for ischemic disease. She says she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion over the past six weeks with
substernal chest pain after climbing two flights of stairs.
Several weeks ago and again the day of admission , she has had
two-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was
well overall until five days ago when she started developing the
following symptoms: 1 ) &quot;Bone pain&quot; first in her hands and then
all over. 2 ) Fevers ( although she did not take her temperature ).
3 ) Chills. 4 ) Drenching sweats. 5 ) Anorexia. 6 ) Increasing
shortness of breath worsening over the week. 7 ) Pleuritic chest
pain worse with inspiration and laying on her left side. 8 ) Cough
and/or white vomitus ( one apparently induces the other but the
patient cannot distinguish which ). 9 ) Nose bleeds. 10 ) Neck
pain. 11 ) Sore throat. 12 ) Burning epigastric pain. 13 )
Abdominal bloating and diarrhea. 14 ) Black stools times one day.
15 ) Overall malaise. She denies hemoptysis , weight loss ,
photophobia , neck stiffness , runny nose , sneezing , radiation of
chest pain , dysuria , lower extremity edema , bright red blood per
rectum , or melena. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative for asthma ,
tuberculosis , or HIV risk factors. It is otherwise significant for
one episode of pulmonary edema of unclear etiology as noted above.
Her echo at that time was significant for a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 54% with increased left atrial size and mild
mitral regurgitation/aortic insufficiency. Her exercise tolerance
test was significant for not going nine minutes on a standard Bruce
protocol with a peak heart rate of 150 stopping secondary to
fatigue with blood pressure of 170/80 and no chest pain or ischemic
changes. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Tylenol p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No
known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Father with hypertension in
his sixties , mother died of a vaginal cancer at a young age ,
daughter has asthma , and brother has hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is separated , lives with three of five children , works as a
cleaning lady in various buildings in Ford , no tobacco , last
smoked at the age of 14 , and no alcohol or intravenous drug use.
She did have a history of exposure to typhus in her family
recently. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She had a weight gain of two pounds
over the past two months , her last period was during the week prior
to admission , and was shorter than usual.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient had a temperature of 100.8 , a
heart rate of 150 , blood pressure of 120/80 ,
respiratory rate of 30 to 35 , and O2 saturations of 93 to 96% on
three liters. She was mildly orthostatic on admission. GENERAL:
She was a tachypneic Spanish speaking woman in moderate respiratory
distress. HEENT: Remarkable for dry mucous membranes and a white
coating over her tongue but no erythema or exudate of her posterior
pharynx. NECK: Supple with tender submandibular shotty adenopathy
bilaterally. No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly. LUNGS:
Remarkable for diffuse crackles scattered throughout both lung
fields , louder in the mid and lower lung fields bilaterally , and no
egophony or dullness. HEART: Remarkable for tachycardia and
normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. BACK:
Revealed mild tenderness to palpation at both costovertebral angles
and there was no spinal tenderness. ABDOMEN: Soft with moderate
tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium , there was no
rebound or guarding , she had normal bowel sounds , no
hepatosplenomegaly , no Murphy&apos;s sign , and no masses. EXTREMITIES:
No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. SKIN: Without rash.
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed her to be alert and oriented
times three , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , and motor and
sensory examinations were intact. There were no cerebellar
findings and her reflexes were 1+ of the upper extremities and 0 at
the knees with toes downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , sodium was 137 , potassium
4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 15 ,
creatinine 0.9 , and glucose 145. Her white blood cell count was
20.7 with 71 polys , 14 bands , 9 lymphocytes , 4 monocytes , and 2
metamyelocytes. Her hematocrit was 45% and her platelet count was
322 , 000. Her room air blood gas revealed a pO2 of 66 , O2
saturation of 94.1% , pH of 7.46 , pCO2 of 34 , and an HCO3 of 25.
EKG was remarkable for sinus tachycardia at 152 beats per minute
with flat T waves in her limb leads and V5 and V6 , there were no
acute ST or T wave changes. When compared with prior EKG from
2/10 , the rhythm was much faster but in sinus. Her chest X-Ray
was remarkable for diffuse interstitial lung disease , increased
compared with a prior chest X-Ray of 10/3 Her liver function
tests were unremarkable on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE: After admission , the patient was started on
intravenous Bactrim and intravenous Erythromycin
in Legionella doses to cover her broadly for this interstitial
pneumonia. Sputum inductions were done for toluidine blue , gram
stain , and culture and sensitivity which were negative. An HIV
test was sent which was also negative making the diagnosis of PCP
very unlikely. She had Legionella antibody and urine antigens
sent. Although the urine antigens are pending , the Legionella
antibody came back positive at 1:256. At this titer , the diagnosis
of legionnaires&apos; disease was made. Until this titer came back ,
however , the diagnosis was not as clear and the patient had a PPD
planted with anergy panel. This PPD was negative and the patient
was not anergic. Pulmonary consultation was obtaind to consider
bronchoscopy as the patient could not produce sputum for the first
several days of her admission. As she was improving , the decision
was made to hold off on bronchoscopy. A typhus antibody was sent
given her possible exposure to typhus and that is still pending
although unlikely to be the case given her improvement on Bactrim
and Erythromycin and the fact that she has a positive Legionella
titer. Her gastrointestinal symptoms initially were felt to be
probably gastrointestinal complaints related to Legionella
legionnaires&apos; disease. Stool cultures were sent and eventually
came back negative and she was started on intravenous Pepcid later
switched to p.o. Pepcid. She was also vigorously hydrated for her
losses in her diarrhea. The cause of her marked sinus tachycardia
was unclear although it was probably secondary to stress. Her
heart rate eventually came down with fluids although she was not
markedly orthostatic on admission. With fluid repletion , her heart
rate did come down and subsequent EKG revealed that she was not in
AV flutter with a 2:1 block but indeed was in sinus tachycardia.
Over the subsequent days , her heart rate eventually normalized.
Her O2 saturations initially were in the low nineties with three
liters. With Erythromycin , her hypoxia markedly improved and by
the time of discharge , she was 98% on room air. As noted over the
subsequent days , she became afebrile with stable blood pressure and
improving respiratory rate and O2 saturations. This improvement ,
however , took at least two to three days before it became clear
that she was heading in the right direction. During her early
course , she started to have some abdominal distention with marked
discomfort in her belly. A nasogastric tube was placed with
suction and she was made NPO. Her amylase and lipase were normal.
Meanwhile , her white count did markedly improve and it appeared
that all of these symptoms were probably secondary to her primary
legionnaires&apos; disease. Cold agglutinins eventually came back
negative and her Mycoplasma titers are pending. Subsequent chest
X-Ray revealed that patient&apos;s process was at least radiographically
stable although she was clinically better. As noted above , her
white count improved and she remained afebrile except for single
episode of low grade fevers on 1/3 immediately prior to
discharge. She was thus watched for an additional day and was
discharged afebrile feeling well. Her course was also remarkable
for an increase in her ALT to 100 from a normal baseline probably
on the basis of Bactrim toxicity. After her Legionella titers came
back as well as her HIV being negative , her Bactrim was stopped and
she was switched from intravenous to p.o. Erythromycin. She
tolerated the switch well without any complications. She received
a total of seven days of intravenous Erythromycin and was
discharged with a two week course of p.o. Erythromycin.
DISPOSITION: Patient will follow-up in *tere Forestor- Medical Center Clinic in two weeks
for follow-up of her Legionella pneumonia. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times four weeks ,
Erythromycin 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. times two weeks , Tylenol 650 mg
p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. , and Maalox 30 cc p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature of 96.1 , heart rate of 70 ,
blood pressure of 120/60 in the right
arm. HEENT: PERRLA , dentition without evidence of infection , no
carotid bruits. CHEST: No incision. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular
rate and rhythm , with a systolic murmur with also a diastolic
rumble component , pulses 2+ throughout. RESPIRATORY: Rales
present bilaterally. Does not indicate how far up. ABDOMEN: Cyst
palpable liver , no mass noted , soft. RECTAL: Deferred.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ edema , with bilateral venous stasis ulcer , with no
signs of active infection. NEURO: Alert and oriented , with no
focal deficits.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Sodium of 141 , K of 4.5 , chloride
of 105 , CO2 of 26 , BUN of 32 ,
creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 110 , magnesium of 2.2. HEMATOLOGY:
White count of 7.5 , hematocrit of 32.3 , platelets of 216 , PT of 13 ,
with an INR of 1.1 , a PTT of 59.3. Cardiac catheterization was
done on 6/12/03 , which showed a 30% proximal LAD , right dominant
circulation , ventriculogram of 49 , PA mean of 30 , pulmonary
capillary wedge of 15 , cardiac output of 3.7 , and cardiac index of
2.2.
Patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service on 6/12/03 ,
needed a pre-op echo , which was obtained on 7/7/03 , which showed
mild LV hypertrophy with preserved overall systolic function , EF of
about 55% , with right ventricle with normal size and function ,
aortic valve mildly thickened; however , leaflet excursion is good ,
the peak transaortic velocity is 2 mm per second consistent with a
peak instantaneous gradient of 60 mmHg. The mitral annulus is
thickened and calcified. There is mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. The peak antegrade mitral velocity is 1.8 ,
consistent with a maximal gradient of approximately 12. The valve
area is estimated at approximately 1.8 cm2. Mild tricuspid
regurgitation was noted , with a regurgitant velocity of 2.5 ,
consistent with normal pulmonary systolic pressures. Due to her
nonhealing ulcer for which she has been evaluated by Derm for over
a year , patient was seen by Vascular Surgery to evaluate for
vascular compromise as a component of these nonhealing ulcers.
ABIs were obtained , which showed both left and right ABIs greater
than 1 , also PVRs were normal throughout and it was felt that there
was no vascular component to these nonhealing ulcers , and they
recommended that it was due to venous stasis changes and chronic
edema and felt local wound care and leg elevation would be the
treatment of choice at this point. Patient , with some evidence of
poor dentition , was seen by the Dental Team , which felt that there
was no evidence of active infection at this time that needed
further dental treatment prior to her surgery. Due to her plan for
valve replacement , patient was empirically started on vancomycin ,
levofloxacin , and Flagyl for coverage of these nonhealing ulcers.
Patient was also seen by Dermatology , who felt these were venous
stasis ulcers and recommended Hibiclens wash , as well as Silvadene
dressing with Xeroform gauze , and leg elevation , and also
recommended lower noninvasive to rule out DVT , which was obtained
on 4/25/03 which showed no evidence of DVT. On 8/11 patient was
taken down to the operating room and underwent a mitral valve
replacement , with preservation of the posterior mitral leaflet , and
had a Hancock porcine valve placed. Total cardiopulmonary bypass
time was 126 minutes. Cross-clamp time was 89 minutes. Patient
came off the heart-lung machine on Levophed and was paced with an
internal pacer and was started on some IV amiodarone for
uncontrolled A fib immediately coming off the heart-lung machine.
Over the next few hours , patient had frequent ectopy over the pacer
and the Cardiology Team was consulted. With interrogation of the
pacer , they felt that she was having frequent infranodal ectopy ,
but the pacer itself with the AV function was functioning normally.
The AF suppression was temporarily turned off , which they felt may
stabilize the rate and decrease the amount of ectopy that was seen
on the monitor. Over the next several days , patient with the
amiodarone drip had better rate control , with suppression of also
the intrinsic A fib that she had preoperatively , and on post-op day
#3 was switched over to Lopressor from amiodarone , per
recommendation of Cardiology. Patient was extubated on post-op day
#1 and required heavy diuresis over the next several days to wean
off her O2 , but by day of discharge was weaned off O2. Chest x-ray
looked slightly wet , so patient will continue on diuresis at the
rehab center. The patient with improvement of her venous stasis
ulcers; however , they are still open , and with discussion with the
Cardiac Surgery chief fellow it was discussed that until they were
healed with new valves in place that they would like to continue
the triple antibiotics of vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl , and
will be discharged to the rehab with those antibiotics. The
levofloxacin and Flagyl can be as p.o. and vancomycin as IV. The
patient also had a PICC line placed for poor venous access , which
by x-ray was in good position and 43 cm in length.
The patient by post-op day #10 was in stable condition to be
transferred to the rehab facility , and will be discharged with the
following medications: Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.
constipation , Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. x 5 days and to reassess
further Lasix dosing , ibuprofen 200-800 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
pain , Levoxyl 50 mcg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl
500 mg p.o. t.i.d. until improvement of leg ulcer , Niferex 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Darvocet 100 one tablet q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Silvadene
1% topical b.i.d. to the venous stasis ulcer , vancomycin 1 g q.12h.
( hold for vancomycin trough &gt;15 ) , Coumadin , to check with hold q.d.

Discharge Date: 2/2/2006
ATTENDING: HAJDUK , COLUMBUS MD
DATE AND TIME OF DEATH: 1/18/06 at 2:20 p.m.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient was admitted on 2/12/06 with a
chief complaint of weakness and confusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This was a 70-year-old female with
CHF , coronary artery disease , diabetes , peripheral vascular
disease , and chronic renal insufficiency that was admitted on
2/12/06 for weakness and confusion. She had been recently
hospitalized on 3/25/06 through 10/28/06 and 10/16/06 through
9/4/06 for CHF exacerbation requiring aggressive diuresis.
Her weight on discharge on 9/4/06 was 85 kg. She did well
initially at home after discharge , but two days prior to
admission , had increasing somnolence and confusion with global
weakness causing the patient to fall without head trauma or loss
of consciousness. The patient had decreased p.o. intake and was
febrile to 99.5. On admission , her weight was 83.9 kg. She was
hypotensive with blood pressures of 100/50. Her JVP was elevated to
15 and 3+ pitting edema. She had a BNP of 2321 and a white cell
count of 18.9.
Assessment: An assessment on admission suggested that the
patient possibly had hypoperfusion secondary to over diuresis or
worsening heart failure secondary to a cardiac event with a note
of having a troponin of 2.61.
Hospital Course: Her hospital course after admission on 2/12/06 was
complicated by worsening cardiac function with minimal improvement on milrinone
and decreasing urine output despite diuretics and also gross gastrointestinal
bleeding with melanotic stool while she was on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation. In addition , there was concern for sepsis. The patient was on
antibiotics with levofloxacin , Flagyl , and vancomycin. She required a transfer
to the Cardiac Care Unit on 11/19/06 for further medical therapy for poor
cardiac output , a
possible need for CVVH , given volume overload in the setting of renal failure ,
and work-up of GIB. Her code status was DNR/DNI during her admission into the
CCU on 7/25/06. The patient reversed her status to DNR , but allowed for
elective intubation on 11/19/06 , given her increasing GI bleed and the
worsening renal failure. The patient was electively intubated on 10/30/06
without any complications. For her GI bleed , she had an EGD and colonoscopy ,
which found a
gross large ascending colorectal mass with ulcerations , which likely
contributed to her gross GI bleed. Given the patient&apos;s wishes to
be DNR/DNI and given her new finding for a large mass in the
ascending colon , the patient&apos;s code status was changed to comfort
measures only on 4/20/06. In addition , her colorectal mass pathology returned
showing poorly differentiated tumor with lymphoma versus adenocarcinoma being
most likely as the diagnosis. For the above reason , the patient was also made
CMO.
Being CMO status , she was removed of all pressors and
antibiotics in the morning of 4/20/06. She was made comfortable sedated on
fentanyl and Versed. She was then extubated for comfort with family present.
She had agonal breathing with episodes of apnea and was given additional
sedation for comfort. The patient drew her last breath at 2:20 p.m. Her
family was present at bedside. The attending was aware.
On assessment , the patient had no spontaneous breathing , no corneal reflex ,
and no peripheral pulses. The patient&apos;s eyes were dilated and no heart
sounds or breath sounds were appreciated. Given the CMO status ,
no CPR was undertaken. The patient was pronounced dead at 2:20
p.m. on 4/20/06. Family declined autopsy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypoxia.
2. Acute renal failure.
3. Congestive heart failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath , ____ MS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with end-stage renal disease ,
not yet on hemodialysis; hypertension; insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , who is legally blind; hypothyroidism. The patient of
note had a recent AV fistula placed. The patient was admitted to
the Burg Memorial Hospital initially on 3/9/04 through
5/14/05 for hypoglycemic arrest , during at which time she was
resuscitated with full mental recovery. The patient was
subsequently discharged to the Carewin ,
and was readmitted on 9/16/05 through 10/10/05 for left toe
ulceration , which required operating room debridement , and
intravenous antibiotics , including vancomycin , levofloxacin and
Flagyl. The patient was subsequently transitioned to p.o.
clindamycin at the time of discharge , and discharged back to the
Mevent Healthcare The patient subsequently
presented on 9/30/05 per the report of the C
The patient was noted to have intermittent confusion and hypoxias
to 85% on room air on the morning of admission. The patient was
sent to the Medar Emnew Litvange Troyettedea Region General Hospital emergency room where she was
found to be normotensive at 138/83 , with an O2 saturation of 88%
on room air , augmented to 100% on nonrebreather. Physical
examination at the time of admission was remarkable for bilateral
crackles , two-thirds of the way up bilaterally. Chest is
remarkable for vascular congestion , question of right lower lobe
infiltrate. Of note , laboratory values on admission were
remarkable for BUN of 18 , and the creatinine up of 54 , elevated
from prior creatinine reading on 10/10/05 of 2.7. Her brain
natriuretic peptide on admission was measured at 2200. The
patient was subsequently admitted to General Medical Service
under the attending physician , Dr. Clarence Stephan Cler , for further
evaluation and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Remarkable for end-stage renal disease. The patient with the
right AV fistula in place , not yet on hemodialysis , hypertension ,
and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient is legally
blind , the patient with hypothyroidism , the patient with recent
right toe ulceration , requiring operating room debridement; the
patient with a history of hypoglycemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Include aspirin , atenolol , calcitriol , PhosLo , calcium carbonate ,
Colace , heparin , NPH , Regular Insulin sliding scale ,
levothyroxine , oxycodone p.r.n. , timolol , amlodipine , Dilantin ,
Protonix , clindamycin , Cozaar , and Lasix.
ALLERGIES ON ADMISSION:
Include penicillin and metolazone.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Not significant. The patient was previously residing at the
Nstrop Roll Memorial Medical Center
LABORATORY DATA:
Full laboratory panel on admission includes sodium of 133 ,
potassium of 5.4 , chloride of 103 , bicarbonate of 21 , BUN of 80 ,
elevated from 53 of several days prior; creatinine of 5.4 ,
elevated from 2.7 of several days prior; glucose of 43; white
count of 10.5; hematocrit of 25.4 , down from 28.9 of several days
prior; platelets of 315 , 000; INR of 1.5. Cardiac enzymes were
negative for any evidence of coronary insufficiency. Chest film
as mentioned previously demonstrated prominent bibasilar
pulmonary vasculature , mild cardiomegaly , and question of right
lower lobe infiltrate. EKG was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Renal: The patient presented with acute and chronic renal
insufficiency. Prior creatinine measured at 2-3. At the time of
admission , the creatinine was 5.4. Peak creatinine was measured
at 6.0. The patient was seen by the Renal Consult Service for
further evaluation of his acute renal failure. The patient was
felt to have gadolinium-induced nephropathy given her prior
chronic renal insufficiency and recent MRA , which had been
obtained to evaluate for peripheral vascular disease. Over the
time of admission , the patient was felt to be significantly
volume overloaded secondary to this acute renal failure , with
patient&apos;s weight up approximately 50 pounds from her baseline
value , and given her chest x-ray consistent with acute pulmonary
congestion , the patient was started on a Lasix drip with Diuril
support with significant improvement in her volume status. The
patient diuresed significantly over the time of admission.
Admission weight was recorded at 129.9 kg. At the time of
discharge , the patient had diuresed down to a dry weight of 95.6
kg , felt to be her dry weight. The patient was subsequently
restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
Recommend further outpatient titration and Lasix dosing as
required to maintain her ins and outs at approximately even.
Additionally , the patient on a fluid-restricted diet of 2.5
liters per day. The patient to follow up with her outpatient
nephrologist at the Sir Medical Center as per the discharge
instructions.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient with significant volume overload
secondary to acute renal failure. The patient was diuresed of
the hospital course as previously described. Recommend
outpatient evaluation as required.
3. Pulmonary: The patient with hypoxia on admission secondary
to acute pulmonary congestion. With significant diuresis , the
patient&apos;s hypoxia resolved. At the time of discharge , the
patient was on room air with O2 saturation greater than 92%. Of
note , the patient with occasional desaturation occurring at night
while sleeping , felt to be secondary to peripheral obstructive
sleep apnea. Recommend further outpatient evaluation and
supplemental oxygenation as required at night.
4. Heme: The patient with significant anemia secondary to both
iron deficiency and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient was
maintained on Epogen and iron supplementation. Additionally ,
given a significant bilateral lower extremity edema on admission
with hypoxia , concern for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound is negative for any
evidence of clot.
5. Endocrine: The patient with significant hypothyroidism ,
maintained on Levoxyl. Recommend outpatient evaluation as
required. Additionally , the patient with a history of
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , maintained on NPH b.i.d.
with Regular Insulin sliding scale supplementation. At the time
of discharge , the patient&apos;s NPH was at 12 units subcutaneous
b.i.d. with Regular Insulin sliding scale supplementation q.a.c.
at bedtime. Recommend titration as required to an A1c less than
7.5. Of note , the patient with significant hypoglycemia in the
past , particularly in the setting of infection or low p.o.
intake , so we would recommend caution.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient was on subcutaneous heparin 5000
units t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis in addition to Protonix 40 mg.
7. Musculoskeletal: Recommend physical therapy rehabilitation
as tolerated.
8. Code status: The patient adamantly DNR/DNI per her own
wishes.
9. Infectious disease: The patient noted to have persistent
diarrhea with minor abdominal pain at the time of admission. C.
diff colitis was found to be positive. The patient was therefore
treated with two-week course of p.o. Flagyl 500 mg q.8h. x14
days , and given concern initially for right lower lobe pneumonia ,
the patient was treated with a 14-course of levofloxacin ,
titrated to her renal function. At the time of discharge , the
patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stable. The patient was
tolerating food and physical therapy at baseline level. The
patient to be transferred back to the Du Hospital for further physical therapy rehabilitation.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient to follow up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Goodpaster at the SNHO Freoaknafre Clinic. In addition , the patient is
scheduled for follow-up appointment with THHC Nephrology , Dr.

Discharge Date: 6/29/1994
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78-year-old male
without significant past medical
history who presented to Casasrh Hospital with chest pain , ruled
in for an acute myocardial infarction and received thrombolysis.
The patient had persistent chest pain and was transferred to the
Santmi County Hospital for further evaluation. Cardiac risk
factors include no family history , no diabetes , no
hypercholesterolemia , very distant smoking history , male , and no
hypertension. The patient developed 6/10 substernal chest pain
radiating to his left arm , associated with nausea and shortness of
breath while he was sitting in his car on the morning of admission.
An hour later , he reached Rougeuc Care where his vital signs
revealed a blood pressure of 170/90 , heart rate was 85 , lungs were
clear to auscultation and an EKG which showed anterior ST
elevations with peak T waves. He was treated with front loaded
TPA , IV Heparin , IV Nitroglycerin , aspirin , Lopressor , but
continued to have substernal chest pain and ST elevations. He was
treated with Morphine and managed to sleep intermittently but every
time woke up with persistent pain. An echocardiogram performed at
the Ghamkins Hospital revealed a normal ejection fraction ,
inferior , posterior and septal hypokinesis. Given his persistent
chest discomfort , he was transferred to the Oux Ceny&apos;s Medical Center for post-thrombolysis , angioplasty.
The patient went directly to cardiac catheterization which revealed
the following; he had a right dominant system with two serial 90%
stenosis in the mid LAD , no abnormalities in the RCA , or left
circumflex artery , hemodynamics revealed an LVEDP of 14. LV gram
revealed apical hypokinesis with otherwise normal left ventricular
size , and function , right after that he underwent angioplasty of
his left anterior descending artery with successful results
( stenosis 90% down to 30 and 20% respectively ). Of note , he did
have TIMI grade 2 to 3 flow prior to angioplasty. The patient was
then transferred to the CCU without chest pain. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: This is notable for benign prostatic hypertrophy , status
post TURP , he is also status post an appendectomy. HABITS: The
patient is an x-smoker with a 48 pack year history , quite 30 years
ago. He drinks alcohol socially. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At
the time of admission , the patient was on no medications at home ,
however , medications on transfer were; Lopressor 50 mg po bid ,
aspirin 160 po q d , IV Nitroglycerin at 50 micrograms an hour ,
Heparin at 1000 units an hour. ALLERGIES: The patient has no
known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: There is no known coronary
artery disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient use to work in
construction , he lives with his wife and has two children. His
granddaughter is a nurse at Lemh In Of Medical Center .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was an elderly
male , sleepy , no apparent distress. His
blood pressure was 110/80 , heart rate was 62 , respiratory rate was
18. 93% oxygen saturation on six liters. The HEENT examination
showed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round and
reactive to light and accommodation , oropharynx was benign. Neck
was supple without lymphadenopathy. There was no thyromegaly.
Chest was clear to auscultation. Cardiac carotids were 2+ without
bruits. There was a regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , there was a
soft S4. There was no S3 , no murmurs. Abdomen soft with good
bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal was guaiac negative at
Skyrael Dowdale Onew Vi Savar University Of Medical Center . The patient&apos;s extremities showed no edema ,
pedal pulses were intact bilaterally. Right femoral sheath in
place.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , the patient&apos;s potassium was 3.8 ,
creatinine was 1.2 , creatinine kinase 960 with 99
MBs , white count was 9 , hematocrit 34.3 , PT and PTT was greater
than 110. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 80 , left axis
deviation , negative 35 , first degree heart block , 2 mm ST
elevations in V2 to 3 , Q waves in V1 to 5 , and small inferior Q
waves. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral low lung volume with mild
pulmonary edema. His cholesterol was 173.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 78-year-old man who is
status post an acute myocardial infarction treated
with front loaded TPA with persistent chest pain and ST elevations
now status post acute angioplasty of his LAD , admitted to the CCU
for further management. He was continued on IV Heparin and IV
Nitroglycerin , Lopressor , and aspirin. The patient was pain free
following angioplasty and his EKG post-angioplasty , showed
improvement in his anterior ST segments with evolution consistent
with an anterior myocardial infarction. The patient&apos;s post-MI
course was relatively uncomplicated with a peak CK of 960 , with 99
MBs ( with which he presented on admission ). By hospital day two ,
he had a CK of 336 , and 19 MBs. The patient was continued on IV
Nitroglycerin for 48 hours and was weaned to Nitropaste and
continued on IV Heparin for a total of five days. The patient was
also diuresed gently and within a few days had good oxygenation on
room air. The patient had a submaximal ETT MIBI prior to discharge
on hospital day seven , and went 9 minutes on a modified Bruce
without chest pain or dyspnea. The patient&apos;s maximal heart rate
was 120 , and maximal blood pressure was 180. EKG showed
normalization of his T-waves but no other diagnostic changes
consistent with ischemia. MIBI images revealed very mild
reversible ischemia in the apex , and apical portion of the inferior
wall. The patient will be discharged on a cardiac regimen which
includes Lopressor , aspirin , Captopril which was initiated a few
days prior to discharge , he will also be given sublingual
Nitroglycerin prn. The patient is scheduled to follow up with a
full Bruce ETT MIBI on 29 of November , to complete his risk ratification.
He is also scheduled for an echocardiogram the same day. The
patient will follow-up with Dr. Alberto Manual in Cardiology at the
Fris Rehabilitation Hospital Of and Dr. Trickey at Park Hospital .
Of note , the patient complained of significant dysphagia while
lying supine status post cardiac catheterization and upon more
complete history it became apparent that he has had dysphagia for
quite some time. The patient denied significant weight loss but
has had trouble with both solids and liquids. A video swallow was
obtained which revealed no aspiration and normal swallowing
mechanism and a barium swallow was noted for significant esophageal
dismotility and tertiary contractions. These results have been
communicated to his primary physician ( Dr. Gonthier who will follow ).
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge ,
the patient was stable. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
At the time of discharge , the patient was on Lopressor 50 mg qid ,
aspirin 325 mg q d , Captopril 6.25 mg tid , sublingual Nitroglycerin
prn.

with dobutamine , seretide , and diuretics with good effect.
Course complicated by left leg cellulitis and worsening renal
functioning on ACE inhibitor. Two weeks prior to presentation ,
the patient was seen in clinic with fluid retention , diuretics
were increased , then had worsening renal function , so diuretics
was held and now presented with fatigue , leg edema , and draining

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Sodium 129 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 133 , creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit
31.9 , white blood cell count 15.8 with 89% polys , 8 bands , and
INR 4.6 , albumin 2.7 and total bilirubin 3.4 , and normal
transaminases. ECG showed atrial fibrillation at 90 per minute ,
low voltage , poor R-wave progression with QRS widening , and
nonspecific T-wave abnormality.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to Cardiology Service for continued
management of his volume overload , dilated cardiomyopathy , and
lower extremity infections. This hospital course will be
summarized briefly by dates.
1. On 11/21/03 , the patient was found to have progression of his
right lower extremity infection and was taken to the OR for
debridement.
2. On 10/8/03 , Diuril was added to his regimen and his
creatinine was noted to increase from 2.6 to 3.6 and diuretics
were subsequently held.
3. On 6/25/03 , the patient retuned to the OR for revision of
right wound infection and underwent a further transmetatarsal
amputation.
4. On 5/5/03 , the patient noted nausea , fatigue , and malaise
coincident with 20-beat run of VT followed by syncope in the
stetting of dobutamine. The VT terminated spontaneously. The
patient was loaded on amiodarone , unfortunately still required
low dose dobutamine to maintain his cardiac output.
5. On 11/2/03 , the patient returned to the OR for debridement
and was noted to be hypotensive with baseline systolic blood
pressures of 80s going to 60s over palp with decrease urine
output. He was transferred to the CCU briefly and did well on
ionotropes and diuretics. He was transferred back to the floor
and continued to have decrease urine output on maximal diuretic
doses and ionotropes.
6. On 6/5/03 , the renal surgery recommended that the dobutamine
be stopped in order to enhance renal perfusion and Lasix be
increased to 80 mg per hour. The patient promptly developed
cardiogenic shock with discontinuation of dobutamine and was
again transferred to the CCU with systolic blood pressures in the
60s. He was ashen and cold. Subsequently , he has required
dobutamine between 1 and 2.5 mcg/kg/minute to maintain his
cardiac output as well as CVVH for volume management. He has
tolerated the FL rates between 15 and 200.
7. On 4/28/03 , the patient noted hoarseness. Otolaryngology
evaluation demonstrated paralyzed left vocal cords thought to be
secondary to left atrial enlargement or potentially the placement
of a left IJ catheter.
8. On 5/6/03 , a tunneled catheter was placed for hemodialysis
and CVVH access with plan initiation of hemodialysis.
9. On 10/30/03 , he had first course of hemodialysis and he
tolerated this procedure well. A PICC line was placed. The
patient was given a pneumococcal vaccine.
10. Cardiovascular:
a. Pump: The patient with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy with
poor overall prognosis , was admitted for aggressive diuresis in
order to improve his position on the ?? ?? curve. This was
performed by CVVH and is now being transitioned to hemodialysis.
He has beyond less invasive measures such as digoxin and ACE
inhibitors , and he is now dobutamine dependent.
b. Ischemia: The patient without any history of ischemic heart
disease and no symptoms suggestive of any incorporate lesions.
c. Rhythm: Chronic AF and occasional ectopy and VT on
dobutamine , currently loaded on amiodarone without any further
events.
11. Infectious Disease: The patient with chronic osteomylitis ,
currently in a six-week course of ceftazidime , vancomycin ,
Flagyl , and Diflucan for complicated osteomyelitis , end date is
on 9/27/03. He was given pneumococcal vaccine. He is
up-to-date on his flu vaccine.
12. Renal: The patient has had progressive renal failure likely
secondary to low flow to the kidneys. This has been exacerbated
by ACE inhibitors in the past. In addition , increasing doses of
diuretics have been ineffective that the patient is able to
obtain increased amounts of cardiac output. As he comes on
strongly through , he may regain some renal function , however , it
is predicted that he will require hemodialysis for remainder of
the life. He has tolerated this. A tunneled catheter was placed
for access on 10/20/03.
13. Vascular: The patient with peripheral vascular disease now
status post transmetatarsal amputation. He remains with a open
wound in his left foot and a calf ulcer. The patient is planned
to be evaluated by Plastic Surgery prior to discharge for final
plans whether a flap or healing by secondary retention.
14. Psychiatry: The patient is depressed with frequent periods
of anxiety , exceedingly fearful of dying , and unable to sleep
with light off or with drapes pole secondary to believe that if
he falls asleep , he will no longer wake up. He was seen by
Psychiatry , who suggested starting low dose of Zyprexa in the
evening. This has greatly improved his mood and he is doing well
from this regard.
15. Endocrine: The patient failed a course of stimulation test
and was started on hydrocortisone. When this was tapered down ,
he had some periods of hypotension and this was increased again.
He remains on maintenance doses of hydrocortisone. Etiology of
his adrenal insufficieny is unclear. Additionally , the patient
has diabetes. He was on oral hypoglycemic as an outpatient ,
however , now this renal function , he has been transitioned over
to insulin with his standing doses of Lantus with a lispro
sliding scale.
16. FEN: The patient was started on TPN for quite severe
malnutrition. He now has increasing albumin with increased
appetite , and he is tolerating more food. He has been placed on
nectar thick liquids for secondary to left vocal cord paralysis
and visualized aspiration on barium swallow by ENT.
DISPOSITION:
The patient currently is stable.
PLAN:
At this point , would be discharge with home dobutamine and
frequent and careful follow up by his primary cardiologist Dr.

ATTENDING: PALMER JEANGILLES MD
SERVICE:
General Medical Service Arb Gard Sa
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia associated with PICC line bacteremia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Diaphoresis and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Garrigan is a 68-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery
disease status post 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in
5/4 , hypertension , atrial fibrillation status post
cardioversion on Coumadin , hypercholesterolemia , aortic stenosis ,
status post aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valve ,
diabetes mellitus , cervical stenosis , as well as a recent
admission to the Land As Rohay Hospital for bilateral
brachial plexopathy of unknown etiology , who is receiving three
weeks of intravenous cefotaxime as empiric Lyme treatment as a
possible cause for his plexopathy , who presents with shortness of
breath. While at the Sieu Iebri General Hospital , the
patient developed shortness of breath one-and-a-half day prior to
admission. This was associated with significant diaphoresis and
fevers intermittently for four days prior to admission. Of note ,
the patient denied any dysuria , cough , sinus pain , diarrhea , ear
pain , pleuritic chest pain , calf pain , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , or orthopnea. The patient was taken to the emergency
department where a chest x-ray demonstrated a new right upper
lobe pneumonia. The patient was treated with levofloxacin in the
emergency department and admitted to the inpatient medical
service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post 2-vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting in 4/5
2. Hypertension.
3. Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion on Coumadin.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement
( bioprosthesis ).
6. Diabetes mellitus.
7. Bilateral brachial plexopathy of unknown etiology , but
attributed to Lyme disease. The patient was being treated four
with three weeks of IV cefotaxime. This brachial plexopathy had
improved to the point where the patient was able to lift his arms
and do his own ADLs. When he first presented with this
condition , the patient had a near complete paralysis of his motor
function in his upper extremities without loss of his sensory
function , per report.
8. Cervical stenosis and foraminal stenosis , as well as
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin 1000 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 500 mg p.o.
q.p.m. , simvastatin 5 mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ,
Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d. , which had been tapered down to 300 mg
q.d. , and then plan for discontinuation , Nexium 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Senna ,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , methadone 5 mg p.o. p.r.n. pain , and
regular insulin sliding scale , and cefotaxime 2 g IV injections
t.i.d. ( final dose on the day of admission ).
SOCIAL HISTORY: Resident at the Mi Ville for the past three
weeks. He is married. Tobacco history , one-and-a-half packs per
day , smoking x40 years but has quit. No alcohol use. Over the
past seven years.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , afebrile , pulse 80s , blood
pressure 126/72 , and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters. General
appearance: Not acutely in distress , talking in full sentences ,
ruddy appearing in the face , but stable per the patient. Head
and neck exam revealed pupils that were equally round and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. No sinus
tenderness. JVP was around 9 cm , no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2 , 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the upper sternal border. Chest
exam: Bibasilar crackles and right-sided bronchial breath sounds
and question focal wheeze. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. Extremities: No edema.
Warm and well perfused.
LABORATORY DATA:
Admission laboratory values included a Chem-7 within normal
limits with a creatinine of 0.8 and glucose of 181. White blood
cell count of 9.8 , hematocrit of 33.6 , and platelets of 222 with
a differential of 88% neutrophils. Liver function tests are
significant AST of 45 , ALT of 65 , alkaline phosphatase 153 , and
total bilirubin 0.5 , yet these liver function tests quickly
corrected the next morning of an AST of 21 , ALT of 47 , alkaline
phosphatase 123 , total bilirubin 0.5 , CK of 31 , CK-MB of 1.7 ,
troponin of less than assay , and amylase of 23. Chest x-ray
showing a right upper lobe wedge-shaped infiltrate , mild
cardiomegaly , and mild pulmonary edema. Electrocardiogram was
consistent with an old EKG from 2004 , normal sinus rhythm at 82 ,
now with slightly increased widening of the QRS complex in a left
bundle-branch block pattern , hyperacute T waves in V4 and V3.
IMPRESSION:
A 68-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems and
bilateral brachial plexopathy of unclear etiology , now improving ,
who presents with new right upper lobe infiltrate in the presence
of having an indwelling PICC line in place for IV antibiotics
over the past three weeks as well as a bioprosthetic valve.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious disease: The patient was admitted for likely
hospital-acquired pneumonia given his long hospitalization and
rehabilitation stays recently. The patient was pancultured. The
PICC line was discontinued and the tip was cultured. The patient
was covered broadly initially with vancomycin , as well as
ceftazidime. On further review of the culture data during the
hospital course , the patient began to grow coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus that was resistant to methicillin from both the
PICC line culture , as well his blood cultures from 11/10/05. His
chest CT was significant for an extensive area of ground glass
opacity in the right upper lobe with smaller areas in other
lobes. Bilateral mediastinal adenopathy was noted. Infection
was thought to be the most likely diagnosis in view of the
rapidity of the chest film changes. Other possibilities included
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma or lymphoma per the radiologic
read , but was not consistent with the clinical presentation. Per
infectious disease consultation , the pneumonia could be
attributed to the MRSE PICC line bacteremia with secondary
seating. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 55%-60% , but with abnormal paradoxical
motion consistent with his postoperative status after aortic
valve replacement. The entire anterior wall was hypokinetic.
The right ventricular systolic function appeared to be normal.
The left atrial size was mildly dilated at 4.6 cm. The aortic
valve appeared to be normal functioning with trace aortic
regurgitation. Other valvular function appeared to be within
normal limits with exception of moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation and peak systolic pulmonary artery pressures of 31
mmHg plus right atrial pressure. No pericardial effusion was
seen and no evidence of endocarditis was observed. On follow up
chest x-rays throughout the hospital course , the patient&apos;s
infiltrate resolved with a chest x-ray on 5/11/05 showing clear
lungs and only prior cardiac surgery evident without worsening or
continued presence of the right upper lobe infiltrate. A new
PICC line was placed per infectious disease service
recommendations for continued intravenous treatment with
vancomycin for 7 to 10 days starting 48 hours after the last
blood culture was negative. Therefore , the last dose of his IV
antibiotics should be given on 2/18/05. To cover other
gram-negative sources for his pneumonia , the Infectious Disease
Service also suggested continuing and ceftazidime treatment as
well. Therefore , the patient will be discharged on both
intravenous vancomycin as well as intravenous ceftazidime
treatment. Because of the patient&apos;s inability to pay for the
visiting nurses to administer IV antibiotics at home , the patient
will be discharged to a rehabilitation center.
2. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: Given the patient&apos;s history of diabetes and shortness
of breath , the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction
with three negative cardiac enzymes. The patient was continued
on his anti-ischemic regimen including aspirin , statin , as well
as beta blockade. In the future , the patient should be
transitioned back to once a day dosing of beta blockade as an
outpatient.
Pump: The patient initially presented in mild volume overload.
The patient was maintained on his home dosing of Lasix with good
volume response. By the end of his hospitalization , the patient
was not requiring any oxygen supplementally and was discharged
with euvolemia.
Rhythm: The patient was admitted initially in normal sinus
rhythm status post cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. He
remained on Coumadin. He was placed on telemetry given some
increased widened intervals of his QRS complexes. Early in the
course of his hospitalization , the patient converted back to
atrial fibrillation. His rate was controlled with beta blockade.
The Sternta Center And was asked to comment. The patient
was maintained on both beta blockade as well as digoxin. He also
continued on anticoagulation with Coumadin. Interestingly , the
Cardiovascular Service suggested that possibly some ground-glass
opacities on the patient&apos;s chest CT could be attributed to
amiodarone lung toxicity. Because of this finding , it was
recommended that the patient stop the amiodarone , which was
indeed discontinued through this hospitalization. He should
follow up with his cardiovascular group as an outpatient to
determine further course of treatment for his atrial
fibrillation.
Anticoagulation: The patient will continue to be treated with
Coumadin for goal INR between 2 to 3. By the end of this
hospitalization , the patient&apos;s INR was 1.7 on a dose of Coumadin
7 mg p.o. q.h.s. That dose was increased to 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
The patient should have his INR checked within two days after
discharge and have his Coumadin dose changed appropriately.
3. Neurologic: The patient was admitted on a previous
hospitalization with a history of bilateral brachioplexopathy.
It had been attributed to possible line infection given a history
of a tick bite. He was treated empirically with three weeks of
IV cefotaxime with moderate improvement of motor function while
at rehabilitation. Interestingly , upon further review of Lyme
disease workup , the patient apparently had a negative serology
for Treponema pallidum IgG. Confirmatory tests , which included a
Lyme disease titer was still marked as pending in our computer
system at the Ardbroo Worth-son Bu Elstownw. Raph Hospitals . Despite multiple
attempts to try to contact the laboratory , which runs this
particular tests , we were unable to confirm or deny the presence
of past Lyme infection. Therefore , at this time , we can only
state that his bilateral brachioplexopathy was secondary to an
unknown and unclear etiology. Fortunately , with physical therapy
and with time and possibly with infusion of the IV cefotaxime ,
the patient&apos;s motor function has improved. At the time of this
discharge , the patient&apos;s overall upper extremity motor strength
was 4+/5 symmetrically. The patient should follow up very
closely with his primary care physician as well as his
neurologist in one month. At that time , his neurologist should
confirm or negate the possibility that the patient&apos;s neurologic
symptoms may have been caused by Lyme disease. The patient
should continue physical therapy at rehabilitation and as an
outpatient. In addition , the patient should continue his
Neurontin taper. He currently is on 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. and
should be tapered to nothing by the end of his hospitalization
and rehabilitation. He will continue on methadone for his
chronic pain. In addition , he suffers from significant anxiety.
He will be discharged on p.r.n. Ativan at low-dose , as higher
doses tend to make him sleepier and oversedated.
4. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with diabetes mellitus.
He was initially admitted with taking metformin 1000 mg p.o.
q.a.m. and 500 mg p.o. q.h.s. Because of his hospitalization and
multiple studies , this was discontinued transiently and he was
placed on a regular insulin sliding scale. At the end of this
hospitalization , he will be placed back on those home doses of
metformin. In addition , he will continue his ACE inhibitor for
his diabetes , as well as for his significant cardiac disease.
5. Pulmonary: Much of his pulmonary process can be attributed
to his pneumonia as treated in the statements above. In
addition , he will continue on p.r.n. Atrovent and albuterol
nebulizer treatment for possible wheezing during his
hospitalization. In addition , it is hoped that the Ativan p.r.n.
dosing also contribute to less subjective shortness of breath
secondary to alleviation of his anxiety.
6. Gastrointestinal: The patient , periodically , throughout his
hospitalization complained of mild epigastric pain. A KUB showed
no perforation and no obvious obstruction , but with many loops of
bowel with stool. He was placed on a bowel regimen including
Colace , senna , and Dulcolax p.r.n. By the end of this
hospitalization , he appeared to be less symptomatic. In
addition , he will continue his trial of simethicone p.r.n. for
abdominal gas and bloating. He will continue on his proton pump
inhibitor , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.
CODE STATUS:
He remains full code throughout his hospitalization.
DISPOSITION:
The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation where he will
continue IV antibiotic support for until 2/18/05. He should
also continue physical therapy for his upper extremity motor
dysfunction. He should follow up with his primary care physician
as well as his neurologist as stated in his discharge summary.

Discharge Date: 10/6/2000
SERVICE: CARDIAC SURGERY.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 57-year-old black male with a
history of hypertension and coronary artery disease
admitted 25 of May with episodes of chest pain. In July 1993 ,
the patient presented with a lateral wall myocardial infarction and
was treated with angioplasty of the ramus branch. His course was
complicated by severe hypertension and pulmonary edema. Preserved
left ventricular function with mitral regurgitation were noted. He
presented again in October 1996 with recurrent pulmonary edema in
the setting of non-compliance and extreme hypertension. The
cardiac catheterization was remarkable for a 70% occlusion of the
mid-left anterior descending artery , an 80% of the diagonal 1 , an
occluded ramus , a 70% of the obtuse marginal 1 , diffuse disease of
the right coronary artery with a 70% at the posterior descending
origin , moderate mitral regurgitation , and preserved ejection
fraction. A coronary artery bypass graft was recommended but
refused at the time , and the patient was treated medically. In the
interval , the patient has had intermittent compliance with
medications. Over the last month , he has had calf claudication at
two to three city blocks , sometimes followed by chest pain. He
presented to the Emergency Room on May , 2000 , and on the
standard Bruce exercise tolerance test , went 5.9 and stopped with
right leg pain and chest pain. The EKG showed ST elevations in
leads V1-4. The patient was given aspirin and nitroglycerin. He
refused admission and further work-up. He again presented
25 of May after a walk in the park and incidentally noted markedly
elevated blood pressure , followed by chest pain. He came to the
Emergency Room. He had not taken his medications that morning.

Discharge Date: 1/18/2007
ATTENDING: ARBOLEDA , CORNELL MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pneumonia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 86-year-old female with past
medical history significant for atrial fibrillation , diastolic
CHF , rheumatic heart disease status post mitral valve
replacement and tricuspid repair , chronic renal insufficiency , prior small-bowel
obstruction and GI bleeding who presented with abdominal pain.
The patient reports sudden onset of abdominal pain approximately
one day prior to admission , which became progressively worse.
The patient was noted to have nausea and vomiting at home with
green/yellow fluid. The patient was suspected to have an
aspiration event per the patient&apos;s daughter. The patient denies
fever or chills. Denies dysuria. Denies shortness of breath or
cough. No recent antibiotics. No sick contacts.

patient was noted to have positive jugular venous distension , 3/6
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border , right lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation , abdomen soft and without
rebound tenderness. A chest x-ray was performed and a right
lower lobe infiltrate and moderate pulmonary edema was noted. A
KUB was also performed , which did not show any evidence of
obstruction. An abdominal CT demonstrated mild diffuse small
bowel thickening concerning for infection versus ischemia. The
patient was given ceftriaxone , azithromycin and Flagyl IV as well
as Lasix 40 mg IV x1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin , rheumatic heart disease status post bioprosthetic

CONSULTING SERVICES:
1. Gastroenterology.
2. Surgery.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology of abdominal pain on
presentation , but given history of mesenteric ischemia and
questionable small-bowel thickening on CT , the initial concern
GI and Surgical Services were consulted and followed the patient over
Hospital day #1. Serial CBC , lactate and anion gaps were
followed and showed no evidence of ischemia. By the evening of
hospital day #1 , the patient&apos;s abdominal pain had fully resolved
and the patient was initiated on clears. By the morning of
hospital day #2 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet.
Although no clear diagnosis could be made , the rapid resolution
of the patient&apos;s abdominal pain was thought to be most consistent
with viral enteritis. Given the patient&apos;s history of
atherosclerosis , further imaging of the abdominal vessels by MRA
during followup was recommended by the GI Service.
2. Pneumonia: Bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration
pneumonia. The patient was initially treated empirically with
ceftriaxone , azithromycin and Flagyl IV , which was switched to
cefpodoxime plus Flagyl p.o. on hospital day #2. The patient
became febrile on HD#4 ( 3/7/07 ) up to 101.9 and as such was switched
back to ceftriaxone , Flagyl and azithromycin IV after
which the patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of
her admission. The patient was discharged on 10/25/07 with
instructions to complete an additional six days of cefpodoxime ,
Flagyl and azithromycin p.o. for a total of 14 days of antibiotic
therapy. The patient was also given lactobacillus as a probiotic
agent.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient was noted in the ED to have a mild
oxygen requirement with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air ,
which improved to 97% on 2 L nasal cannula. The differential
diagnosis for the patient&apos;s hypoxemia included pulmonary edema
( seen on chest x-ray ) and pneumonia. The patient was given 40 mg
IV Lasix in the Emergency Department and was treated for
pneumonia as above. On Hospital day #2 , the patient&apos;s at rest
room air oxygen saturation was noted to be 95-97% , but decreased
to 85% with ambulation on room air. The patient was still
thought to be mildly hypervolemic and was gently diuresed. On
the day of discharge , the patient was noted to have a room air
saturation of 100% at rest and 95% with ambulation. The patient
was instructed to continue gentle oral diuresis at home and VNA
services were arranged to monitor her oxygen saturations and daily weight.
4. Anemia: History of GI bleeding , chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient&apos;s hematocrit was stable at baseline 33-36 throughout
her hospital admission. The patient was guaiac negative on
admission. An active type and screen was maintained throughout
admission. No evidence of GI bleeding throughout
hospitalization. The patient&apos;s hematocrit was 37.7 on admission
and 33.5 at discharge. The patient was given her weekly Procrit
5000 units subcutaneous injection on 10/25/07 prior to discharge.
The patient was instructed to resume iron supplementation after
discharge.
5. CHF: The patient&apos;s admission chest x-ray was suggestive of
pulmonary edema , possibly secondary to elevated blood pressure in
the setting of abdominal pain versus insufficient diuresis at
home. There was no evidence of acute ischemia on EKG. The
patient was gently diuresed during her admission. The patient&apos;s
dry weight is 57 kg. The patient&apos;s weight at discharge was 61
kg. Repeat chest x-ray on the morning of discharge still showed
evidence of pulmonary congestion and interstitial edema. As
such , the patient was thought to be still mildly hypervolemic at
the time of her discharge and was instructed to continue gentle
diuresis at home. The patient was discharged on Lasix 80 mg p.o.
twice daily , which is a slight increase from her home dose of 80
mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. The patient was instructed to measure
her weights daily and to follow up with her cardiologist , Dr.
Michele , for further titration of her diuretic dose.
6. Hypertension: The patient&apos;s blood pressure was elevated in
the ED up to 183/65 in the setting of abdominal pain and improved
over several hours to the 110-120s/60s-70s. On hospital day #2 ,
the patient&apos;s blood pressure was noted to be slightly elevated
from 130s-150s/70s. As such , the patient&apos;s valsartan and Norvasc
were restarted on hospital day #2. The patient&apos;s Imdur was
restarted on hospital day #4. The patient&apos;s blood pressure
remained well controlled during the remainder of her admission
ranging from 100-122/46-71 on her home regimen.
7. Atrial fibrillation: With pseudoregularization. The
patient&apos;s rate was noted to be well controlled. The patient&apos;s
Coumadin was held in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR likely
secondary to concurrent antibiotic use. The
patient&apos;s INR trended down to 2.1 on hospital day #4 and she was
restarted on a reduced dose of Coumadin. The patient&apos;s INR was
2.7 on the a.m. of discharge on Coumadin 1 mg nightly while still
on antibiotics as above. VNA Services were arranged to measure
her INR on 7/11/07 and to send the results to the WSMH Coumadin Clinic ,
915-360-5305.
7. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient&apos;s creatinine was
noted to be at baseline 2.7 on admission and slightly
increased creatinine to 3.2 at the time of discharge. In
contrast , the patient&apos;s BUN was 83 at discharge , down from 111 on
admission. The patient did not show evidence of contraction
alkalosis with bicarbonate=22 on a.m. of discharge. The
patient&apos;s BUN , creatinine and bicarbonate were to be rechecked on
7/11/07 with the results sent to Dr Banana ( Cardiology ) and
Dr. Bechman ( nephrology ) for further titration of her medications
as needed.
8. Diabetes: The patient was initially continued on home dose
Lantus and sliding scale insulin. Standing NovoLog insulin
q.a.c. was reinitiated as the patient&apos;s p.o. intake improved.
The patient&apos;s Lantus dose was titrated up to improve glucose
control during admission. However , the patient experienced
intermittent hypoglycemia at increased doses of Lantus and was
returned to her home dose of 8 units subcu nightly. At the time
of discharge , the patient was returned to her home insulin
regimen of Lantus 8 units nightly plus NovoLog 4 units with
breakfast , 4 units with lunch and 5 units with dinner plus
sliding scale insulin. The patient was instructed to continue to
monitor her blood glucose with meals.

Discharge Date: 3/23/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old man
from  Dr. , Ro Rouge Berkesti , South Dakota 20513 , with a his-
tory of ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure , who
was transferred to the Ret Health Services for transplant evalua-
tion. In 1975 , he suffered a myocardial infarction and subse-
quently had exertional angina. In 2 of March he suffered a second MI
and underwent three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 8 of May
At that time his ejection fraction was 21%. Over the ensuing
months , the patient noted markedly worsening symptoms of CHF with
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and dyspnea on exertion.
One week prior to transfer , the patient was admitted to Ment Hospital for management of his congestive heart failure. He was
initially treated with afterload reduction , digoxin and Lasix.
On this regimen , a PA line was placed with the following read-
ings: RA 8 , RV 76/4 , TA 80/36 , pulmonary capillary wedge pres-
sure 34 , and cardiac index 1.49. Echocardiogram revealed dilated
left ventricle with global hypokinesis , tricuspid regurgitation ,
and PA systolic pressure 80mmHg. The patient was treated with
dobutamine , intravenous TNG , and nitroprusside with symptomatic
relief and hemodynamic stabilization with wedge pressure falling
to 18. TNG and Nipride were successfully weaned. However , the
patient remained dobutamine dependent.
The patient was transferred to the Edpointe Soupied Cantjean Hospital for evalu-
ation for transplantation. At the time of admission he noted
dyspnea on minimal exertion but not at rest. He denied chest
pain , palpitations , lightheadedness , or syncope. The patient is
married , and worked as a janitor until October of 1991. He is
married with seven children and lives in S .
The patient&apos;s PAST MEDICAL HISTORY is significant for severe
abdominal trauma many years ago , having been gored by a bull.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Discharge physical examination is nota-
ble for a blood pressure of 100/50 , a
heart rate of between 100 and 110 , a respiratory rate of 18 , a
blood pressure of 112/66 , a temperature of 97.1 , and a weight of
80.4 kilograms. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm with occa-
sional short bursts of ventricular tachycardia last two days

HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Transplant Listing: The patient has
been listed for cardiac transplant ,
has had all the necessary preoperative workup including pulmonary
function tests and tissue typing. Should a heart become avail-
able , he could be Medivacked back to the Peters Of for surgery.
The patient&apos;s hospital course was significant for the following
workup: He had a catheterization 27 of January , which showed patent
grafts and occluded native left anterior descending and obtuse
marginal branch. An echocardiogram on 15 of July showed mitral regurg-
itation , an ejection fraction of less than 20% , and no vegeta-
tions on the valve.
The patient&apos;s most significant problem during his hospital course
included temperatures. On 26 of November , he had an increased temperature
to 101 and increased white count with left shift. His central
line was pulled , and the tip grew gram positive cocci. The
patient also grew gram positive cocci from two blood cultures.
He was started on vancomycin and defervesced , and has been
afebrile for four days.
Subsequently , the patient again became febrile approximately one
week into his vancomycin course. At this point he was recul-
tured , and those cultures grew gram negative rods in one out of
four blood culture specimens. These were gram negative enteric
rods , pan-sensitive , for which the patient was started on
ampicillin 2 gm IV q. 6. This was felt most likely secondary to
a urinary tract infection from the Foley catheter , which has been
discontinued.
At the time of discharge , the patient is stable , dobutamine
dependent , without chest pain , able to ambulate from chair to
commode without shortness of breath , palpitations , or light-
headedness. He is eager to be transferred back to the Ston area to await heart transplant.
With any questions , please contact Doctor Wilmer Priore Tucap Anathens Sol Health Services 783-7216 , beeper number 7360 , the patient&apos;s
medical intern.
The patient&apos;s condition at time of discharge is fair.
DISPOSITION: Continuing care in the coronary care
unit of the hospital inpatient near
patient&apos;s home. The patient will be under the care of a Doctor

ATTENDING: ROD GLEMBOCKI MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Right ankle fusion.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Status post right ankle fusion and
pneumonia.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Cleared history of heart transplant ,
history of rheumatic fever , diabetes mellitus type 1 ,
gastroesophageal reflux disease , chronic renal insufficiency , and
osteoporosis.
HISTORY: The patient is a 65-year-old woman with history of
rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis ultimately requiring
heart transplant in August of 1993 , diabetes mellitus type #1 ,
and chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.8.
He was admitted on February , 2003 , for elective right ankle
fusion. About 1 year prior to admission , she fell down stairs
and had a right pilon fracture initially treated with cast
immobilization. The patient noted persistent right lower leg and
ankle deformity and daily aching pain and decided with her
orthopedic surgeon to have an elective right ankle fusion. After
surgery , her vitals were 100.3 , 111 , respiratory rate of 18 ,
oxygen saturation of 98% upon 70% face mask. Exam was notable
for decreased breath sounds with wheezing with a positive S4.
JVP was difficult to assess. Extremities were warm with pitting
edema. Labs were notable for cyclosporin levels 133. EKG showed
no significant change consistent with June , 2003. She was
started on IV Lasix diuresis for proper fluid overload , as she
had received 4 L intraoperatively. She developed low-grade fever
and then up to 102 , and had left calf pain on palpation. A
spiral CT was sent that was negative for PE , DVT , or CHF , but
positive for atelectasis. The BUN to creatinine ratio trended
upwards up to 31/2.3 from 29/1.7 on admission and then she was
transferred to cardiology 3 for management of hypoxia , fever ,
acute and chronic renal failure , and developing hypertension to
the 90s , systolic from a baseline of 105. She was transferred to
cardiology on May , 2003. Her vitals on transfer were T
max 100.4 to current 99.2 , pulse 99 to 108 , currently 99 , blood
pressure was ranging to 90 to 102 over doppler to 60.
Respiratory rate of 18 , 97% on high flow of 100% oxygen. On
physical exam , she had bibasilar inspiratory crackles , left
greater than right and tachycardia around 100. Extremities were
warm with trace edema in the left lower extremity. Her labs at
that time were notable for white count of only 6.5. Creatinine
of 4.1 from 2.3 , and BUN of 41. She had a portable chest x-ray
that showed cardiomegaly and bilateral atelectasis with focal
opacity at the left lung base. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm
with 97 beats per minute. No ST changes , Q wave inversions in V1
and V3 , with RSR prime pattern. V1 that showed RS duration of 80
milliseconds , not significantly changed from February , 2003.
Echocardiogram on January , 2003 , had shown an ejection
fraction of 50% to 55% with mild left ventricular enlargement and
preserved systolic function , mild posterior and lateral
hypokinesis , normal right ventricular size and function , mitral
valves mildly thickened with mild MR. Stress echocardiogram on
February 2003 , showed no inducible ischemia. There was a
dobutamine protocol. Right heart cath in February of 2003 ,
showed a right atrial pressure of 21 , PCWP is 28. This time , she
was started on Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d , The labs were negative for
rejection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As noted above , rheumatic heart disease
status post heart transplant in 1993 , diabetes mellitus type 1 ,
GERD , chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of 1.8.
In 1985 , had septic stroke with brain abscess postoperative
status post MVR. History of MRSA , osteoporosis. Status post
cholecystectomy.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: Mag oxide , Tums p.r.n. , Niferex ,
Lexapro , multivitamin , Colace , Nexium , Lasix , Cyclosporin ,
prednisone , Imuran , Cozaar , Cardizem , aspirin , Nephrox ,
Pravachol , Fosamax , NPH 60 units q.a.m. 10 units q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes rash , codeine causes severe nausea
and vomiting.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Quit smoking in 1978 , rare alcohol , no IV drug
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , vitals were notable for
oxygen saturation in the 84% range on room air and tachycardia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Musculoskeletal: The operation was without complications with
minimal bleeding. She had a right leg cast placed after the
procedure. She has been followed by the orthopedic surgery team
initially on their service and then as a consulting team , once
she was transferred to medicine. She was able to move her toes
with the splint in place and there were no orthopedic
complications from the procedure. She will follow up with Dr.
Rutecki on March , 2003. She also worked with physical
therapy to peripheral functional status and will need physical
therapy as an outpatient 3 to 5 times per week. Her motion is
limited by decreased strength in the upper extremities , which
prevents her from performing NWB gait.
Cardiovascular: Initially it was difficult to assess whether she
was volume overloaded or euvolemic given the hypotension , but
elevated right heart filling pressure before the admission and a
chest x-ray that also revealed fluid in the fissure on the right.
She had poor urine output as well so she was given Lasix 120 mg
IV b.i.d. , to which she did not respond and the Lasix drip was
started. She was transferred to the CCU for possible sepsis
because her blood pressure continued to drop to the 60 and 70
systolic and required Dopamine IV. Once she was transferred to
the CCU , a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , which revealed SVR of
689 , and cardiac output of 5.8 consistent with sepsis. The right
heart filling pressures were high also. She was continued on IV
Lasix with good urine output response in the MICU and then was
subsequently transferred back to the cardiac team when her
hemodynamic status was improved. For ischemia , she was given
aspirin and her home Pravachol for her ischemic risk factors
including diabetes and high cholesterol. When she returned to
the floor , her diuresis remained good off the Lasix , possibly
related to post ATN diuresis and her ins and outs remained
negative. She was given her home prednisone 5 mg q.d. as well as
her home cyclosporin. She was also continued on Imuran.
Infectious Disease. Given the chest x-ray findings , she was
treated for pneumonia initially with broad covers with
vancomycin , azithromycin , and levofloxacin. All the blood and
urine cultures were negative. The workup for her infection was
negative and was presumed that she had community-acquired
pneumonia , and it responded well to levofloxacin 10-day course.
The vancomycin was discontinued in the MICU and the Ceptaz was
continued when she was transferred back the floor. On physical
exam on the day of discharge was improved with only faint
inspiratory crackles at the right base. She had two MRSA nares
cultures that were negative and a third one was pending on the
day of discharge. Stool cultures were sent that were negative as
well as sputum Gram stain and culture that was negative.
Renal: In the postoperative course , her creatinine rose
dramatically to the 5 range , also the possible etiology was
multifactorial including dye load with the CT , spiral , as well as
history of chronic renal insufficiency likely from diabetes and
chronic cyclosporin use. She was seen by renal consult and
during the course of the MICU stay , her renal function improved
dramatically back to the baseline and in the interim , she was
given Sevelamer for high phosphorus , but it was discontinued when
the phosphorus level came back normal.
Gastrointestinal: She was continued on Nexium , Lactulose , and
did not report any GI discomfort.
Hematology: She was given subcu heparin for prophylaxis and
Niferex.
Endocrine: During the period of hypotension , she was given test
dose steroids with hydrocortisone , and she responded well to this
and when she returned to the cardiology floor , her hydrocortisone
was tapered and she was then placed back on her home prednisone.
She was continued on her home NPH 60 units in the morning and 10
units at night. She did develop some hypoglycemic episodes that
were asymptomatic , the lowest glucose was 37 , so the evening dose
of NPH was reduced to 4 units. She was also covered with insulin
sliding scale while on steroids.
Respiratory: She was breathing comfortably on room on the day of
discharge.
Neurology: She did have some waxing and waning of her mental
status during the setting of hypotension and fever , although she
had a baseline slowed response to questioning. She was markedly
slower to respond to questioning but normally oriented to place
and person. By the time she was discharged she was back to her
baseline mental status as confirmed by her husband at bedside.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient will follow up with
orthopedics Dr. Hodnett on March , 2003. Physical therapy
needs to work with the patient 3 to 5 times a week to improve her
mobility and functional status as per physical therapy
recommendations during her stay here. Please call Lecer Nigein Sotarnock University Medical Center or look in the medical records to see what her third MRSA
culture report is for nares culture , if it is negative , then she
has had 3 negative MRSA cultures and does not need to be in MRSA
precautions any longer.
She needs to follow up with the heart transplant service in 2 to
4 weeks at Pen Broadl Memorial Hospital .

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: GEORGE HONG MARSKE MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Bradycardia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Include bradycardia , diverticulosis and
plantar fasciitis. Other diagnoses treated over the patient&apos;s
hospitalization includes insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , obstructive sleep apnea.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Operations and procedures over her
course include colonoscopy. No other procedures were performed.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , the patient is an
82-year-old woman with a history of insulin dependent diabetes
and hypertension who is in her usual state of health until the
morning of presentation when she was sitting at breakfast she
felt an increased in drowsiness and faintness with gradual onset
over ten minutes while seated. She felt as if she was going to
collapse but had no visual or motor deficit. She called her
daughter. Per report , the patient experienced no dysarthria or
confusion , no focal motor deficit. She stood and walked outside
noting no changes with standing. She denies fall or loss of
consciousness. She had some shortness of breath as well as
dyspnea on exertion. At baseline , she has poor exercise
tolerance to less than 30 feet without shortness of breath. On
the day of presentation this was reduced to less than ten feet.
She had no chest pain or palpitations , no cough but mild URI
symptoms. No fevers , chills , nausea or vomiting. She did have
one subjective temperature the day prior to admission , no change
in stools. She had some feeling of urinary frequency but no
burning , no leg pain or falls. She has had no recent change in
oral intake. Of note , the patient has had multiple presentations
to her primary care physician in the past for symptomatic
bradycardia for which her medication regimen has been repeatedly
changed. Of note , she was recently started on Clonidine for her
hypertension.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is notable for
insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , a history of a urinary
tract infection in the past , bradycardia , chronic edema in her
legs , obstructive sleep apnea. She has a history of a positive
PPD. She is allergic to Lisinopril which gives her angioedema as
well as CT contrast dye.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Her medications at the time of
admission include Avapro 75 mg b.i.d. , Clonidine 0.2 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , atenolol 100 mg p.o. daily , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily ,
insulin NPH 20 b.i.d. , Flonase , Lasix 40 b.i.d. She denies
tobacco or alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for cardiovascular or lung disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her exam showed a temperature of 95.5 , a
heart rate of 40 , blood pressure of 140/60 , respiratory rate of
18 , oxygen saturation 99% on room air. She is comfortable. She
is fatigued with no acute distress. Her extraocular movements
are intact. She has no scleral icterus. Her neck is supple with
a JVP of approximately 12. Her heart is regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 and S2 are normal. She is bradycardic. She has no murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. Lungs are clear bilaterally without wheezes or
rales. Her abdomen is obese but soft , nontender , no pulsatile
liver is appreciated. Extremities are warm and well perfused
with 3+ edema to the knees. She is alert and oriented x3. Her
reflexes are 2+ bilaterally , 5/5 strength in bilateral upper and
lower extremities. Her cranial nerves are all intact.
ADMISSION LABS: Admission labs are notable for a hematocrit of
35.8 , a BUN of 21 , and a creatinine of 1.4 which is essentially
at the patient&apos;s baseline. The patient had three sets of cardiac
enzymes which were all negative for ischemia. She had blood
cultures drawn which have returned no growth to date. Her TSH at
time of admission was 2.55 within the range of normal. Chest
x-ray showed low lung volumes , cardiomegaly without effusion or
consolidation. EKG was sinus rhythm 40 bpm , no Q waves , no T
wave inversions , no new ST segment elevation or depression. Her
QT corrected is 431 milliseconds. She had an echo January ,
2004 showing an ejection fraction of 65% and normal valves.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted for workup and
treatment of her symptomatic bradycardia. On reviewing the
patient&apos;s past medical records , it was noted that she had
experienced similar symptoms with episodes of bradycardia related
to medications in the past. She was noted to be on atenolol
which had been a longstanding medication for her as well as
Clonidine which had only been started in the preceding 2-3 days.
Atenolol was discontinued at the time of admission as it had
nodal blocking properties. Additionally , Clonidine was also
discontinued for its potential rare adverse reaction of causing
bradycardia and at times heart block. Her heart rate gradually
improved over the course of her admission and by the time of
dictation her heart rate ranged from 60-75 at rest. The patient
was evaluated while inhouse. The patient had no loss of
consciousness , anginal chest symptoms or worsening of her
hypertension during this period. She was evaluated by the
Cardiology Service at Peley Memorial Health on the day
following admission who found the patient likely not to require
pacemaker. The recommendation of the Cardiology Service
additionally recommended to hold Clonidine and consider
restarting atenolol at a low dose of 25 mg p.o. daily. The
patient was subsequently re-evaluated by the Electrophysiology
Service at the Tu Chihar Hospital which assessed the
patient to likely not require a pacemaker given her improvement
of her bradycardia with the discontinuation of her nodally active
medications. The patient was maintained on telemetry over the
course of her hospitalization with no new or dangerous
arrhythmias noted. In terms of ischemia , the patient had a
negative workup for cardiac ischemia by enzymes x3 and had no
further anginal symptoms or changes in her EKG to indicate
myocardial ischemia or infarction. In terms of her pump
function , the patient was assessed to be volume up at the time of
admission and treated with one dose of Lasix 40 IV. She was
subsequently continued on her outpatient dose of Lasix 40 p.o.
and will be discharged on Lasix 40 p.o. b.i.d. She was noted to
have some improvement in her lower extremity edema over her
hospital course but it was assessed to be chronic and likely not
an issue to be further assessed by her outpatient physician. In
summary , the patient will be discharged to home without further
use of atenolol. The recommendation of the hospital team is that
the patient continue on her discharge medications for
hypertensive control. These will be Avapro 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. as
well as Norvasc 10 mg daily. It is recommended that if the
patient has poorly controlled hypertension as an outpatient , she
will undergo a trial with an agent that has no activity at the
sinoatrial node. Our recommended agent would be doxazosin. If
the patient continues to have bradycardia related to medications
and is unable to have her hypertension controlled by medications
that do not cause bradycardia , she may need to be re-evaluated by
the electrophysiology service for placement of a pacemaker. At
this time though , there is no recommended electrophysiologic
workup remaining for the patient.
2. Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission , the patient had
a known history of diverticulosis by colonoscopy as well as
barium enema , but had no history of acute bright red blood per
rectum. She suddenly developed acute bleeding from her rectum on
the evening of November , 2005 to a volume of approximately 1.5
- 2 liters. The patient was clearly orthostatic and unable to
stand without dizziness. She had no pain with this bleeding and
had no evidence of hematemesis. The patient was transfused to a
total of four units of packed red blood cells with her hematocrit
stabilizing in the low 30s following a drop to 28.8. She was
evaluated by the Gastroenterology Service at Nawsum Medical Center Of who took the patient to colonscopy on March . She
was found on colonoscopy to have nonbleeding diverticuli as well
as evidence of fresh blood in the sigmoid colon. The diagnosis
was thus made that the patient had had a sigmoid diverticular
bleed but was currently stable hemodynamically. The patient was
also assessed by surgery who felt the patient not to be an urgent
surgical candidate but recommended nasogastric lavage if the
patient were to rebleed and further consultation with surgery in
that event. The patient was observed to be hemodynamically
stable over the remainder of her hospitalization with no evidence
of drop in blood pressure or new blood per rectum. Her
hematocrit remained stable in the range of 30 at time of
discharge. She is recommended to follow up with her primary care
physician for observation and is instructed to return to the
Emergency Department immediately if there are any signs of
gastrointestinal bleeding and either vomiting of blood or blood
in her stool. She is maintained on Nexium for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis over her course.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a known history of insulin
dependent mellitus and she was maintained on NPH insulin at a
dose of 10 units subcutaneously b.i.d. following blood sugars
which was reduced from her outpatient dose following blood sugars
in the range of 50-60 on day of admission. She was also
maintained on an insulin sliding scale. During her
hospitalization , the patient&apos;s history of refractory hypertension
was concerning for the possibility that she may have some degree
of underlying renovascular hypertension. She has subsequently
underwent a secondary hypertension workup which included an a.m.
cortisol level which was 10.8 which was in the low range of
normal. She had an aldosterone level which was 2.8 which was low
and a plasmin renin activity 0.1 which is low. She completed a
24 hour urine collection and the urine levels of cortisol
metanephrines and normetanephrines are still outstanding. It is
recommended that she follow up these levels with her outpatient
physician. As stated above , the patient&apos;s blood pressure was
well controlled on Norvasc and Avapro and on the morning of
dictation her systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg.
4. Musculoskeletal: Beginning on January , the patient began
to complain of bilateral foot cramps worse in the plantar aspect
of her foot but also on the dorsum of her foot which were
exacerbated by dorsi and plantar flexion. She also described
vague pain in her right lateral calves. She subsequently
underwent lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound studies which
demonstrated no evidence of venous clots in either of her legs.
On exam , her legs demonstrated no tenderness to palpation over
her major joints and no evidence of frank inflammation. She was
assessed to likely have plantar fasciitis on the basis of
examination. The case was discussed with Rheumatology who
recommended Tylenol as well as hot or cold packs. The patient
subsequently received these treatments with improvement of her
symptoms. At the time of discharge though she continues to have
some left foot pain and Rheumatology has been consulted to
evaluate the patient more fully. Their recommendations are
pending at time of dictation. The patient complained of
difficulty walking secondary to this bilateral foot pain and will
be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further care.
5. Infectious disease: The patient had a urinalysis at the time
of admission as well as blood cultures , both of which were
negative. Her chest x-ray at time of admission was without
infiltrate.
6. ENT: The patient was continued on her Flonase at her
outpatient dose , stable without new complaints at time of
dictation.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on Lovenox for DVT
prophylaxis which was subsequently discontinued following her
diverticular bleed. She is maintained on Nexium for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis. She will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility in stable condition.
FOLLOW UP PLAN: Follow up plan for her is with her primary care
physician , Dr. Ernzen Dr. Spulick is advised to follow the
patient&apos;s urinary cortisol as well as her 24 hour urine
metanephrines and normetanephrine levels. It is recommended that
he continue to follow his hypertension closely as he has been and
use whenever possible agents without sinoatrial nodal activity.
Recommended next agent if the patient continues to have
refractory hypertension would be doxazosin. The patient is
advised to pursue a high fiber diet in the context of her
diverticulitis and is advised to return to medical care
immediately if there are any new signs of gastrointestinal
bleeding or vomiting of blood. Again , the patient is not
assessed to be a candidate for a pacemaker at this time due to
the likely medication related bradycardia that she experienced
although she continues to have new symptomatic bradycardia. It
is recommended that she return for re-evaluation to the
Electrophysiology Service. She is recommended to follow up with
physical therapy as an inpatient at a rehabilitation facility and
then follow up with Podiatry if indicated. Please note the
patient&apos;s NPH insulin dosing was decreased from her outpatient
level from 20 to 14 units subcutaneously b.i.d. given the
patient&apos;s episodes of hypoglycemia on the day of admission during
which she was receiving 20 units subcutaneously. It is advised
that her rehabilitation facility check daily fingersticks with
meals and adjust her NPH dosing as appropriate.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Discharge medications will include Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 14 units
subcutaneously b.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily , Flonase 1-2
sprays daily , Avapro 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS and PROBLEMS:
RENAL: *worsening renal insufficiency* Pt was admitted with worsening
renal insufficiency. A UA was dirty and urine culture was sent.
Pt was not treated with antibiotics , as she was afebrile , asymptomatic ,
and without leukocytosis. Her FeBun was 35.9 , not consistent with
intravascular depletion. On exam , she appeared euvolemic.
A repeat ECHO revealed relatively unchanged systolic function.
A renal ultrasound was within normal limits. It is unclear what
caused the patient&apos;s vacillation in renal function. She likely has
a narrow range with respect to ideal volume status. She was continued on her
home torsemide dose while in house. Her weight on discharge was 72.5 kg ( 159
lbs ) , very close to her admission weight of 72.7 kg and to her designated dry
weight of 159 lbs. Her creatinine improved on its own from 2.7 on admission
to 1.9 on the day of discharge. 1.9 represents a value within her
baselne creatinine range of 1.8 to 2.2. She will need close follow up of
her renal function
*hyperkalemia* Pt presented with hyperkalemia in setting of worsening renal
insufficiency. Her peak creatinine was 5.5. She recevied kayex on the day of
admission. Subsequent creatinine measurements were in the 4&apos;s without
k-binding treatment on the one hand or K supplementation on the other.
Pt. had been on k supplementation at home. Her oral supplements are being
held on discharge. She will need close follow up of her potassium and
may need to resume supplementation on an outpatient basis.
CV:
*CAD s/p multiple PCI* Pt was continued on ASA , bb , statin. She was
also started on low dose isordil. Her BP will need close monitoring on this
new medication.
*BP* Pt was continued on bb and started on isordil , as above.
On the day of discharge , her standing SBP dropped to 92 from 118 sitting.
Her HR remained in the 70s. She was asymptomatic. In light of these changes ,
she was discharged on torsemide 40 mg PO bid , lower than her home dose and
in-hospital dose of 60 mg pO bid. She was instructed not to walk without
supervision and to stand up slowly from seated position.
*CHF* Pt was thought to be clinically euvolemic on exam. Her BNP was in the
800s. Her repeat ECHo showed an EF of 30% , relatively unchanged from
previous ECHO 3/24 She was continued on her home torsemide dose while in
house and discharged on a lower dose of torsemide as described above.
*MVR* Stable.
*afib* Pt was rate controlled with bb. Her INR was subtherapeutic on
admission. In light of this , her coumadin dose was increased from 1 to 2
while in house. Her INR rose to 1.9 on discharge. Her coumadin dose was
downgraded to 1. She will need close follow up of her INR.
HEME:
*iron deficiency anemia* Pt. was continued on iron. Colonoscopy could
be considered but may not be indicated given pt.&apos;s prognosis from known
lung malignancy.
ONC:
*lung CA* Pt has CXR findings likely related to her known
malignancy. She will f/u with her outpatient oncologist.
PULM:
*o2 requirement* Pt was noted to desat to 87% while ambulating.
Home O2 was arranged. Etiology of pt.&apos;s new oxygen requirement likely
relates to underlying lung malignancy , and perhaps to her CHF - although
she appears compensated from that standpoint.
ENDO: *DM* Pt was treated with SSI while in house and was discharged on
her home glipizide. She was continued on her home levoxyl.
RHEUM: *gout* Pt was continued on her prophylactic allopurinol.
PROPH: nexium/coumadin
****DISCHARGE STATUS: On discharge , pt. is afebrile , P 70s SBP 90s-110s
satting 95% 2L. Exam unchanged from admission. hct 31 , Cr 1.9 , INR 1.9
****DISPOSITION: Pt is being discharged to home with VNA services
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: TO PT:
-You were admitted with worsening kidney function. An ultrasound of your
kidneys was normal and your kidney function improved.
-During this hospitalization , we added a new medication called isordil 5
mg three times per day. We decreased your dose of torsemide to 40 mg
two times per day. In addition , we stopped your medication
called potassium. You will have your potassium levels checked and your
outpatient physicians will decide on whether you need to restart potassium
and at what level.
-We arranged for you to have home oxygen. Use it while sleeping and
when you feel short of breath. Do not smoke or cook on the stove while
using oxygen. Stay away from open flames.
-Do not stand up quickly from a seated position and do not
walk without supervision. We noticed your blood pressure is lower
when you stand and we do not want you to get dizzy and fall , especially as
you are on coumadin. Do not drive.
-Return to the emergency room or call your doctor if you have increasing
shortness of breath , weight gain , chest pressure or jaw pain , dizziness ,
lightheadedness , palpitations , abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea.
-Take prescription for blood draw to HHO on 11/25 Have INR , chem 7 , and
magnesium checked. As per script , results should be faxed both to Dr. Sterling Guandique fax 404-329-6993 and to Dr. Jospeh Olaya tel 051-469-9935
To VNA:
-monitor O2 sat on home O2
- do heart rate and blood pressure check
- check weight - notify Dr. Robert Avenoso 051-469-9935 if weight
increases or decreases by 2 pounds in 3 days
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
PCP/cards:
-Monitor creatinine. Pt.&apos;s creatinine improved from 2.7 to 1.9. Baseline
1.8-2.2 in past. FeBUN was 35.9% and BUN/Cr ratio was 20. We continued
torsemide 60mg po bid. Renal ultrasound was normal bilaterally.
-Monitor potassium. Pt.&apos;s K decreased from 5.5 to 4.1. She did not
require potassium supplementation while in the hospital. Her outpatient
dose of potassium was held. This may need to be restarted if her potassium
decreases below 4.
-F/u official results of urine culture , send secondary to dirty UA.
Pt not treated as afebrile , asymptomatic , nl wbc count.
-Monitor hct - stable in low 30s. Pt has known iron deficiency anemia
and is on iron.
-Monitor INR on coumadin. Goal INR is 2-3. Pt had been on 1 mg PO qd
coumadin at home. Her INR on admission was 1.5. She was treated with
coumadin 2 mg PO qd. Her INR rose to 1.9 on the day of discharge. She was
discharged again on coumadin 1 mg PO qd. VNA should draw her INR on 4/29
and fax results to her PCP.
-Monitor blood pressure on isordil. On low dose 5mg po tid currently.
-Monitor SOB on home o2. Pt. desatted to 87% while ambulating on RA. Her
subjective shortness of breath improves tremendously on 2L. PET scan
suggests progressive lung CA.
-Patient is DNR/DNI and her healthcare proxy is her husband.

Discharge Date: 6/6/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Atrial flutter.
PROBLEMS: Coronary artery disease. New atrial fibrillation..
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Tarboro is a 50 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary
artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft
( CABG ) performed at Hilltans Spizee Memorial Medical Center two weeks prior to
his admission. He presents with three days of palpitations. On
18 of June , Mr. Almgren underwent cardiac catheterization which showed
100% occlusion of the proximal LAD and 70% occlusion of the
circumflex. He subsequently had a two vessel CABG at Healtsa Men&apos;sas Health Center with attachment of the LIMA to the LAD and the left
radial artery to the circumflex. Postoperatively he went into
atrial fibrillation which later converted to normal sinus rhythm ,
and he was discharged in stable condition on 24 of August on a medical
regimen of aspirin 325 mg q day , diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. to prevent
vasospasm of radial artery , Atenolol 25 b.i.d. Three days prior to
this admission , the patient noted palpitations of his heart with
fluttering of the neck associated with clamminess and diaphoresis.
He felt no chest pain , no nausea , vomiting , or shortness of breath ,
but VNA noted that his 150 beats per minute. The patient presented
to the Navail Hospital emergency room on 10 of June where EKG showed
him to be in atrial fibrillation alternating with atrial flutter
with a two-to-one block. An echocardiogram performed in the
emergency room showed an ejection fraction of 54% with a mild
pericardial effusion. By report from Ties Hospital , the
patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. He was sent home on his
previous medical regimen of Atenolol and aspirin with an increased
dose of diltiazem to 60 t.i.d. The patient felt well on discharge
with no chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , and no
syncope. Laboratory studies in the Lukes Loton Health Services emergency room showed
low CK of 31 with troponin of 0.3 , magnesium 2.4. On the morning
of admission , 17 of May , the patient noted palpitations again with a
rapid heart rate to 140 to 150. He presented to the Pack General Hospital emergency room. As previously , the patient denied
associated symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea ,
vomiting , abdominal pain , back pain , PND , or orthopnea.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 325 mg q day. Diltiazem 60 mg
t.i.d. Atenolol 25 mg b.i.d. Percocet
one to two q day p.r.n. pain. Pravachol 40 mg q hs.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a former medical assistant who
lives with his wife. He has a four to five pack
year smoking history having quit 25 years ago and drinks occasional
alcohol. No intravenous drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for an uncle who died of myocardial
infarction at an early age.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.1 F , heart rate 130 to 140
regular , blood pressure 108/74 , respiratory
rate 16. O2 saturation 96% on room air. The patient was an obese
Caucasian male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam revealed pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles intact.
Oropharynx clear with no exudate or erythema. Neck supple with no
cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy , no thyroid
enlargement. Chest - full , symmetric expansion. Clear to
auscultation with no rales or wheezes. Well healed sternal
surgical scar. Cardiovascular exam - jugular venous pressure at 8
cm. Normal S1 and S2. Rhythm irregularly irregular. No murmur ,
S3 , or S4. Carotid pulses 2+ bilaterally , no bruits. Abdominal
exam , soft , nontender , nondistended , no organomegaly , plus bowel
sounds. Extremities , no cyanosis , edema , or tenderness , warm and
well perfused with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurological exam , alert and oriented X3. Cranial nerves II
through XII intact. Motor and sensory exam normal with 2+ patellar
reflexes , toes down going.
LABORATORY: On admission showed sodium 142 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 102 , CO2 26 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose
104. White blood cell count 6.68 , hematocrit 31.0 , platelets 299.
18% lymphocytes , 71.8% neutrophils. PT 12.9 , INR 1.2 , PTT 24.4.
CK on admission 28. CT 0.08.
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion but no evidence of
congestive heart failure or infiltrate.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 130 beats per minute. Normal
axis with Q waves in 3 , AVF , V1 through V4. Unchanged from
previous EKG.
Calcium 8.7 with an albumin of 3.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with a medical regimen on
admission of increased Atenolol to 50 b.i.d. ,
continued diltiazem at 30 mg t.i.d. , continued aspirin. Was loaded
with heparin bolus of 5000 , and loaded with procainamide at a rate
of 750 mg q 6 hours. Despite loading with procainamide for a total
of 5.25 grams over 36 hours , the patient maintained rhythm of
atrial flutter with two to one block throughout his hospital course
with occasional variable conduction of three to one block
alternating with two to one block , occasional breaks to atrial
fibrillation. An echocardiogram was performed in hospital on
27 of February which showed an ejection fraction of 30% decreased from 45%
on his last Contisifoundt.warne Kett Hospital echocardiogram dated October , 1999.
The echocardiogram from 27 of February also showed left ventricle normal
in size with moderate concentric LVH , reduced LV function , left
atrium enlargement , with no evidence of thrombus. Normal valves
with a small pericardial effusion. Other causes for atrial
fibrillation were considered. TSH came back normal at 3.1. New
onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was felt to be
consistent with pericardial inflammation post surgery. The patient
was maintained on procainamide throughout duration of stay. Dose
was increased on 16 of November to procainamide SR 1000 mg q.i.d.
However , this attempt at pharmacological cardioversion did not
succeed in attaining normal sinus rhythm. The patient was
presented with option of two to three weeks anticoagulation as an
out patient with rate control on Atenolol and diltiazem to be
followed by elective DC cardioversion at the end of three weeks.
Also discussed was the option of performing a transesophageal echo
followed by in house DC cardioversion. The patient and Dr.
Pulkrabek chose the first option. The patient was started on
Coumadin and attained INR of 1.7 by the day of discharge , 8 of May
Although patient had maintained atrial flutter rhythm throughout
hospital stay , hemodynamically had been stable with pulse ranging
between 76 to 110 with occasional tachycardia during activity and
during the morning hours ranging from 120 to 130. Blood pressure
ranged between 90 to 110 systolic pressure. There was a
significant concern regarding the patient&apos;s decreased ejection
fraction to 30% from preoperative 45% , felt to be possibly
secondary to negative inotropic medications as well as atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However , could not
rule out possibility of new infarct or ischemia causing decreased
LV function. In addition to his previous medications , the patient
was discharged on Digoxin .25 mg q day and with instructions to
follow up with Dr. Riherd regarding his dose of procainamide
as well as the possibility of adding a low dose ace inhibitor.
Patient will be followed by VNA Services and by Anticoagulation
Service managed by Keith Foy for INR monitoring and will return
to Ertri Brown Memorial Hospital in two to three weeks for elective DC
cardioversion.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg q day. Atenolol 50 mg
b.i.d. Diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d.
Procainamide SR 1000 mg q.i.d. Coumadin 5 mg q hs. Pravachol 40
mg q hs. Digoxin 0.25 mg q day. Colace 100 mg q day. Captopril
12.5 mg q day to be filled only on specific instructions by Dr.
Bojko
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Scroggy on
Monday , 8 of April , by phone regarding medication changes
and will return to Inhunt Memorial Medical in two to three weeks
for DC cardioversion.
The patient and his wife will continue to monitor heart rate and
blood pressure with home blood pressure cuff to follow vital signs
and have been instructed to call Dr. Wainkrantz if heart rate
exceeds 140 beats per minute or if patient experiences symptoms of
chest pain , shortness of breath , or increased palpitations , as well
as sign of blood in stools or excessive bruising.
The patient was discharged to home with VNA services in stable
condition.

Discharge Date: 4/16/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: NON Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53-year-old woman with mild
mental retardation , schizophrenia , and
borderline diabetes mellitus who was transferred from Himend Richdent Health Services for further cardiac evaluation after a non Q wave
myocardial infarction. She was in her usual state of health until
August 1995 when her family reports she began to have
intermittent abdominal pain and shortness of breath. It continued
to worsen until October 1996 when she presented to her primary
medical doctor and was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection
and treated with antibiotics and Theo-Dur. At that time , the
family noticed she had an increasing shortness of breath , lethargy ,
and now significant weight gain. They reported about 35 lb per
week. On the date of admission to the Limen Hospital , she was
ambulating , but became extremely short of breath with severe
abdominal pain. They took her to the hospital and she was admitted
for what they thought was primary gastrointestinal process , but
they noted increasing GGTs without alkaline phosphatase changes in
her laboratory panel. She was placed on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol and subsequently ruled in for a non Q wave
myocardial infarction with CKs of 235 , 6.3% , 246 , 7.7% MBs and 197 ,
7.6% MBs. Her EKG showed anterolateral myocardial
infarction/ischemic myocardial infarction. Her echo at Woodnaw Medical Center showed decreased LV function per report. Since admission
there , she had had repeated episodes of chest pain/abdominal
discomfort from 7/11/96 to 5/25/96 , and she was transferred to
the Middvail Fredhot Hospital for further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mild mental retardation , schizophrenia ,
borderline diabetes mellitus , and morbid
obesity.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient has had a history of thyroid problems
in her family. She has a history of coronary
artery disease in her family. She lives with her sister. Her
daughters are in the area. Her cardiac risk factors include family
history , borderline hypertension. She does not smoke or drink.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese woman in no obvious
distress. The patient had dry mucous
membranes. Her neck and JVP were difficult to assess secondary to
body habitus. She had a left IJ catheter in place. She had
distant heart sounds without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Lungs had
crackles 1/4 of the way up bilaterally. Abdomen was markedly obese
with a right upper quadrant tenderness to deep palpation. She had
edema from her feet up to her abdominal canis. She had 4+ edema to
her hips. There were 2+ pulses DP and PT. Femoral pulses were
difficult to assess. The patient was alert and oriented times
three and able to understand questions , but she had decreased
verbal skills.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-20 and CBC were within normal range. Her
LDH was slightly elevated at 419 , alkaline
phosphatase elevated at 746. Total protein was decreased at 6.4 ,
albumin decreased at 3.6. Her digoxin level was 0.4. She was on
heparin with a PTT of 58.8. EKG showed a sinus rhythm of 89 , poor
R wave progression , old ischemic myocardial infarction , T wave
inversions in 1 , L , and V5-V6. Chest x-ray , by report from Noxer Kingsnew Tesbucks Health Of , showed mild cardiomegaly , pulmonary venous
hypertension , elevated right hemidiaphragm.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On transfer , the patient was evaluated with an
echocardiogram which showed global hypokinesis
with an ejection fraction of 20% and severely dilated heart.
Cardiac catheterization was contemplated to rule out ischemia as
her source of cardiomyopathy , but given that catheterization would
likely require intubation secondary to sedation given her psych
issues , the decision was made to pursue a more conservative course
with treatment of medication. She was aggressively treated for
congestive heart failure with digoxin , Ace inhibitor , and IV Lasix
and she continued to get IV Lasix b.i.d. 40 mg. She remained
stable while in the hospital and , after several days of diuresis ,
her edema slowly improved. Her breathing improved and she began to
ambulate. She lost approximately 8 kg while in hospital.
Her second issue was gastrointestinal. She continued to have , on
admission , an elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase in the absence
of significant transaminases , it was not consistent with passive
congestion alone. We continued to follow them and they eventually
drifted down. The source of her elevations were never clear. We
checked the ammonia level which was normal and a sedimentation rate
which was normal.
Her third issue was Infectious Disease. Her urine , by report at
Ymont Taplaeast Hospital , had greater than 10-15 E.coli. She was not
treated with antibiotics. We repeated the urinalysis here and
began ampicillin on p.o. for a urinary tract infection , which she
continued for a full 10 day course. They felt that her urinary
tract infection was secondary to limited ambulation and her body
habitus.
The fourth issue was fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition. She had
total body edema and anasarca with slightly decreased protein and
albumin , but most likely secondary to severe congestive heart
failure. Her mucous membranes were dry , but felt this was
secondary to her breathing and possible intervascular depletion.
All of these issues cleared as she was diuresed.
The fifth issue was psych. We continued her medications and
contacted her family for support while she was in the hospital.
The patient did well and once she was able to walk around with
physical therapy , she was discharged on Lasix , digoxin , and with
VNA.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Elavil 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , aspirin ECASA

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75 year old female ,
with a history of coronary artery
disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and diabetes , who
presented with chest tightness and a nonproductive cough. The
patient basically complained of a two to three day history of
cough , congestion , and wheezing. She had a productive cough
productive of white clear sputum. The patient also stated that her
respirations were accompanied by chest tightness , different from
her angina equivalent. The patient denied fevers , chills , night
sweats , or dizziness. She had no diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting.
The patient initially presented to Lomont Memorial Hospital where chest
x-ray was clear , without evidence of infiltrate. The patient was
transferred to Daballginor Is Valley Medical Center Emergency Department for
further evaluation. In the Emergency Department at WDUH , it was
felt that the patient deserved admission to the Short Stay Unit for
very mild congestive heart failure exacerbation and bronchospastic
episode. The patient was given one dose of Solu-Medrol 80 mg
intravenously and transferred up on Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers. Of note , the patient had a history of increased
glucose intolerance on steroids. She also had pulmonary function
tests on 10 of February which demonstrated an FEV1 of 1.27 which was 69%
of predicted and an FVC of 1.75 which was 75% of predicted.
Echocardiogram in September 1994 demonstrated mild to moderate decreased
left ventricular function with regional wall motion abnormality
consistent with her old apical septal and inferobasilar infarcts.
Ejection fraction at that time was 45%. The patient had previously
been treated with Biaxin and then switched to Augmentin in the
Short Stay Unit for treatment of possible bronchitis. Other issues
in the Short Stay Unit were a question of an infection of the left
great toe with a history of diabetes. The patient was transferred
to Ri on 6 of February in stable condition.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) History of congestive heart failure.
2 ) Coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass graft in 1994 , LIMA to LAD and an SVG graft

6 ) Asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 7 ) Status post
bilateral total knee replacements. 8 ) Status post
parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism. 9 ) Chronic renal
insufficiency. 10 ) Status post brown tumor excision of the right
radius. 11 ) Constipation. 12 ) Rectocele repair in February 1997.
13 ) Cataracts.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Bactrim which causes rash.

1%.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and grown
children in Harsaport The patient denied tobacco
or ethanol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this was an elderly female
sitting in a chair in no apparent distress.
Vital signs included temperature of 97.1 , heart rate 84 , blood
pressure 128/78 , and breathing of 99% on 3 liters. HEENT: Pupils
were equal , round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements
were intact. Moist mucous membranes were noted. Oropharynx was
clear , without lesions. Neck had 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally
without bruits. Jugular venous pressure was estimated at
approximately 5 cm. Lungs had a few end expiratory wheezes
bilaterally at the bases. Heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2 and no rubs , gallops , or murmurs. Abdominal
exam was soft , with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended ,
with no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities demonstrated 1+ peripheral
pulses bilaterally. Status post bilateral total knee replacement
scars were notable. There were 1+ femoral pulses. She had a left
great toe with tenderness and erythema. No lymphangitic changes
were appreciated.
LABS ON TRANSFER: Sodium was 137 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 23 , BUN 49 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose
129. Iron was 76 , ferritin 236. White count was 16.5 , hematocrit
33.3 , and platelets 255 , with an MCV of 89.7. Chest x-ray
demonstrated elevated left hemidiaphragm with minimal atelectasis
at the left base. Lungs were clear. She was status post coronary
artery bypass grafting. Pulmonary vasculature was normal. She had
notable degenerative joint disease of the thoracic spine. There
was no evidence of acute disease. ECG demonstrated normal sinus
rhythm at 70 beats per minute with left atrial enlargement , poor R
wave progression , old Q&apos;s in 3 , and no acute ST-T wave changes.
ASSESSMENT: The assessment for this woman was an acute chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease/bronchospastic airway
disease exacerbation , as well as left great toe infection.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Pulmonary: The patient was initially admitted
on 21 of September to the Short Stay Unit as stated in
the history of present illness and received one dose of Solu-Medrol
intravenously in the Emergency Department and then started on
Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. She was also placed on Atrovent and
Albuterol nebulizers. The patient noted slow improvement in
symptoms , as well as peak flows. Peak flow initially on admission
was around 200 and on transfer from the Short Stay Unit was about
250. Once the patient was transferred to the floor , she had noted
significant improvement , requiring decreased 02 , essentially to
require no 02 on 11 of April with an 02 saturation of 96%. The
patient was changed to metered dose inhalers with Aerochamber on
11 of April which consisted of Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , Vanceril
four puffs b.i.d. , and Albuterol two puffs q.i.d. , with noted
improvement. The patient was also continued on 40 mg of Prednisone
p.o. q.d. , as well as Augmentin for question of bronchitis. On
26 of July the patient was found to have slight scattered end
expiratory wheezes , however , was moving good air. It was decided
to discharge the patient from a pulmonary standpoint on Vanceril
four puffs b.i.d. , Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , and Albuterol two
puffs q.i.d. for seven days , then p.r.n. The patient&apos;s peak flow
on the day of discharge was approximately 250 as well , however ,
notable symptomatic improvement was achieved. The patient is to
follow-up with Dr. Ledee in one week.
2 ) Left great toe cellulitis. An infectious disease consult was
obtained , and it was felt that bone films would be in order to rule
out any evidence of chronic osteomyelitis as well as to continue
on Augmentin 250 mg t.i.d. Bone films were obtained which were
negative for any evidence of chronic osteomyelitis. Subsequently ,
ESR was checked which was elevated at 73. As well , a bone scan
obtained to rule out chronic osteomyelitis of the left great toe ,
the results of which on the preliminary reading were as follows.
The right foot was diffusely hyperemic. The left foot potentially
could be underperfused in relation to the right foot secondary to
diabetic vascular changes. On the delayed images , the right second
proximal phalanx had a slight prominence. The left second
metatarsophalangeal joint had a slight prominence. She also
demonstrated an abnormal right mid foot at the proximal
metatarsophalangeal joints of the medial three metatarsals ,
possibly consistent with neuropathic joint. There was also a
prominence of bilateral tibial components of the knees which could
be suggestive of prosthetic loosening , however , this was not
confirmed by clinical exam. In essence , there was no evidence of
chronic osteomyelitic changes. Therefore , it was decided to
continue a total of a 14 day course of Augmentin 250 mg t.i.d.
for this issue. If symptoms were to worsen or not improve fully ,
the patient is to follow-up again with her primary medical doctors ,
Dr. Tomkus or Dr. Lesesne , as well as potentially setting her up in
the Infectious Disease Clinic for further follow-up.
3 ) Miscellaneous. As to the remainder of her medical issues , the
patient was maintained on her home medications and demonstrated no
issues. Therefore , the patient was discharged on 26 of July in
stable condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to make an appointment and follow-up
with Dr. Alls for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease/asthma flare. She is also to follow-up with Dr. Liddicoat in
three weeks to one month for her endocrinologic issues. VNA will
check glucose measurements twice a week , the results of which are
to be called in to her endocrinologist.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Augmentin 250 mg p.o. t.i.d. with food
times 11 more days , enteric coated aspirin
81 mg q.d. , calcium carbonate 625 mg q.d. , Cardizem CD 300 mg per

Discharge Date: 5/23/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Four vessel coronary artery bypass graft.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old woman
with a history of chronic renal
failure , hypertension , diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity with a
long history of coronary artery disease and angina. The patient
presented to the hospital with recurrent chest tightness with
radiation to her left arm associated with shortness of breath ,
nausea , vomiting and headache. The patient had similar episodes in
the same prior to presentation. These are not associated with
exercise which was new for her.
In the emergency room the patient received aspirin and nitro-paste
along with beta blockers. Her EKG at that time demonstrated 2 to 3
mm ST depressions in her lateral leads. CK at that time was 634
with an MB of 30. Her troponin I came back at 12.8. The patient
was admitted at that time with a diagnosis of nonQ-wave myocardial
infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension. Morbid obesity. Cataract
surgery. Coronary artery disease. Angina ( As above ).
MEDICATIONS: Hytrin 20 mg q.h.s. , Humulin NPH 175 mg q. a.m. ,
45 q. p.m. , Regular 45 q. a.m. , 10 q. p.m. ,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d. , Micronase 10 mg b.i.d. , Verapamil SR 240 mg
b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a morbidly obese woman in no
apparent distress. Blood pressure 142/74 ,
pulse 78 , respiratory rate 20 , temperature 99.9 , sats are 97% on
four liters. HEAD , EYES , EARS , NOSE AND THROAT: No dental
pathology. Oropharynx is clear. Sclerae are anicteric. Neck -
Supple with full range of motion. There is no jugular venous
distention. No carotid bruits. Cardiac - Revealed a regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with minimal crackles
at the bases. Abdomen - Benign with positive bowel sounds and no
masses identified. Extremities - Without edema and without venous
varicosities. Distal pulses were 2+ bilaterally. Neurological -
Nonfocal. Rectal - Guaiac negative.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission - Significant for a glucose elevated
at 211 , but otherwise normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and ruled in for nonQ-wave myocardial
infarction. She underwent cardiac catheterization 7 of February where a
100% proximal dominant circumflex artery stenosis was noted along
with 60% proximal LAD and 80% RCA stenosis.
The patient underwent PCA of her circumflex which at that time was
not successful. Postoperatively she did well , but had persistent
chest pain. She did underwent cardiac catheterization 27 of June
which revealed 40% residual stenosis of the dominant left
circumflex. At that time , coronary steps were placed. The patient
however , continued to experience substernal chest pain and dyspnea
over the ensuing days. The patient also experienced flash
pulmonary edema and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit. At
that time it was decided that her attempts at angioplasty were
unsuccessful. She was evaluated for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
She was taken to the operating room on 3 of September where she underwent
four vessel bypass ( LIMA to LAD , saphenous vein graft to R1 and
then jumped to OM and lastly saphenous vein graft to PDA ). She
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit. She was maintained on triple antibiotics to
cover the potential sequela of a superficial cordis site skin
infection. Sputum sent from postoperative day #1 demonstrated
Pseudomonas in her sputum. Chest x-ray showed the evolution of a
right basilar consolidation. She was placed on ofloxacin and
piperacillin to cover the Pseudomonas. She was slow to extubate
but ultimately did on 18 of May The rest of her postoperative course
was significant for steady wean of her oxygen requirement with
concomitant aggressive diuresis. She was covered with ofloxacin
and piperacillin throughout the rest of her hospital course with
resolution of her right lower lobe pneumonia demonstrated on chest
x-ray. She experienced no further substernal chest pain during her
hospitalization.
In the immediate postoperative period , she did experience some
confusion but this resolved spontaneously and her neurological exam
was completely nonfocal.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was their
assessment that she was somewhat unable and given her living
situation , she was recommended for rehabilitation.
Additionally , her leg wounds and her chest wound have continued to
drain somewhat throughout the hospital course. There is no
apparent evidence of significant infection in either site. If some
minor infection were to develop , it should be covered adequately
with the ofloxacin or piperacillin that she is currently taking.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin NPH 60
units in the morning , 20 units in the evening , lisinopril 10 mg
q.d. , Percocet 1-2 tabs p.o. q3-4h , Verapamil 80 mg t.i.d. ,
piperacillin 3 grams IV q4h for an additional four days from the
time of discharge. Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for an additional
four days , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Albuterol inhalers two
puffs t.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing.
DIET: Low fat ADA diet , 1800 calories a day.
ACTIVITIES: As tolerated.
FOLLOW-UP: Dr. Feeney in four weeks , cardiologist in one week.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: To rehabilitation.

Discharge Date: 7/26/1997
SERVICE: Walk Verlsa Tempeh
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: None.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient was admitted with a one month history
of increasing shortness of breath , decrease in
exercise tolerance , and two week history of indigestion , diarrhea ,
and mild abdominal discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Vergara is a 29 year old
gentleman with familial cardiomyopathy
diagnosed at age 18. Cardiac catheterization in 1987 revealed a
PCWP 13 , CI 3.8 , no coronary artery disease or valvular problems ,
and a moderately enlarged diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle , EF
31%. , RA 8 , PA 27/12 , SVR 779. Approximately four to six years
ago , he began having increased shortness of breath and was started
on digoxin , Lasix , and Vasotec at that time. A follow-up echo in
1993 revealed an EF of 25% to 30% with moderate dilation of all
four heart chambers , left atrial size of 4.2 with 2+ TR and 3+ MR.
ETT on August 1994 was 9 minutes and 4 seconds in duration
revealing only nonspecific 1 mm ST depression , V4 through V6 , and
MV O2 of 17.0 ml/min/kg. He continued on his medical regimen until three
months prior to this hospital admission when he began to lose
weight ( approximately 35 lbs. at this time by the patient&apos;s
report ) , and one month ago , he noticed that he was increasingly
short of breath. He has two pillow orthopnea which has not
changed. He has occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
occasional palpitations. He denies any chest pain or peripheral
edema. He also notes that his exercise tolerance has been greatly
decreased. His Lasix dose was increased recently in clinic as
well. Furthermore , beginning approximately two weeks prior to
admission , he began to complain of indigestion , diarrhea ,
intermittent nausea and vomiting , and abdominal pain. He has had
multiple watery brown stools each day without hematochezia , melena
or fevers. He presented to the Emergency Department four days
prior to admission with these complaints with negative workup at
that time. Most recent Echo on October revealed EF at 24%
with global decreased function , 3+ TR , 4+ MR , left atrial size 5.7 ,
right ventricular enlargement with peak RV pressure greater than
58 , and no thrombus. Last ETT on 5/25 was 7 minutes and 31 seconds
in duration. MV O2 of 15.9 with peak uptake above the anaerobic
threshold.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , also status post appendectomy and
tonsillectomy in the past.
MEDICATIONS: Vasotec 5 q. day; Lasix 80 mg q. day: digoxin 0.25 mg
q. day.
ALLERGIES: NKDA.
HABITS: Occasional ETOH on weekends , approximately three to four
beers. Positive tobacco use approximately one pack per
day times ten years which he reports to have stopped two weeks ago.
Also history of marijuana use which he has stopped two weeks ago.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a mother , sister , brother , and
numerous other relatives with cardiomyopathy.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a thin white male in no acute
distress. Blood pressure 108/80 , pulse 89
and regular , respirations 22 , temperature 99.3. O2 sat 95% on room
air. Weight 70.5 kg. HEENT: Benign. NECK: CVP is 10 cm;
however pulses are 2+ without bruit. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. HEART: Notable for regular rate and rhythm; III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla; S3 and S4 present;
apical end pulses inferolaterally displaced and enlarged. ABDOMEN:
Palpable pulsatile liver which is 3 cm below the costal margin ,
nontender. Abdomen is nontender , nondistended with good bowel
sounds present. No splenomegaly. EXTREMITIES: No edema present.
Extremities warm and dry with 2+ pulses bilaterally. Tinea
infection present in the axilla and groin. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and
oriented time three. Cranial nerves III-XII were grossly intact.
Motor strength was 5/5 throughout. Toes are downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 99 ,
bicarbonate of 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1 ,
glucose 91 , ALT 249 , AST 140 , LDH 228 , alk phos 48 , total bilirubin 1.2 ,
direct bilirubin 0.6. White blood cell count 5.4 , hematocrit 35.2 ,
platelets 186. Albumin 3.2 , uric acid 10.3. EKG is normal sinus
rhythm at 97. No ST changes or Q waves present. Positive LVH.
Chest x-ray was without edema or infiltrate. Cardiomegaly is
present. Enlarged pulmonary arteries. Cardiac catheterization
revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 28 , pulmonary artery
70/30 , RV 70/8 , right atrium 12 , mixed venous saturation 45% , SVC
saturation 95%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Following cardiac catheterization , Mr. Estevane
was admitted for tailored therapy , and was
started on nitroprusside in addition to IV diuresis with Lasix ,
Captopril , and Isordil. Digoxin was continued , and he was sodium
and fluid restricted. He was also admitted for a transplant
evaluation. As part of his workup , hepatitis serologies were sent ,
as well as out of concern for his elevated LFTs. These were
negative , except for a borderline hepatitis B antibody. LFTs
gradually decreased throughout his hospitalization , and were likely
elevated due to passive congestion due to heart failure. Also
alcohol use is possible but less likely due to the pattern of
elevated LFTs.
By the next day following nitroprusside therapy overnight , his SVR
had decreased to 1000 with cardiac output of 4.71 , CVP was
decreased to 9 , and he had significant diuresis as further
evidenced by his weight loss. Captopril and Isordil doses were
increased while weaning nitroprusside for a goal systolic blood
pressure greater than 80 to 90 and SVR less than 1200. His GI
complaints resolved immediately upon admission. He had no further
episodes of diarrhea , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting. Thus , no
further workup was done at this time. Of note , he was on Fannie
Rippel protocol and was randomized to hemodynamic therapy.
Captopril was increased to final dose of 50 mg q.i.d. with Isordil
increased to 20 mg t.i.d. Nitroprusside was weaned off on 1/16/97.
IV Lasix was switched to p.o. on 1/16/97.
By 10/15/97 , he continued to feel very well without any complaints
of dyspnea on exertion , light-headedness , dizziness , or shortness
of breath. He did begin to complain of cough , possibly productive
of clear sputum , beginning on this day. He did have one episode of
a four beat run of asymptomatic nonsustained V-tach which was
well-tolerated.
On January , he had a repeat ETT which he completed in 5 minutes and 40
seconds. It was stopped secondary to leg fatigue with a max heart of 132.
EKG was without changes on exercise. Peak V. O2 of 14.3 and without ischemia.
Lasix dose was optimized with final dose of 40 mg p.o. Cough continued , and a
chest x-ray was obtained which was negative for infiltrate. Sputum was sent
and was also negative. He felt that the symptom might be due to post nasal
drip which he has had in the past , and this symptom will have to be followed.
As part of his transplant workup , an abdominal ultrasound was negative ,
although of note , his gallbladder could not be optimally visualized due to a
contraction of the gallbladder. A repeat ETT was as mentioned above.
Echocardiogram revealed LV dilatation with severe LV dysfunction , EF 15% ,
global hypokinesis , right ventricular dilatation with mild-to-moderate
dysfunction , left atrial enlargement , 3+ MR , 2+ TR with a peak velocity of 3.2
consistent with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 40 mm greater than right
atrial pressure. Pulmonary function tests revealed SVC of 3.35 , 67% ( FEV1 of
2.78 , 67% ) , FEV1/FVC of 83% , FEF 25-75 68% , FVL CO corrected 85% as predicted.
Hepatitis studies , as mentioned above. CMV: IgG positive , IgM negative. EBV:
IgG positive , IgM negative. Mumps positive , VZV positive. Toxoplasma IgG
borderline , low positive; IgM negative. PPD with mumps and Candida control
were placed on 9/20/97 , and the patient was to return to the hospital on
8/16/97 to be examined.
By May , 1997 , the patient was feeling extremely well , and
ambulating without difficulty. He had improved energy and
appetite , and was afebrile. He denied any shortness of breath ,
chest pains , palpitations , and was felt to be stable for discharge.
PROCEDURES: He underwent an echocardiogram on 9/20/97 , ETT
9/20/97 , abdominal ultrasound 9/20/97 , pulmonary
function test 11/3/97 , cardiac catheterization 4/28/97.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Isordil 20 mg
p.o. t.i.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day with
instructions that if his weight increased by three to four pounds ,
he should take 80 mg of Lasix that day; Lotrimin 1% cream topical
b.i.d.; and digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.
DIET: He was also discharged on a 2 gram sodium diet with 2 liter

Discharge Date: 7/15/2005
ATTENDING: KRAWIECZ , GRANVILLE BILL MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and
angioplasty in 1991. However , he had no history of myocardial
infarction or congestive heart failure. The patient&apos;s history
also is notable for severe depression and anxiety. He had been
fine with medical management of his coronary artery disease until
three to four months prior to admission when he began feeling
tightness in the chest and midsternal chest pain on admission. A
stress test performed in October showed abnormalities in the septal
and apical segments and an ejection fraction of 60%. During the
last several months , the patient experienced increasing frequency
of his anginal episodes and on 11/4/05 he was admitted to
Rissa H/bar Medical Center because of complaints of chest pain
and high blood pressure up to 230/130. The patient did
experience relief with sublingual nitroglycerin. His EKG showed
changes positive for ischemia and a troponin leak of 0.15. He
was scheduled for cardiac catheterization performed on 9/23/05 ,
which revealed left main coronary artery stenosis , LAD stenosis ,
and a long RCA stenosis. The patient was then referred for
surgical revascularization of his coronary arteries.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus treated
with diet , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , asthma , ruptured disk x2
at age 20 , GERD , depression with three recent hospitalizations.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right breast biopsy 14 years ago revealed
to be benign.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies tobacco use.
ALLERGIES: To beestings. Penicillin causes a rash and Demerol
causes dizziness.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg daily , lisinopril 30 mg
daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , Nexium 40 mg daily , Cymbalta 80 mg
daily , Seroquel 100 mg daily.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Height 5 feet 8 inches , weight 7.05 kg. Vital
signs , temperature 96 degrees , heart rate 77 , O2 saturation 98%.
HEENT , PERRLA , dentition without evidence of infection , no
carotid bruits. Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , no
murmurs. Respiratory , breath sounds clear bilaterally. Abdomen ,
no incisions. Extremities , without scarring , varicosities or
edema. Neuro , alert and oriented , no focal deficits. Pulses 2+
bilaterally throughout. Allen&apos;s test of the right and left upper
extremity revealed normal.
PREOPERATIVE LAB: Sodium 133 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 100 ,
bicarb 26 , BUN 20 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 230. White blood cell
count 5 , hemoglobin 12.5 , hematocrit 38.1 , platelets 165. PT
14.1 , INR 1 , PTT 37.7. Urinalysis was normal.
Cardiac catheterization performed on 9/23/05 at Opa Mapalmmoss Medical Center 90% proximal left main , 100% proximal LAD , 85%
ostial OM-1 , 75% RCA with right dominant circulation. EKG on
2/21/05 showed normal sinus rhythm at 79 with a left bundle
branch block. Chest x-ray on 2/21/05 was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac catheterization was performed on
9/23/05 which revealed critical coronary artery disease and the
patient was referred for immediate surgery. The following
morning , the patient was brought to the operating room where Dr.
Cappleman performed a CABG x5 using a LIMA to the LAD and sequential
graft connecting the aorta to the acute marginal and then the PDA
using saphenous vein graft. A second saphenous vein graft
connected the aorta to the OMA-1 and then the OM-2. The aortic
cross-clamp time was 68 minutes and the total cardiopulmonary
bypass time was 119 minutes. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred postoperatively to the Intensive Care
Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On postoperatively day
1 , the patient was extubated , he was found to be anxious and the
psychiatric medications were restarted. By postoperative day 2 ,
the patient complained of pain , which was highly related to
anxiety. The patient had borderline hypotension , which responded
well to fluid. By the third day after surgery , the patient had
remained hemodynamically stable and was ready for transfer to the
Step-Down Unit for the remainder of his recovery. The patient&apos;s
chest tubes and pacer wires were removed and a follow-up chest
x-ray showed no pleural effusion , pneumothoraces , and only
minimal pulmonary congestion , which responded well to diuretics.
The patient&apos;s postoperative EKGs showed a bundle-branch block
that had existed preoperatively and his cardiologist advised that
the patient could continue a beta-blocker as tolerated. During
the last several days of his hospital stay , the patient required
a lot of reassurance regarding his excellent recovery. He was
ambulating comfortably in the hallways and had remained in the
sinus rhythm with rate in the 70s and stable blood pressure. A
repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of any pulmonary congestion.
By postoperative day 7 , the patient was ready for discharge home
with his wife who is a nurse.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: On the day of discharge , the patient&apos;s
vital signs were as follows: Temperature 97.3 degrees , heart
rate 84 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 126/70 , respiratory rate
20 , and the patient was oxygenating well on room air.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , chloride

HOSPITAL COURSE
73 yo M with known CAD ( s/p multiple CABG and PCI ) , ischemic CMP ( EF
25-30% ) , hyperlipidemia , PVD , IDDM and worsening dyspnea presents with
acute shortness of breath and cyanosis.
1. CV/Pump: iCMP ( EF 25-30% ) NYHA class III. S/p ICD placement. Patient
with progressive volume overload uncontrolled as outpatient. Admitted
with acute decompensation with hypoxia and cyanosis. JVP elevated on
exam. Will diurese aggressively with goal of dry weight ( 175 pounds ). Not
currently on spironolactone or ACEI. The patient responded to diuresis
with lasix 60 mg IV BID. Weight on discharge down to goal of 175 pounds.
Starting a new afternoon sliding scale for diuretics. For each pound over
175 , he will take 20 mg lasix.
2. CV/Ischemia: known severe CAD s/p multiple CABG and PCI with stable
angina at baseline. Episode the morning of admission was his baseline
angina. However , Tn became elevated to 0.33 , but was downtrending. This
is likely demand in the setting of hypoxia/respiratory distress.
His ST depressions on admission were not much changed from baseline , and
resolved by the morning. His ASA and plavix was continued. He is
intolerant of statins.
3. CV/Rhythm: PAF on coumadin. Currently in NSR. Digoxin level 0.4.
4. Pulm: hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema and worsening CHF. However
CXR with little evidence of edema. His saturation improved to 95% on RA
prior to discharge. He felt symptomatically better.
5. Renal: ARF with baseline Cr 1.2. Likely 2/2 DM. UA and urine
protein/creatinine pending on discharge
6. Heme: anticoagulation with coumadin for atrial fibrillation ( Goal INR
2.0 to 3.0 )
7. Vascular: PVD s/p revascularization. Magnesium for leg cramps.
8. FEN: low fat , low cholesterol , 2 gm sodium , 2L fluid restriction.
Replacing electrolytes aggressively. Has sliding scalre K replacement at
home.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to take your lasix and potassium on your sliding scale as you
were before admission.
Continue your original insulin sliding scale.
Weigh yourself daily.
Continue your original outpatient medications
***********
NEW AFTERNOON LASIX SCALE
Take your afternoon weight.
For every pound over 175 , take 20 mg lasix.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Monitor electrolytes while on lasix.
2. Monitor daily weights. Patient is on sliding scale diuretics.
3. Consider other options for lipid lowering ( ie ezetimibe ,
cholestryramine )
4. Consider tighter diabetes control as outpatient fingersticks are 80s
to 300s at home.
5. Consider adding back ACEI when tolerable
6. Consider spironolactone for class III CHF and for K retention.
7. Monitor INR and titrate coumadin
8. f/u HbA1c

ATTENDING: MCAFFEE , EDGARDO MD
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Shadler is a
54-year-old female who was found to have an abnormal EKG during a
preoperative evaluation for partial thyroidectomy , which prompted
a cardiac workup. Stress test revealed ischemic changes and
followup cardiac catheterization revealed mid right coronary
artery stenosis of 70% , proximal right coronary artery with 80%
and the left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal
60% stenosis , left main coronary artery with a mid 70% stenosis ,
left circumflex coronary artery with a proximal 80% stenosis and
a mid 50% stenosis and a right dominant circulation.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial
mitral insufficiency and trivial tricuspid insufficiency.
Carotid noninvasives revealed that the left internal
carotid artery could not be assessed due to the patient&apos;s body habitus and
large goiter , but did reveal relatively diminished diastolic flow in the right
common carotid artery with a velocity 69 cm per second proximally and 62 cm per
second mid , 53 cm per second distally. Velocities in the left
common carotid artery 92 cm per second approximately , 62 cm per
second mid , and 73 cm per second distally. CT
angiogram of the neck on 10/10/06 revealed the following:
1. High-grade stenosis or possible complete occlusion of the
right cervical ICA at origin , the possibility of a very small
caliber residual voluminous suggested catheterization.
Angiography is recommended for further assessment.
2. Very high-grade narrowing of the left proximal ICA at its
origin by complex calcified and likely ulcerative plaque.
3. Internal carotid artery cavernous segment stenosis on the
left is likely mild-to-moderate.
4. Mild proximal basilar artery stenosis.
5. Vertebral artery origin stenosis cannot be excluded. They
are not well evaluated due to beam hardening related to body
habitus.
6. Large neurogenous thyroid lesions are most suggestive of
goiter , although more aggressive lesions cannot be completely
excluded. Clinical correlation and thyroid ultrasound could be
performed for further evaluation if indicated.
7. Cervical spine degenerative disease and stenosis in the lower
C-spine. The patient underwent repeat CT of the head and neck.
Final report is not available at this time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for
class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical
activity , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia , status post brain tumor

Discharge Date: 8/15/2001
Mr. Depedro is a 58-year-old gentleman , who was admitted to
Surg Ship Sing Hospital on 6/9/01 with coronary artery
disease. He went to the cardiac cath lab on 6/9/01 for elective
cardiac catheterization. Primary indication was a positive stress
test and known coronary artery disease. He has a past medical
history that includes diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent for 30
years , a former smoker and also has asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. His coronary angiography demonstrated a 60%
discrete left main coronary artery lesion. No significant left
anterior descending coronary lesions were identified. He had a
discrete 50% lesion of the second diagonal. No significant
circumflex lesions and no significant right coronary lesions. He
was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting and was seen in
consultation by the cardiac surgical service. He has a prior
history of coronary artery disease and had undergone percutaneous
angioplasty in 1993. His surgical history includes a right lower
lobe wedge resection for a ____________. His medication on
admission are Cardizem 180 mg once a day , Avapro 150 mg once a day ,
Allegra 180 mg once a day , Lipitor 40 mg once a day , Pulmicort
twice a day , Rhinocort , Proventil inhalers , also Lente Insulin ,
Humalog as needed and doxycycline p.r.n. , multivitamins , vitamin E
and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg. He has no known drug allergies.
His physical exam is unremarkable. His neck is supple. He has no
carotid bruits. His cardiac exam is regular rhythm. Normal S1/S2
without murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft and nontender. Extremities with no lower extremity
edema , varicose veins. Peripheral pulses are intact.
Labs on admission include a glucose of 267 , BUN and creatinine of
16/1.0 , white blood cell count 9.5 , hematocrit of 43.6 , platelets
252. His liver function tests were within normal limits and his
urinalysis negative. Chest x-ray was clear. EKG demonstrated
sinus rhythm , 55 beats/minute and no ST-T wave changes. He had had
a SPECT on 8/25/01 , which demonstrated post stress ejection
fraction of 47% with moderate inferior wall hypokinesis , mid to
distal anterior and anteroseptal wall hypokinesis.
He was seen in consultation with the plastic surgery service for
potential left radial artery harvest for his bypass grafting. His
Allen&apos;s test by plastics for his left hand demonstrated a good
pulse and he was determined to be a good candidate for left radial
harvesting. He went to the operating room on 6/2/01 , where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery. A left
radial to the first diagonal and a left radial has a skip to the
obtuse marginal #1. His intraoperative course was unremarkable.
Postoperative course was unremarkable. He was placed on a Portland
protocol for blood sugar control and the diabetic management
service was consulted to help in his diabetic management. He was

430282850 | DGH | 74886372 | | 113661 | 9/10/1997 12:00:00 AM | DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 7/19/1997 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 6/7/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM: NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year-old female
with dilated cardiomyopathy who is
admitted for transplant evaluation. The patient initially
presented in 1991 with substernal chest pain. At that time , it was
thought that she was having a myocardial infarction and
Streptokinase was given; however details are not known. An
echocardiogram at that time showed that her ejection fraction was
35-40% with evidence an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. An ETT
Thallium showed fixed anteroseptal and apical defects. Cardiac
catheterization showed clean coronaries. The patient was referred
to Terself Health where an exercise bicycle test
showed 6 minutes and 22 seconds of exercise. Her peak heart rate
was 113 with a peak blood pressure of 140/60 and a peak VO2 of 11.6
ml per kg per minute. The patient apparently did well until about
a year prior to admission when she noted a gradual decrease in her
exercise tolerance. At an outside , she was hospitalized for
congestive heart failure symptoms. Lately , the patient noticed
that she is unable to walk without becoming short of breath. In
January of 1997 , the patient was able to walk one mile , but is now
unable to do so. The patient reports stopping several times while
trying to climb one flight of stairs. She does report orthopnea as
well as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no light headedness or
syncope. She does have some palpitations as well as complaints of
twinges under left breast that occur randomly. She does not
experience any leg swelling. The patient saw Dr. Ontiveros on
September , 1997 at which time an echocardiogram showed a
massively dilated left ventricle with severely depressed systolic
function and an ejection fraction of 15%. All walls were severely
hypokinetic. There was moderate left atrial enlargement and
moderate mitral regurgitation. There was normal right ventricular
size and function and no thrombus or pericardial effusion. The
patient underwent a bicycle test for which achieved 5 minutes and
33 seconds with a maximal heart rate of 108 and a VO2 of 6.4 ml per
kg per minute.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for 1 ) History of bronchitis.
2 ) History of cardiomyopathy as above. 3 )
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 4 ) Status post
hysterectomy at age 40. 5 ) Status post cholecystectomy. 6 )
Status post appendectomy. 7 ) History of panic disorders. 8 )
History of agoraphobia. 9 ) History of alcohol use.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. four times a
week and 5 mg p.o. three times a week.
2 ) Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4 ) Micronase 2.5 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Multivitamins one tablet
p.o. q. day. 6 ) Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. 7 ) Xanax 0.5 mg p.o.
q.i.d. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her parents both died with cardiac problems with
coronary artery disease ( father at age 42 , mother
at age 62 ).
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone with an apartment next to
her son. She has worked as a house cleaner. She
has an 18 pack year history of cigarette smoking; she quit smoking
30 years ago. She does have a history of heavy alcohol use. She
is recently divorced.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is pleasant in no apparent
distress. The patient is afebrile with a
blood pressure of 110/76 , heart rate 70 and a respiratory rate of
20 with oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her head examination
is remarkable for upper dentures. Neck shows jugular venous
pressure of 7 cm. Carotid upstrokes are decreased and without
bruits. There was no lymphadenopathy. Lungs show occasional
bibasilar rales. Heart shows regular rate and rhythm with distant
heart sounds. There is a left ventricular heave and an S3 present.
The abdomen is obese with bowel sounds present , soft , non-tender
without masses. The extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Pulses are intact bilaterally and the extremities are warm.
Neurological examination is non-focal with intact sensation and
motor examination. Deep tendon reflexes are symmetric and 2+
bilaterally with downgoing toes bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for a transplantation
work-up. She was catheterized on February ,
1997. The catheterization showed no coronary artery disease noted.
The atrium showed 16 mm of mercury mean pressure. The right
ventricle showed 48/18 mm of mercury. The PA showed 48/34 mm of
mercury with a mean pressure of 39 mm of mercury. The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure showed a mean of 30 mm of mercury.
Cardiac output and cardiac index showed 4.4 liters per minute and
2.2 liters per minute per meter squared. The patient was briefly
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit secondary to her elevated
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the presence of her
Swan-Ganz catheter. The patient was diuresed with good response.
She was transferred back to the General Medicine Team where
diuresis with intravenous Lasix was continued. She tolerated
Enalapril and Lasix well. By the end of her hospitalization , she
was taking 12.5 mg of Enalapril b.i.d. and 40 mg of Lasix p.o.
b.i.d. She had been taken off her Coumadin and had been placed on
Heparin during this hospitalization. The patient did experience
some hematuria toward the end of her hospitalization which was felt
to be secondary to Foley trauma while she was in the Coronary Care
Unit.
As part of the patient&apos;s transplant evaluation , she had a PPD with
controls placed which showed that her PPD was negative and her
controls were positive. The patient underwent a Dental consult as
well as a Psychiatric consult. The Psychiatric evaluation was
favorable for transplantation. The Dental consult involved the
patient having panoramic x-rays. Thyrology showed a
cytomegalovirus IgG being positive , a cytomegalovirus IgM being
equivocal , and Epstein-Barr virus anti-VCA IgG at 640 , an
Epstein-Barr virus anti-VCA IgM being less than 10 and a mucal
screen being greater than or equal to 32 , a varicella zoster titer
of 512 , a Toxoplasma IgG being positive , a Toxoplasma IgM being
negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed a mildly dilated common bile
and pancreatic duct and showed that this patient was status post
cholecystectomy.
While the patient maybe a good transplant candidate , it was felt
that her weight was a negative factor in her potential for
transplant. The patient will be pursuing cardiac rehabilitation
and weight loss if she is to be considered for transplant in the
future. The patient was discharged.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
headache. 2 ) Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.
3 ) Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Enalapril 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d. 5 ) Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6 ) Micronase 1.25 mg p.o. q.
day. 7 ) Multivitamins one tablet p.o. q. day. 8 ) Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q. day on even days and 5 mg p.o. q. day on odd days.
INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed that she should increase
her diuresis at home if she noticed an increase in
her weight and was instructed to see a physician for continued for
weight increases due to fluid accumulation.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This 64 year-old right-handed woman presented after being found down and
weak on the left. She has a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung
cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy
treatments. She presented outside the window for thrombolysis or
intervention. Exam revealed plegia of the left face and arm , paresis of
the left leg , and an incomplete neglect syndrome. MRI/MRA revealed
partial right MCA territory stroke and suggested severe proximal right
ICA stenosis; she was placed on heparin. Antihypertensives , aside from
low-dose metoprolol , were held. CT/CTA head and neck the following day
confirmed a severe proximal right ICA stenosis and revealed evolution of
the stroke to involve much of the right MCA territory. The heparin was
discontinued and the patient placed back on clopidogrel. The Hoaggan Memorial Hospital
under Dr. Aiu evaluated the patient and recommended a follow-up
appointment with him two weeks after discharge.
Laboratory work-up pertinent to stroke revealed a normal homocysteine ,
normal TSH , lipid profile with LDL 108 , HDL 52 , TG 131 , and Lp( a )
lipoprotein elevated at 93. She was continued on a statin , and low-dose
niacin added to the regimen because of the Lp( a ) results. Her hemoglobin
A1c and random blood sugars were elevated; she received an insulin
sliding scale. Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF and size , no wall motion
abnormalities , + evidence of diastolic dysfunction , and normal LA size.
Her cell counts trended downward in an expected fashion given the timing
of her most recent chemotherapy. She was placed on neutropenic
precautions. Her oncologist Dr. Batrez recommended administering
prophylactic ciprofloxacin and a single dose of long-acting G-CSF. She is
not planned to receive any additional chemotherapeutic or radiation
therapy treatments in the near future.
Her neurological examination remained stable. Repeat head CTs done to
assess for edema following the stroke revealed some effacement of the
right lateral ventricle , but no threatening mass effect.
Her serum sodium trended down throughout admission; it is recommended
that she not receive hypotonic fluids at rehab and that she be water
restricted to 1L per day , and take salt as directed.
Given her thrombocytopenia , it is recommended that antiplatelet therapy
with clopidogrel be held until her platelet count rises over 100. It is
also recommended that anticoagulation with therapeutic low-molecular
weight heparin as bridge to warfarin with target INR 2-3 be restarted 2
weeks after her stroke , on 2/16/05. She should follow up for
neurological issues with Dr. Sagan of neurosurgery as well as her
outpatient neurologist , Dr. Collin Krauskopf , at Cako Hospital
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
1. hold clopidogrel until plt &gt; 100k
2. start low-molecular weight heparin as a bridge to warfarin ( target INR
2-3 ) and discontinue clopidogrel 7/1/05
3. Free water restrict 1L per day , follow serum sodium.
4. Follow up with Dr. Amoah in 2 weeks.

ATTENDING: WARNECKE , BLAIR E.
SERVICE: Kata O
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Altered mental status ,
seizure , hypertensive emergency , end-stage renal disease and
hepatitis C.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old man
with type 1 diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
history of polysubstance abuse and hepatitis C who was in his
usual state of health until hemodialysis on 2/18/06 , when he was
noted to be lethargic after hemodialysis. He came to the
emergency room where he also complained of headache and chest
pain. He was noted to have blood pressure of 202/91 and lateral
ST depression on EKG and a mild troponin leak. He was given
nitroglycerin paste , labetolol 10 mg IV with resolution of the
headache , chest pain and decrease of the blood pressure into the
160s. On chest x-ray , he was also noted to have bilateral lower
lobe pneumonia. The patient remained lethargic. The head CT was
negative. Of note , the patient has a recent admission to the
A Hospital with hypoglycemia , pneumonia and C. difficile
colitis for which he is completing a course of vancomycin ,
Levaquin and Flagyl. The patient lives in a nursing home. The
records show that his baseline blood pressure is 160-180
systolic. He has had hypertension to the 200s for a week prior
to admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , type 1 diabetes for 30 years , poorly-controlled
hypertension , hepatitis B and C with previous treatment with
interferon , possible ethanol-related liver disease , asthma ,
peptic ulcer disease and peripheral vascular disease with history
of toe amputation.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone , although recently he
has been living in a nursing home. He is separated from his wife
and children who live out of state. He is a former smoker and
alcohol abuser. He has a history of heroin use and cocaine use
but currently not abusing either.
ALLERGIES: The patient is noted to have an allergy to aspirin
with the reaction being epistaxis , although this is not a true
allergy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , notable findings were an
altered mental status. The patient was somnolent and confused
but was without other significant physical findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with hypertensive
emergency with mild troponin leak likely secondary to demand
ischemia. Labetolol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. was added to his
antihypertensive regimen this admission and the patient&apos;s blood
pressure was reasonably well controlled throughout the admission.
2. Infectious disease: The patient is being empirically treated
for likely cavitary pneumonia that was observed upon chest CT.
The patient has clinically improved on ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q.d. and will be discharged on a 7-day course of the same. The
patient also has a history of C. difficile colitis and has been
treated with Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission and
was discharged on a 14-day course of the same. Blood cultures
during this admission have been negative to date. The patient
was PPD negative and induced sputum was negative by acid fast
tests for evidence of tuberculosis.
3. GI: The patient complained of left lower quadrant pain prior
to dialysis on 10/30 and some involuntary guarding was apparently
appreciated. CT of the abdomen ruled out
an acute abdominal process and the patient has been without
abdominal pain throughout the rest of the hospitalization. The
patient&apos;s laboratory studies are notable for an elevated alkaline phosphatase
with unclear etiology. The patient has no Murphy
sign or other signs of cholecystitis that could be appreciated.
4. Neurology: The patient presented with altered mental status
on admission. He was confused and somnolent. Within 2 days of admission , he
was much improved and was alert and oriented x3.
The altered mental status was most likely secondary to pneumonia.
The patient reportedly had a tonic-clonic seizure in
hemodialysis on 11/12/06. Neurology was consulted and thought
this was most likely secondary to fluid , electrolytes shifts in
dialysis. The patient had both EEG and brain MRI , which were
normal during this admission.
5. Renal. The patient has end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis and dialysis was continued Monday , Wednesday and
Friday according to his usual schedule.
6. Endocrine. The patient is a brittle type 1 diabetic and
early in his hospital course , he had frequent episode of
hypoglycemia which responded to an AMP of D50. the patient&apos;s
insulin regimen at the time of discharge , on which his sugars were
reasonably well controlled without episodes of hypoglycemia , was
Lantus 4 units q.a.m. Lantus 4 units q.p.m. with NovoLog 3 units
with breakfast and 3 units with lunch and NovoLog 2 units with
dinner and sliding scale NovaLog used only when fingersticks were
greater than 400.
7. Pulmonology The patient has left lower lobe cavitary
lesion observed on chest CT that may be malignant , although it
most likely represented pneumonia. He needs to follow up chest
CT in 6-8 weeks to confirm if this lesion was pneumonia and that
it has completely resolved.
The patient had a history of COPD/asthma and continued on Advair during this
admission.
At the time of discharge , the patient was afebrile with heart rate
in the 90s , systolic pressure ranging from 140-160/60-80 and
