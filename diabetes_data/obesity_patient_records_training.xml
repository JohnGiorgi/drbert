PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Anemia and GI bleed.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Diabetes , mitral valve replacement , atrial
fibrillation , and chronic kidney disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes , chronic kidney disease , congestive
heart failure with ejection fraction of 45% to 50% who presents
from clinic with a chief complaint of fatigue and weakness for
one week. She had had worsening right groin and hip pain , status
post a total hip replacement approximately 13 years ago which had
been worsening for two weeks , and she has also recently completed
a course of Levaquin for urinary tract infection. She presented
to Dr. Parrent office complaining of fatigue and weakness for one
week. She has had some abdominal pain in a band-like
distribution around her right side. She was found to have a
hematocrit of 21 down from 30 eight days ago and was sent to the
emergency department for transfusion and workup of her anemia.

daily , iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. daily , and multivitamin daily.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic kidney disease , presumed due to
congestive heart failure/diuresis/renal artery disease/early
diabetic nephropathy; type 2 diabetes; previous stroke;
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 45% to 50%;
rheumatic valvular disease with mitral valve replacement and
tricuspid valve repair; atrial fibrillation; history of small
bowel obstruction; status post right total hip replacement
approximately 13 years ago.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of kidney disease or heart
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has 10 children , lives alone with home care
in ME , but has moved in to live with her daughter in
News Irv In She denies tobacco use and drinks alcohol rarely.
ALLERGIES: Codeine and Benadryl.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs were temperature
96.7 , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 153/74 , respirations 22 , and
SaO2 95% on room air. The patient is a frail elderly woman in no
acute distress. She has poor dentition. JVP is difficult to
assess secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed bradycardia
with heart rate in the 50s that was irregular , S1 plus S2 with
3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout with mechanical sounding S2.
Abdomen was mildly tender to palpation in the mid epigastrium
with no rebound or guarding. Extremities showed venous stasis
changes in her lower extremities bilaterally. Feet were cool
with diminished DP and PT pulses. On neurological exam , she was
alert and oriented x3 and cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.
STUDIES: EKG showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response with heart rate of 53 , widened QRS , a Q wave in aVL , and
U waves in the lateral leads.
Chest x-ray showed improved pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , stable marked
cardiomegaly.
X-ray of the right hip showed ,
1. Status post right total hip arthroplasty with stable
periprosthetic lucency and cortical remodeling.
2. Severe left hip osteoarthritis.
3. Diffuse atherosclerosis.
EGD on 10/24/06 showed hiatal hernia , fundic polyps with
pathology showing hypoplastic and inflammatory lesions; mild
antral erosions with pathology demonstrating mild regeneration
that was nonspecific and no H. pylori; and duodenitis with
pathology showing normal mucosa but no active bleeding or signs
of recent bleeding.
Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed a healing gastric ulcer likely in the
antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and angioectasia in the distal small
bowel.
Colonoscopy on 9/12/06 demonstrated cecal diverticulum , approximately 3-mm
ascending sessile polyp and several small sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid.
PROCEDURE: Right basilic vein transposition on 9/12/06 by Dr.
Jacinto Goonez .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. GI bleed: In the emergency department , the patient&apos;s vital
signs were temperature 95.4 , heart rate 62 , respirations 16 ,
blood pressure 127/66 with SaO2 98% on room air. She was found
to have black guaiac positive stool and GI was consulted. She
was started on IV Nexium 20 mg b.i.d. and was given vitamin K 10
mg subcutaneously and two units of FFP , and she was transfused
three units of packed red blood cells with Lasix 120 mg IV for
each bag. Of note , the patient had a colonoscopy in
Wa on 8/26/05 , which showed bleeding rectal ulcers with
biopsies consistent with ischemic colitis. An EGD on 10/24/06
showed a hiatal hernia; fundic polyps ( path:
hypoplastic/inflammatory ); mild antral erosions ( path: mild
regeneration , nonspecific; no H. pylori ); duodenitis ( path:
normal mucosa ) , but no active bleeding or signs of recent
bleeding. Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed healing gastric
ulcer likely in the antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and
angioectasia in the distal small bowel , which were considered the
likely sources of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed on
9/12/06 to search for angioectasias for which intervention would
be possible , but demonstrated only a cecal diverticulum and
approximately 3 mm ascending sessile polyp and several small
sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid. The patient was started on
Aranesp but had a 5-point hematocrit drop from 32 to 27 on
9/12/06 for which she required another two units of blood along
with Lasix. The patient&apos;s hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 30 to 32 and she will be restarted on
anticoagulation on Thursday , 12/10/06 , one week after her AV
fistula surgery.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is being
considered for a possible hemodialysis in the future. She was
continued on her Caltrate plus D , multivitamin , and iron
supplementation and she was started on Aranesp 25 mcg weekly and
was given sevelamer 400 mg q.a.c. for elevated phosphate levels.
Vein mapping study was performed on 7/25/06 , and a right basilic
vein transposition was performed on 9/12/06 by Dr. Landrie . The
patient had postoperative right hand coolness , numbness , and
weakness ( always with dopplerable radial pulse ) from steal
versus neurapraxia , which was improved by the time of discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. Chanthasene as an outpatient. The
patient&apos;s creatinine was 3.3 on admission , improved to 2.0 by
9/12/06 , which was the day of her surgery and increased again to
3.2 on 1/10/06 .  She was given IV Lasix boluses as she had
evidence of volume overload with over eight-pound weight gain
during her hospitalization , and creatinine improved to 2.7 by the
day of discharge.
3. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient&apos;s ejection fraction is 45% to 50% and she was
given 120 mg of IV Lasix for each unit of packed red blood cells
she received , along with 120 mg p.o. daily with IV boluses of 180
mg as needed for volume overload as judged by an increase in her
weight. Antihypertensive medications were originally held for
her GI bleed and they were restarted on 10/24/06 with systolic
blood pressures remaining in the 120s to 130s.
Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular response with heart rates as low as the upper 30s.
Occasionally , her heart rate appeared regular and was thought to
be junctional escape rhythm. She was asymptomatic throughout her
hospitalization. She was discussed with her cardiologist , Dr.
Fritz , who will consider a pacemaker as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine: She is euthyroid with TSH of 2.422. For her
diabetes , she received nightly Lantus with aspart q.a.c. and
sliding scale when eating and Regular insulin sliding scale q.6h.
when n.p.o. Fingersticks were elevated to 300s early during this
admission but improved to the 100s upon increasing her insulin
dose.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right total hip
replacement approximately 13 years ago and complained of right
hip pain upon admission. An x-ray showed stable arthroplasty and
the pain was improved by the morning of 10/24/06 .  She will
follow with physiatrist , Dr. Allan Kofoed .
COMPLICATIONS: Right hand weakness , numbness , and coolness
status post AV fistula surgery , possibly secondary to steal or
neurapraxia , significantly improved by the time of discharge.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. Garfield Kiehne from vascular surgery , Dr. Ambrose Moldrem from gastroenterology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: Stable vital signs. Lungs
with bibasilar crackles. 3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout
plus a mechanical S2. Abdomen benign. Lower extremities with
chronic venous stasis changes. Right upper extremity AV fistula
with +thrill. Decreased right radial pulse with warm
hand distally , and 4/5 strength in hand grip of the right hand.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg daily , Caltrate plus D one
tablet p.o. b.i.d. , Aranesp 25 mcg subcu weekly , Lovenox 50 mg
subcu daily starting on Thursday 12/10/06 ( to be discontinued when patient&apos;s

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DROEGMILLER , STANTON MD
DATE OF DISCHARGE: Not known at the time of this interim
dictation.
SERVICE: List Medical Center .
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Postpartum cardiomyopathy status post
mitral valve repair , status post tricuspid valve repair , status
post ICD/pacer placement , asthma , and anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 33-year-old female with a
history of postpartum cardiomyopathy ( EF 15% to 20% ) , status post
pacer/ICD placement , status post mitral valve
replacement/tricuspid valve replacement , who presents with
abdominal pain , decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , and
occasional chest pain. The patient has had multiple recent
admissions to H/seases Medical Center .  In October 2005 , the
patient presented with chest pain and was found to be in
decompensated heart failure. She ruled out for myocardial
infarction. She was diuresed with torsemide. A MIBI prior to
this admission in October 2005 had showed no evidence of
ischemia. The patient was more recently readmitted in July
2005. During this admission , she underwent mitral valve repair
and tricuspid valve repair given severe mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation. She had a catheterization on 6/12/05 ,
which showed normal coronary arteries , no equalization of
diastolic pressures , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 ,
and 4+ mitral regurgitation. A TTE during this admission showed
an EF of 15% to 20% with wall motion abnormalities. She had mild
right ventricular enlargement and decreased right ventricular
function. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 16 plus right
atrial pressures. She was also found to have a 1.5-cm
pericardial effusion. On this admission , the patient&apos;s primary
complaints involve decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , and
abdominal pain. The patient reports frequent vomiting after
meals. The vomitus is nonbloody and nonbilious. The patient
denies diarrhea , in fact , she has been constipated. Her last
bowel movement was on the day of admission , but she did not have
a bowel movement four to five days prior to this time. She
denies fever or chills. She denies dysuria or hematuria. She
denies melena or bright red blood per rectum. She reports
intermittent shortness of breath , which she believes to be her
baseline. She denies weight gain , orthopnea , or PND. The
patient reports occasional tightness in her left chest , which
occurs a few times each week. There are no associated ischemic
symptoms. The pain is nonexertional and it is pleuritic. In the
emergency room , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 97 and a
blood pressure of 98/58. Her cardiac enzymes were negative x1.
A PE protocol CT was negative for pulmonary embolus. The patient
was noted on this CAT scan to have a pericardial effusion. The
patient was seen by the Cardiology Service who performed a
bedside echocardiogram , which showed effusion , but no evidence of
right atrial or right ventricular collapse.

through V6 as well as leads I , aVL , II , III , and aVF. Urinalysis
shows trace leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4 to 8 white
blood cells , no red blood cells , and 1+ bacteria. Urine hCG is
negative. Chest x-ray shows stable cardiomegaly without
pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia. The patient reported chest pain on admission. The
chest pain was atypical for ischemia and that it was
nonexertional. It was pleuritic and it had no associated
ischemic symptoms. In addition , the patient had normal
coronaries on a recent catheterization in 3/22 as well as a
nonischemic MIBI in October 2005. The patient&apos;s enzymes were
negative on this admission. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker.
b. Pump. The patient has a postpartum cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She also has a pericardial
effusion on this admission. On admission , there was no evidence
of tamponade by exam or by echocardiogram. The patient had a
repeat TTE on 10/18/05 , which showed pericardial effusion , which
was slightly larger than that seen in July 2005. There was
respirophasic variation , but no collapse. The patient&apos;s urine
output decreased on 8/26/05 and she underwent right heart
catheterization , which showed extremely elevated right and left
filling pressures ( pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the 40s ,
right atrial pressure 27 ). The patient was initially placed on a
Lasix drip. She was also started on IV dobutamine to maintain
her blood pressure and for perfusion while being diuresed. After
a few days on this regimen , the patient had a repeat right heart
catheterization , which showed improved , but elevated left and
right filling pressures. A Swan catheter was left in place for
closer monitoring of the patient&apos;s hemodynamics and to allow for
tailored therapy. At the time of this dictation , the patient
will be tried on various inotropes including dopamine and
dobutamine with close monitoring of her hemodynamics. The
purpose of this is to assess the effect of these inotropes on her
hemodynamics , so there would be a time when she requires inotrope
therapy at home. The patient was also maintained on digoxin.
Her Aldactone was changed to eplerenone given the possibility
that Aldactone could be contributing to the patient&apos;s GI
complaints. At the time of this dictation , there is a plan in
place to try to add hydralazine/Isordil to the patient&apos;s regimen
for afterload reduction if her blood pressure can tolerate this.
In the past , the patient had suffered severe hypotension when
such medications have been added.
c. Rhythm. The patient is status post pacer/ICD placement. She
was monitored on telemetry. Her telemetry will be followed
closely for any evidence of ectopy while on dobutamine or
dopamine.
2. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of chronic cough. Past
chest CTs have shown ground-glass opacities most likely due to
edema , which have resolved on more recent imaging. Pulmonary
function test in July 2005 showed an FEV1 of 2.06 , FEV1/FVC of
102 , total lung capacity of 3.09 , and a DLCO corrected of 54%
predicted. The patient was continued on Advair and was given
Atrovent p.r.n. As mentioned previously , a PECT on admission was
negative.
3. Renal/FEN: The patient has hypokalemia in the setting of
diuresis. Her electrolytes were monitored b.i.d. and repleted as
needed. The patient&apos;s creatinine remained stable less than 1
throughout her admission. The patient was maintained on a
low-salt , food-restricted diet.
4. GI: The patient presented with a number of GI complaints
including abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and anorexia. It is
not clear what the cause of these symptoms is. The patient had
normal liver function tests. She had a KUB , which showed no
obstruction. Her urine culture showed no evidence of urinary
tract infection. It is possible that abdominal pain was due to
constipation or as a side effect of Aldactone or even to a low
flow state in the setting decompensated heart failure. The
patient was continued on a bowel regimen and a proton pump
inhibitor. At the time of this dictation , the patient&apos;s
abdominal complaints have resolved.
5. Heme: The patient has a history of iron-deficiency anemia.
On admission , her hematocrit was 30 with a MCV of 79.4. The
patient takes iron supplementation at home. This was held
temporarily in the setting of constipation. The patient also
takes Coumadin for a low ejection fraction. This is also placed
on hold in the setting of various procedures including her right
heart catheterizations and PA catheter placement. It should be
noted that the patient has a history of HIT positive.
6. ID: On 9/15/05 , the patient had a temperature of 100. This
was status post placement of a PA catheter. There was concern
for a line infection. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient
was started on vancomycin. At the time of this dictation , blood
cultures showed no growths to date , but should continue to be
followed.
7. Psych: The patient has a history of depression. She
appeared dysphoric on admission , but denied any suicidality.
Both Psychiatry and Social Work were contacted who followed the
patient during this admission and who have followed the patient
on previous admission. The Psychiatry Service had recommended
Remeron for sleep , which the patient was given with good effect.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was given Pneumoboots early on in
her admission and then was out of bed several times each day.
She was also given a proton pump inhibitor.
9. Code: The patient is full code.
The events that occur after the time of this dictation , the
disposition , discharge condition , followup , and discharge
medications will be dictated in an addendum to this discharge
summary.

Discharge Date: 12/10/1993
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ,
HYPERTENSION.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year old male
immigrant from Tope Ri
with a long history of angina. He had been followed in the O Lake Jack for years with strong indication for interventional
evaluation of his coronary artery disease. The patient had refused
and had been being treated medically inspite of the angina pattern.
Recently his angina had worsened and he agreed to undergo more
intensive workup. He was referred for elective cardiac
catheterization. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hospitalization for an
episode of chest pain in S , hypertension and history
of peripheral vascular disease with claudication symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam the patient&apos;s temperature
was 97.7 , heart rate 60. HEENT: Head and
neck exam unremarkable. Lungs: Clear anteriorly. Heart: Regular
rate and rhythm , no murmurs appreciated. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender.
EXTREMITIES: No edema. Had weakly dopplerable pulses. Of note , his
physical exam was performed on his emergent admission to the
cardiac care unit after becoming unstable at elective cardiac
catheterization.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: His admission laboratory exam was
remarkable for a normal CBC and serum 20
general exam. His EKG after cardiac catheterization demonstrated
inverted T waves in III , F and some ST depression in V4-V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On elective cardiac catheterization the patient
was noted to have a 90% ostial left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion. He had EKG changes ,
symptomatically had chest pain at catheterization. He was referred
for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. An intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed. He was taken emergently to the Operating
Room where a 4 vessel coronary artery bypass was performed. There
were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively , the patient
did remarkably well inspite of his dramatic presentation. He had
no vascular complications. His intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed without incident and he had no specific cardiopulmonary
complications. His only issue at discharge was urinary retention.
He failed several voiding trials. Urology Service had consulted and
felt this was likely secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with an indwelling Foley
catheter with follow-up arranged at AMC Urology.
MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications include aspirin 1 a day ,
iron , Colace , Mevacor 20mg q day and Tylenol #3 p.r.n. He will
follow-up with his Cardiologist , urology service and with cardiac
surgery.

ATTENDING: SATOW , DARNELL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
This is a 64-year-old woman with a history of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy who was admitted with increasing volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Schmittou was doing well until approximately two weeks prior to
admission when in the setting of dietary indiscretion she noticed
some shortness of breath and weight gain. She states that she
started to increase her Demadex from 200 mg in the morning and
150 mg in the afternoon to 200 mg b.i.d. without significant
diuresis. She has continued to participate in cardiac rehab
without significant difficulty. Her weight was stable at 174.
She did , however , noticed worsening of intermittent dyspnea on
exertion and orthopnea , although she denied PND or pedal edema.
She denied abdominal symptoms of bloating , no satiety , nausea or
vomiting. She denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,
lightheadedness or syncope. She does have occasional chest
burning. She also noted burning in her feet bilaterally which
has previously been attributed to neuropathy. On the day of
admission , she presented to the Outpatient Clinic to have an
echocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygen
uptake. She exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving a
peak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64
and stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak oxygen uptake was
only 9 mL per minute despite on RER of 1.09. This is essentially
unchanged from a prior exercise stress test one year ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 1996 , with clean
coronary catheterization at that point. She has history of
hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , and left bundle-branch block
status post ICD and pacemaker placement. Her pacer is
biventricular. She also has a history of urine bleeding. She
had a recent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which were
unremarkable.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily ,
Demadex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg daily , KCl 10 mEq
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily and
Evista 60 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 104/66.
Her weight was 174. Her JVP was at approximately 16 cm of water
with hepatojugular reflux to the angle of the jaw. Her carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her cardiac exam was regular in rate
and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and audible S3. She has 2/6
systolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. Her
abdominal exam was benign except for liver edge that is palpable
approximately two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. Her
extremities were noncyanotic with no clubbing or edema. They
were lukewarm.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Unremarkable.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
LABORATORY DATA:
Her most recent labs had showed a sodium of 138 , a potassium 3.9 ,
a BUN of 67 , a creatinine of 1.9 and glucose of 123. Her LFTs
were all normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin of 1.3. Her
last lipids showed a total cholesterol of 128 with 191
triglycerides and HDL of 31 and an LDL of 59. Her last CBC was
unremarkable. Her EKG shows an a-sensed V-paced rhythm at the
rate of 72 beats per minute.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Cardiovascular: Ms. Helger is a 64-year-old female with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy and class II-III symptoms who
presented with worsening volume overload in the setting of
dietary indiscretion. Given that she is already maximized on her
outpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renal
function , she was admitted for further diuresis with IV
torsemide. She was also admitted for the beginning of her
transplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. She was
initially started on IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1
to 2 liters of diuresis per day. She was continued on digoxin
and switched over from lisinopril and captopril. Her medications
were adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensive
episodes. She did go for a right heart cath on this
hospitalization that showed increased RA pressure of 14 and a
wedge pressure of 35-44 with V wave. Her cardiac index was
calculated at 1.38. Her SVR was calculated at 1600. Her mixed
venous O2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings were
repeated. Given that she appeared quite well and Lasix drip was
started to accelerate her diuresis. She was maintained on
tailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction and
the up titration of her captopril. She did have impressive
diuresis on Lasix drip. Her transplant workup at this time
included PFTs that showed an FVC of 2.64 , which his 86% predicted
an FEV1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and FEV1 to FVC ratio of
69%. Her corrected DLCO was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.
She did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing no
significant stenosis in either carotid artery. Her ankle
brachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremities
and her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. Her
24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the total
volume which was in the normal range. She did continued to
respond reasonable well to the diuresis with the exception of a
few episodes of asymptomatic hypotension. Her creatinine did
begin to bump marginally indicating that she had likely been
slightly over diuresed. She subsequently stabilized and was
discharged on a stable dose of diuretics including torsemide 100
mg p.o. b.i.d.
Her other discharge medications include captopril 25 mg t.i.d. ,
Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Claritin , Coumadin 5 mg daily , thiamine and
multivitamin , colchicine , magnesium , Evista , Aldactone 25 mg
daily , digoxin 0.125 mg daily and allopurinol 100 mg daily ,
Toprol-XL 25 mg daily.
She was discharged with plan for regular follow up with her
outpatient cardiologist.

There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which is
unchanged from prior x-rays. Right lung is clear. There is a
small left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced in
size compared to his previous x-ray dated 8/29/07 .
2. EKG revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 44. There is left axis deviation , a
right bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , which
is unchanged from an EKG in 5/3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 82-year-old gentleman
with a history of multiple medical problems most significantly
including recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CAD
status post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slow
ventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation with
a fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures with
concerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient was
initially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.
Blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew out
two out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.
Urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000
colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also taken
from the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,
few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once blood
cultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient&apos;s
antibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on
7/17/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. The
patient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any
significant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.
Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have
remained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negative
for any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient&apos;s high
risk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also
negative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. The
patient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his high
risk.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or
chest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABG
and was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was also
continued on statin.
Pump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admission
and was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , he
appeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and then
gradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IV
Lasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At the
time of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , but
diuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient&apos;s Losartan was held
in the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiation
of gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is
96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He should
continue daily weights. Of note , the patient&apos;s dry weight is
approximately 93 kg. Pt&apos;s lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.
Rhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into the
mid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refused
permanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should be
avoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolytes
were checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium
above 4. However , no other medical management was initiated
given his bradycardia.
2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicion
for endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to have
Gemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted above
empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed to
gentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocci
were speciated. The patient was initially treated for
pseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given that
only 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidime
could be discontinued and that there would be some response to
ceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07
for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a
full six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week
course of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite
both negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram
given his high risk for endocarditis.
3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonix
and all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. The
patient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units
nightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.
5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevated
creatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baseline
of 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likely
be due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient was
diuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time of
discharge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartan
was held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.
6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time of
admission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 4/10
due to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter was
clamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mL
and the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,
so Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulled
without difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a sterile
dry dressing to be changed daily.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has a
current input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluid
restriction.
Electrolytes. The patient has been having twice daily
electrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and his
potassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg of
Lasix daily. This should be continued.
Nutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodium
diet and a 2 L fluid restriction.
8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent and
albuterol.
9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily for
iron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mild
eosinophilia , which should be followed.
10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on his
right hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment and
sterile dry dressing changes daily.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin
5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.
CODE: The patient is full code.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: FEVER , STATUS POST CARDIAC
TRANSPLANT
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA; 2 ) THROMBO-
CYTOPENIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Grissett is a 50 year old
male who is ten years status post
cardiac transplant for an ischemic cardiomyopathy , who presents
with a five week history of a flu like illness and fevers. Cardiac
transplant was in 1985 without complications and in 1989 he had one
episode of herpes zoster , and was treated for cataract. He
remained stable without cardiac symptoms or exertional limitation.
Last had a cardiac catheterization in April of 1994 , showed no
evidence of coronary artery disease , normal LV size and function ,
normal RV and trace MR. Right heart catheterization on 7/10 showed
normal hemodynamics. There was no evidence of rejection on biopsy.
There was no history of signs or symptoms localizing infectious
process until about five weeks prior to this admission when he
developed a flu like symptom , including a dry cough , occasionally
productive of whitish sputum , general malaise , nasal congestion
with occasional blood streaked secretions , arthralgias and fatigue.
He also reports dyspnea on exertion after one flight at moderate
pace with occasional night sweats and loose stools. Multiple family
members were ill with similar symptom complexes. The patient took
one week off from work and felt that he was getting better until
approximately 24 hours prior to admission when he again had
increased weakness , muscle and joint aches , fevers to 101.2 P O ,
shaking chills , continued dry cough and headache. Diarrhea
spontaneously resolved but has had persistent dyspnea on exertion.
The patient denies any PND , orthopnea , chest pain , nausea and
vomiting. Has had anorexia with a 15 pound weight loss in the past
month. He is currently being admitted for evaluation and management
of his flu like illness following his cardiac transplant. He is
immunosuppresed with Cyclosporin , Prednisone and Imuran.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Cardiac transplant; 2 ) hyper-
tension; 3 ) status post bilateral
cataract surgeries; 4 ) herpes
zoster flare.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Vasotec , 10 mg b.i.d.;
2 ) Mevacor , 20 mg q d; 3 ) Imuran ,
150 mg q day; 4 ) Diltiazem CD , 180 mg q d; 5 ) Prednisone , 10 mg q
day; 6 ) Aspirin , 325 mg q d; 7 ) Cyclosporin , 100 mg b.i.d; 8 )
Magnesium; 9 ) Robitussin PRN. The patient has no known drug
allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He smoked one pack per day. Denies
alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a middle aged male in
no apparent distress. Temperature is
99.3 degrees P O. Pulse is 102 and regular. Breaths are 16 , even
and unlabored , 97% oxygen saturation at room air and blood pressure
is 120/76. His skin was within normal limits , mild scleral icterus.
Jugular venous pressure was 6 cm. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally
without bruits. There is no thyromegaly or adenopathy. His lungs
were clear bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2.
There are no murmurs , gallops or rubs. There is a regular rate and
rhythm. His PMI was non displaced. Abdomen was soft and non tender ,
non distended , normoactive bowel sounds with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities without cyanosis , clubbing or edema or rashes. Distal
pulses were 2+ bilaterally and neurological exam was completely non
focal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Of significance , BUN was 27 ,
creatinine 1.8 , white blood cells
were 5.3 , with 71% PMNs and 10% bands , 4% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes
and 4% eosinophils. Platelet count was depressed at 90 , 000 ,
hematocrit was low at 30%; LDH was 302 and elevated; bilirubin was
elevated at 2.2 , total over 1.1 direct and Cyclosporin level on
admission was 276. Admission chest x-ray showed enlarged
mediastinal silhouette. There was no infiltrates or effusion. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia , rate of 106; axis was +6 degrees ,
intervals were .14/.08/.30 and RSR prime in V1 anterior T wave
inversion. There were no acute changes. His blood smear showed no
evidence of hemolysis. There are no schistocytes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old gentleman who
is ten years status post cardiac
transplant , who presents with waxing and waning flu like illness
with fevers and left shift. Of note is hyperbilirubinemia with an
elevated LDH , in conjunction with anemia , suggestive of hemolysis
and also thrombocytopenia. It was felt that patient most likely
had an infectious process. Infectious Disease was contacted. The
patient had multiple blood cultures , sputum cultures , sputum
analyses and titers drawn with a completely negative workup , except
for E. coli noted on several sputum stains but there is no other
evidence for pneumonia. The patient was empirically treated for
several days on intravenous Cefuroxime with no change in his fever
curve , which had ranged from 100 to 102 degrees for all the days of
admission except the last 24 days of admission when patient was
afebrile. Most likely explanation for the patient&apos;s symptoms and
signs is a viral illness of unclear etiology. The fevers , joint
aches , upper respiratory symptoms all resolved by the time of
discharge. With regards to the patient&apos;s anemia , there was no
specific diagnosis made , despite extensive workup. The hematology
oncology service was consulted , and stated that the patient&apos;s
peripheral smear was normal , as it had been by our reading. They
still wanted to check a PNH screen and G6PD level in three to four
weeks following discharge for possible explanations of his
hemolytic anemia , although may be possibly related to a viral
illness as well. By the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s
hematocrit was stable at 30% and there was no further increase in
the patient&apos;s LDH or bilirubin; in fact those levels were resolving
by the time of discharge. The thrombocytopenia again may be
related to the viral illness and there is no evidence for hemolytic
uremic syndrome or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Also during
this visit , a PPD was checked and it was found that the patient was
anergic , as might be expected with all of his immunosuppressive
drug regimen. At the time of discharge , the patient was feeling
well and no longer complaining of his flu like syndrome.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , 81 mg P O q d; 2 ) Cyclo-
sporin , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 3 )
Colace , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 4 ) Vasotec , 10 mg P O b.i.d.; 5 )

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b apical
aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most recent EF
35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and fatigue.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mrs. Chepiga is a lovely 73yo woman who presented in 9/22 with 3 days of
epigastric and chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. She
subsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD. Flow through the LAD was
only TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure. Course was complicated by
post-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus.
She was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently went
home w/ weekly f/u w/ cardiac rehab. While at short term rehab , she was
treated w/ doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV. Following discharge from
rehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of &quot;dizzy spells&quot; she
was experiencing while on lasix.
She did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to have
decreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab.
She says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on the
treadmill; she hasn&apos;t been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c of
dyspnea and fatigue. This has been accompanied by new-onset PND
( occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night ) , 5 pound weight gain , and
increasing abdominal girth. She does acknowledge dietary indiscretion
this past week ( had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago ). No orthopnea.
Mrs. Bloxsom cardiac rehab. contacted Dr. Takach ( her primary
cardiologist ) a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Losey DOE and
increasing fatigue. Starting 2 days ago , she was placed on lasix 40 mg.
Since then , she has taken a total of 5 doses. She came to urgent care
this PM and was noted to desat. to 85% w/ ambulation in the setting of
fluid overload. She was subsequently admitted.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. CARDS PUMP: Volume overloaded w/ ischemic CMP implicated.
Initially received IV diuresis w/ lasix 80 mg IV bid and was ~2.5 liters
negative. SBP down to 80 following overdiuresis on 6/14 held diuresis
on 10/7 .  Resumed oral regimen w/ lasix 40 mg po qdaily on 10/5 .
Discharged on lasix 20 mg po qdaily. Continued spironolactone 25 mg po
qdaily. Increased lisinopril to 30 mg po qdaily to optimize heart
failure regimen at admission; changed to 15 mg po qdaily on 10/7 after
SBP dropped to 10/7 .  Also , she had apparently been taking this
inconsistently as well.
2. CARDS ISCHEMIA: No active issues. Recent ETT w/ small reversible
defect involving the basal inferolateral wall. Continued ASA , plavix ,
lipitor.
3. CARDS RHYTHM: W/ known ischemic cardiac disease and EF~35% ( down
to 31% on post-stress by MIBI ) , inclined for AICD placement ( MADIT ).
Discussed w/ EP and she will see Dr. Pippens as an outpatient. Repeat Echo
4/3/06 w/ estimated EF 40%. Defer decision on EP eval to primary
cardiologist Dr. Dewolf
4. PULM: Hypoxia in the setting of volume overload. Weaned O2 w/
adequate diuresis.
5. HEME: 9/22 course c/b LV thrombus , has been on
anticoagulation. Repeat echo. w/o thrombus , however apex quite akinetic
and contrast study with stagnant flow concerning for high risk of thrombus
recurrence. Therefore , warfarin was continued in addition to ASA and
plavix. The decision to continue these three medications is deferred to
pt&apos;s primary cardiologist , Dr. Navejas . Pt has INR drawn locally but is
managed by the CDMC coumadin clinic and will f/u with them.
6. ENDO: Initially on regimen of lantus , lispro , and sliding scale.
Then patient acknowledged that she had never been on insulin the past.
Switched to sliding scale alone , transferred on metformin 500 mg po bid.
7. PPX: PPI and on coumadin until discharge.

Discharge Date: 10/15/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: DIABETES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old , white
male with cardiac risk factors of
diabetes , borderline hypertension , male gender , and a positive
family history , who has no prior cardiac history , but now presents
to Leyson Memorial Hospital complaining of substernal chest
pain. Approximately six weeks ago , the patient lifted a 100-pound
bag and the next a.m. , noted substernal chest pressure without
associated symptoms. This pressure lasted approximately three to
five minutes and resolved spontaneously. Since then , the patient
has had two similar episodes of substernal chest pressure that have
occurred while he was exerting himself , once while running during a
basketball game and once again while running on the beach in
Westtpo Racecon Nari Neither episode had associated symptoms ( i.e. , radiation ,
nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , palpitations ) , and both episodes
lasted less than five minutes and resolved with rest. On the night
prior to admission , the patient was working regripping his golf
clubs and noted a pulling sensation into his chest , which again
resolved with rest. On the morning of admission , the patient awoke
at 4:00 a.m. , noting a 6-7/10 substernal chest pressure associated
with diaphoresis. The pain persisted for five hours , at which time
the patient presented to MLMC .  At KGH , the patient was found to
have a blood pressure of 152/88 and a heart rate of 76. His
physical examination was benign. However , the patient&apos;s
electrocardiogram showed new ST depressions in V2-V5 , T wave
inversions in AVL , and flat T&apos;s in 1 and V6. The patient was
treated with two sublingual nitroglycerins and sent to the Mendwood Hospital .  On route to Icoson Hospital , the patient received
two sublingual nitroglycerin sprays. On arrival , the patient&apos;s
pain had dwindled to 1/10 , without associated symptoms. The
patient&apos;s blood pressure was 126/80 , with a heart rate of 80. The
patient was treated with an aspirin , a sublingual nitroglycerin ,
nitro paste , Lopressor 5 mg x 1 intravenously , and intravenous
heparin. Upon transfer to the CCU , the patient was pain free. A
repeat electrocardiogram demonstrated resolution of ST depressions
and flat T waves , but persistence of the T wave inversion in AVL.
The patient was admitted for further treatment and to rule out
myocardial infarction. The patient gives no history of edema ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. The patient denies
fevers , upper respiratory infection symptoms , cough , abdominal
pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , or weight loss.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history is
significant for diabetes. The patient has
kidney stones , is status post procedure three to four years ago ,
and a history of sinusitis.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The patient&apos;s medications at the time of
admission included only Glyburide 2.5 mg
p.o. q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is unmarried. He was the part owner
of a bar. He does not smoke , and he does not
drink.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s mother had a myocardial infarction
in her 60&apos;s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , tan male in no
acute distress. Blood pressure , 126/80.
Heart rate , 80. Respiratory rate , 20. Temperature , 98. Oxygen
saturation , 100% on two liters. Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat
examination was anicteric , with oropharynx benign. Neck was
supple , with no lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ , with no bruits.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Back examination
demonstrated no costovertebral angle tenderness and no spinal
tenderness. Coronary examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm , distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Abdominal examination was benign. Rectal examination showed guaiac
negative stool. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema , with pulses 2+ throughout , and no femoral bruits.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient to be alert and
oriented x 3.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission revealed the
patient&apos;s electrolytes to be within normal
limits , except for a glucose of 293. The first CK returned 970 ,
with an MB fraction of 65.1. Magnesium was 1.6. CBC was within
normal limits , with a hematocrit of 44.1. Coag&apos;s were also normal
at 12.7 and 27.4. Chest x-ray showed no enlarged heart and no
infiltrate. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm , with a
rate of 60 , and no ST-T changes on the 15 of August , 1995.
However , electrocardiogram at the Bertgrand Hospital , pain free , showed normal
sinus rhythm , with a heart rate of 82 , T wave inversions , AVL , and
flat T&apos;s in lead 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of
acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram
changes were consistent with lateral or anterolateral ischemia.
His peak CK&apos;s returned at 1 , 330 , with 54.5% MB fractions. The
patient was maintained on heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin for
72 hours after admission and was started on Lopressor and
enteric-coated aspirin at admission. The patient remained chest
pain free for the five days post myocardial infarction and
underwent a submax ETT on the 5 of August , 1995. In addition , an
electrocardiogram was performed , which showed a left ventricle with
73% ejection fraction , upper limits of normal size , and a question
of inferior wall hypokinesis. On the 24 of June , the patient underwent a
submax ETT , which was stopped secondary to chest tightness , with
diagnostic electrocardiogram changes , maximal heart rate of 96 ,
blood pressure of 145/82 , electrocardiogram with 2 mm ST
depressions , persisting into recovery. Because of a positive ETT ,
the patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization , which
showed a proximal left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which was
percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to 20% residual ,
as well as a mid-left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which was
percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to a 30% residual.
The left anterior descending was found to be diffusely diseased ,
without focal stenoses , and the proximal right coronary artery
showed a 60% shelf-like lesion. The patient did not experience
chest pain or shortness of breath during the procedure. Post
cardiac catheterization/percutaneous transhepatic coronary
angioplasty , the patient was maintained on his glipizide and
atenolol , 50 mg p.o. q.d. , and enteric-coated aspirin , as well as
heparin overnight. Two days after the cardiac catheterization , the
patient underwent a second submax ETT. This he performed without
chest discomfort or electrocardiogram changes.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home on the 16 of September .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient&apos;s condition at the time of
discharge was stable.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will receive diabetic teaching as
an outpatient with CH and will follow up with
Dr. Kalert .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , sublingual
nitroglycerins p.r.n. chest pain , and
Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. q.d.

ATTENDING: LESPERANCE , RICKIE MD
PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Sick sinus syndrome.
4. Delirium.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Diabetes , newly diagnosed.
2. Chronic anticoagulation.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of GI bleed.
5. Prior CVA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Stonerock is an 89-year-old male with a history of multiple
medication problems , including hypertension , atrial fibrillation ,
sick sinus syndrome , history of colon cancer and prostate cancer ,
status post embolic stroke in 3/22 , and history of congestive
heart failure with an EF of 40-50% , who presented to the
emergency room complaining of two days of increased lethargy. At
that time , he denied cough , chest pain , shortness of breath , PND
or orthopnea. In the emergency room , the patient was found to
have a heart rate in the 120s with a new left bundle-branch
block. Carotid massage was attempted and the patient blocked to
15:1 due to sick sinus syndrome. An echocardiogram was done in
the emergency room , which revealed an EF of 25%. It was felt
that the patient was in acute congestive heart failure
exacerbation secondary to the atrial fibrillation with RVR. It
was deemed at that time too dangerous to pharmacologically
convert the patient. He was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for placement of a transvenous pacer.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Arthritis.
3. Atrial fibrillation , on anticoagulation.
4. History of prostate cancer , status post prostatectomy.

ALLERGIES:
No known allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient denies cigarette , drug or alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
The patient had a father who died at the age of 63 of a heart
attack. There is a family history of colon cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Afebrile , pulse irregular , 125; blood pressure 140/100. Pulse
oximetry was 97% on 2 liters. General: This is an elderly male
in no acute distress. Neck: Supple , no lymphadenopathy , no
thyroid enlargement , JVP at 18 cm with flutter waves. Carotids
are 2+ bilaterally. Pulmonary: Bibasilar rales.
Cardiovascular: Irregular rate and rhythm , tachycardic , S1 , S2
normal. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender
and nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. Extremities: Warm
bilaterally , 2+ pitting lower extremity edema. No clubbing or
cyanosis.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION:
Notable for mild elevation of the white blood cell count of 11.0 ,
hematocrit of 40.6 , and platelets of 218 , 000. Electrolytes were
within normal limits. The creatinine was mildly elevated at 1.3.
BNP was markedly elevated at 7931. Coagulation showed an INR of
2.9. LFTs were within normal limits. Cardiac enzymes showed a
CK of 129 , CK-MB of 5.9 , and an elevated troponin at 0.27. EKG:
Atrial flutter with RVR , rate in the 120s , and new left
bundle-branch block. Chest x-ray: Cardiomegaly and
cephalization , no acute infiltrate.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN UPON ADMISSION:
This is an 89-year-old male with a history of sick sinus
syndrome , atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin , as well as congestive
heart failure , who was admitted for atrial fibrillation/atrial
flutter with RVR , and decompensated congestive heart failure. At
the time of admission , the patient was felt to be at risk
secondary to his sick sinus syndrome and new left bundle-branch
block. He was felt to be at risk for asystole and symptomatic
bradycardia with any blocking agents. Therefore , transvenous
pacer was scheduled to be placed in the Cath Lab.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Rhythm: Shortly after admission , the patient had a temporary
ventricular pacer placed on 9/13/05 with a heart rate of less
than 50. After the procedure , the patient was admitted to the
CCU with atrial flutter with RVR and a rate in the 20s. The rate
was intermittently controlled with a combination of IV digoxin
and Lopressor. On 6/6/05 , a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker
was implanted with VVI at 50. Throughout the next two days , the
patient&apos;s heart rate continued to be difficult to control , but
improved with diltiazem. The patient was initiated on an
amiodarone load on 8/22/05 .  The following day , he converted to
normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. At that time , he continued to
be ventricularly paced , and the pacemaker was changed to DDD on
10/21/05 .  For the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm and was dual-paced without any
recurrence of arrhythmias. He will be continued on his
amiodarone load , which was 2.9 g upon discharge and we continued
for a total load of 10 g.
b. Pump: Upon admission , an echocardiogram on 5/23/05 showed
an EF of 20-25% with regional wall motion abnormalities noted in
the intraventricular septum , which was akinetic as well as global
hyperkinesis of the left ventricle. On admission , the patient
had indications of heart failure , including increased JVP and
bilateral lower extremity edema , as well as pulmonary effusions.
The patient was diuresed effectively with low-dose IV Lasix. His
admission weight was 91 kg , and upon discharge , it was
approximately 87 kg. The patient was given intermittent Lasix 10
mg IV for diuresis to maintain a negative I&amp;O of 500 mL. Upon
discharge , the patient may require continued diuresis with home
regimen of p.o. Lasix. In addition , the patient was noted to
have marked hypertension throughout his stay. Blood pressure was
occasionally difficulty to control , and at times , required IV
nitro drip. Systolic blood pressures were noted to as high as
180 and as low as 100 with IV nitro drip. The patient&apos;s blood
pressure was managed with calcium channel blocker , beta-blocker ,
as well as ACE inhibitor. Upon transfer to the cardiology floor
on 10/21/05 , the p.o. diltiazem was increased. Upon discharge ,
the patient will be continued on a home regimen of lisinopril 10
mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and diltiazem
extended release 360 mg p.o. daily. At the time of discharge ,
the patient&apos;s blood pressure was well controlled with systolic
blood pressures ranging from 110 to 120s.
c. Ischemia: Upon admission , the patient had cardiac enzyme
elevation with initially 0.27 , which elevated to a max of 1.27 on
10/23/05 .  Initially , the enzyme elevations were thought to be
secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of an elevated heart
rate and volume overload. However , the patient underwent a
cardiac catheterization on 2/25/05 which showed evidence of
coronary artery disease , two-vessel disease , specifically , there
was a LAD proximal 90% lesion as well as diffuse proximal-mid
standing 80% lesion , as well as RTLV-BR mid discrete 80% lesion
beyond the bifurcation of RPDA. On 2/25/05 , the patient had a
successful roto-ablation , angioplasty , and insertion of three
cipher DES to the LAD resulting in TIMI 2 flow. On 1/1/05 , the
patient returned to the cath lab , and at that time , he had a DES
placement at distal RCA. The patient denied a chest pain
throughout his stay. Upon discharge , he was able to ambulate
without significant dyspnea on exertion or chest discomfort.
2. Psychiatry: At the beginning of the hospital stay , the
patient was confused and somewhat agitated. His behavior was
controlled with Haldol as well as p.r.n. Ativan. The patient&apos;s
confusion and delirium improved significantly , and the Haldol and
Ativan were tapered off. Prior to discharge , he was reinitiated
on his home regimen of Zyprexa. The patient has a longstanding
history of dementia. Geriatrics consult followed in this case
and advised on titration of a Haldol.
3. Vascular: Following the cardiac catheterization , the patient
was noted to have a right femoral bruit. A vacular ultrasound
was obtained on 7/18/05 and did not show any evidence of an AV
fistula.
4. Heme: The patient is on chronic anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation. Upon admission , his INR was 2.9 and became
elevated to a supratherapeutic level. Therefore , his Coumadin
was held. The patient will be reinitiated on Coumadin when his
INR is below 2. Goal INR will be between 2 and 3.
5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and
was continued on his home dose of Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. daily.
Thyroid function tests were checked and were within normal
limits. In addition , the patient was noted to have mildly
elevated fasting blood glucoses during his admission. His blood
sugars ranged from 95 to 182. He was maintained on a regular
sliding scale insulin and required only minimal units of
supplemental insulin. A hemoglobin A1c was ordered , and the
results are still pending at this time.
6. GI: The patient was noted to have significant constipation
throughout his stay and was continued on an aggressive bowel
regimen , which included Colace , senna , lactulose , and Dulcolax.
The patient has a history of GI bleed. He was noted to have a
small amount of blood in the stools secondary to constipation ,
but this was resolved with additional bowel movements. His
hematocrit remained stable , with no signs of anemia. The patient
does have a history of colon cancer for which he underwent a
colectomy. He will be followed as an outpatient.
7. FEN: Due to the patient&apos;s heart failure , he was placed on a
2-liter fluid restriction as well as 2 g salt restriction. The
patient was continued on a low-cholesterol , low-salt diet. Due
to his mild sedation with Haldol , the patient was evaluated by
speech and swallow and initially placed on mechanical soft diet
with some honey-thick liquids. As his mental status improved
significantly , the patient was returned to a house diet ,
low-cholesterol , low-fat , with the previous salt and fluid
restrictions. The patient was continued on light scale
throughout his stay.
8. ID: The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection
based on urinalysis upon admission. His culture remained
negative throughout his stay. He was initially given
ceftriaxone. Initially , he was started on Keflex following on
pacemaker placement for antibiotic coverage , which was
discontinued on 1/12/05 .  The patient remained afebrile , with no
signs of systemic infection throughout his stay.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI. His INR
remained subtherapeutic throughout his stay.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.

Discharge Date: 11/6/1992
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK
COMPLICATED BY A LONG HISTORY OF VERTIGO.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient was in her usual state of
health until the day of admission when
she had sudden onset of increased vertigo , dizziness , and near
syncope as well as left leg weakness and dysarthria. She had a
mild frontal headache , no palpitations , no chest pain , and no
shortness of breath. These symptoms lasted two to three hours with
slow gradual improvement. She phoned her EGMC doctor who referred
her to Moness Medical Center .  On admission , she complained
of no residual symptoms. She had no visual changes , no amaurosis ,
no paresthesias or numbness , and was feeling at her baseline. Her
history , of pertinence , in 1988 , she had a syncopal episode. A
Holter at that time revealed some atrial fibrillation and
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia for which she was started on
Atenolol. In 1990 , she had a villous adenoma diagnosed and
underwent an abdominoperineal resection complicated by
post-operative atrial fibrillation. She ruled out for myocardial
infarction at that time. For the past year , she has described
intermittent episodes of dizziness , so called room spinning , and
fatigue lasting for a few minutes occurring only once a month. She
has no other significant past medical history besides hypertension.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies. She is a non-smoker
and non-drinker. She is a French speaking woman who lives alone
with a number of family members nearby. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: She
was on Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant French speaking elderly
woman in no acute distress. Vital signs
showed her to be afebrile , blood pressure 160/80 lying down , 160/80
sitting up , pulse 70 lying down with pulse 76 sitting , and
respiratory rate 16. HEENT: Examination showed normal cranium ,
atraumatic , extraocular movements intact , and pupils equal , round ,
and reactive to light. She had bilateral cataracts detected and
her oropharynx was clear and within normal limits. NECK: She had
no jugular venous distention , neck was supple , she had full range
of motion , and her carotids were 1+ bilaterally with good upstroke.
No bruits were appreciated. LUNGS: Clear bilaterally. No spinal
or costovertebral angle tenderness appreciate. CARDIAC:
Examination showed rate and rhythm were regular , S1 and S2 , an S4
was appreciated , and no S3 with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur.
ABDOMEN: She had a colostomy , her abdomen was soft and non-tender ,
positive bowel sounds , and no masses. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema. No rashes were appreciated. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination was non-focal. She was alert and oriented times three
and cranial nerves II-XII were within normal limits. Motor
examination showed 5/5 strength with no pronator drift and sensory
examination was grossly within normal limits. Deep tendon reflexes
were 1+ bilaterally and symmetric with downgoing toes and
finger-to-nose was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 107 ,
bicarbonate 22 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.2 ,
and glucose 123. Hematocrit was 38.2% , white count 11.2 with a
normal differential , and platelets were 291. PT was 12.9 and PTT
was 24.3. Admission CK was 50. Urinalysis revealed 60-80 white
blood cells , no red blood cells , and 1+ squamous epithelium in the
sediment. Portable chest X-Ray was within normal limits except for
a tortuous aorta and admission EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 58 ,
intervals 0.18/0.09/0.44 , an axis of negative 21 degrees , there was
evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria , and a
flipped T wave in III which was new compared with an EKG of February
1990. There were no acute ST changes. Head CT on admission
revealed an old lacune in the right internal capsule , some
paraventricular white matter low density changes with evidence of a
lacunar infarct in her right cerebellum which was of indeterminant
age.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this was a
75 year old white female with a history of
hypertension and a history of atrial fibrillation , non-sustained ,
who presents with a two to three hour episode of vertigo and left
sided weakness which spontaneously resolved. She was admitted for
further evaluation of this transient ischemic attack thought to be
due either a vertebovascular insufficiency syndrome , anterior
circulation , carotid stenosis , or an embolus from a cardiac source.
Neurology was consulted and , in addition , she was entered on a rule
out protocol for a myocardial infarction. Her abnormal urinalysis
was also of concern despite her lack of symptoms and she was
afebrile. Repeat urinalysis was ordered and urine was sent for
culture and sensitivity. Hospital course over the next few days ,
the patient remained completely asymptomatic except for an
occasional complaint of mild palpitations , occasional vertigo , and
occasional frontal headache. She was started on Coumadin on
hospital day number two for which she entered therapeutic range by
hospital day number four. On hospital day number two , she had a
Holter placed which showed normal sinus rhythm for 24 hours except
for one five-beat run of ventricular tachycardia and two episodes
of atrial fibrillation/flutter , the longest lasting thirteen beats.
On hospital day number two , she had an echocardiogram which showed
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of
thrombus or valvular disease. On hospital day number four , she had
a carotid non-invasive study which revealed completely patent
carotid arteries without evidence of stenosis or atherosclerotic
lesions. On hospital day number five , she had a magnetic resonance
imaging of her head with angiogram , the results of which were
pending at the time of discharge. After being hospitalized for
five days , the patient was completely stable in therapeutic range
on Coumadin without focal neurologic findings and without obvious
source of her transient ischemic attack beyond a mild transient
arrhythmia. Therefore , she was discharged with instructions to
follow-up with her regular TH physician for continued monitoring
of her Coumadin dosing and PT levels as well as long-term
instructions for follow-up care.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 63-year-old right-handed lady with history of stage III
non-small-cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy ,
history of right MCA stroke status post right CEA on 3/1/06 for
70% stenosis of the right ICA , question history of right temporal
lobe epilepsy , who was readmitted to the medicine service from
her nursing home for question of altered mental status , fever ,
and cough. The patient was recently admitted from 2/24/06 to
1/5/06 for change in mental status , treated for presumed UTI
but grew with yeast but no bacteria. The patient was consulted
by neurology for increased somnolence. She had a head CT at that
time that shows encephalomalacia in right MCA distribution
consistent with old stroke with no acute intracranial
hemorrhages , midline shifts , or mass effect. No definite
metastatic lesions were observed. Per patient&apos;s oncologist , her
response to treatment has been excellent. She has a negative
EEG. MRI/MRA always shows the right MCA infarct. Normal B12 ,
folate , TSH , and RPR. Neurology at that time agreed that no
further evaluation of somnolence is necessary at this time and
leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given her lack of neurological
finding. The patient was then transferred to rehab on 1/5/06 .
Per nursing and discussion with house staff , the patient has had
waxing and waning mental status and at times appearing alert and
appropriate and other times somewhat hallucinating and agitated.
She also had periods of cough and fever and pain on urination.
According to the son , she has had a cough for the last 10 days
prior to admission. She has not been eating adequately with food
sticking out from her mouth and not quite responsive. She had a
chest x-ray done on 7/26/06 that shows a right hilar mass and
right upper lobe infiltrate. She was started on moxifloxacin 400
mg p.o. daily on 7/26/06 and then she was transferred here at
Kendertawn Community Hospital at the son&apos;s request for change in mental
status , cough , and fever and presumed pneumonia.
In the ED , her temperature was 98.8 , pulse 122 , blood pressure
160/68 , breathing at 20. She got vancomycin , levofloxacin , and 4
L of fluids. Chest x-ray was consistent with right upper lobe
pneumonia , question of postobstructive pneumonia. Her UA was
quite dirty with oxalate crystal , yeast , and 100+ white blood
cells. She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for
presumed pneumonia and UTI. Her head CT was negative for any
acute change but also shows chronic right MCA infarct. The
patient was transferred to the floor for further management.

acute change , chronic right MCA infarct. Echo , trace MR , EF
55-60% , known LV function with diastolic dysfunction.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 64-year-old right-handed woman with history of stage
III non-small-cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy ,
history of right ICA stroke status post right RCA 3/1/06 ,
recent hospitalization for change in mental status and UTI who
was admitted from nursing home for altered mental status , fever ,
and cough and dysuria. Found to have pyuria with calcium oxalate
crystal , new right upper lobe opacity concerning for
postobstructive pneumonia. Her head CT was unchanged. The
patient was admitted for presumed pneumonia and UTI.
ID: The patient has elevated white blood cell count bandemia in
the setting of right upper lobe opacity concerning for
postobstructive pneumonia and also with pyuria with yeast. The
patient received vancomycin and levofloxacin in the ED. She was
briefly put on vancomycin and levofloxacin and added Flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia. She subsequently also switched over to
vancomycin , Ceptaz , and Flagyl to cover for pseudomonas. Her
urine culture grew out yeast and her blood culture was negative
to date. Her antibiotic regimen was changed back to
levofloxacin , Flagyl on p.o. regimen. On postoperative day #4 ,
she was improving. She did have one brief episode of
hypertension on hospital day #2 that responded to IV fluids. She
has required no escalation in antibiotics and tolerated
levofloxacin and Flagyl quite well. She will continue her
levofloxacin and Flagyl for an additional 14 days. She also got
a chest CT that shows right upper lobe pneumonia and also
question of consolidation in right lung with underlying
emphysema. The consolidation is contiguous with the right hilum
and underlying hilar adenopathy or hilar mass cannot be excluded.
She also has small right pleural effusion. The findings were
discussed with Dr. Szufat who is her oncologist and he felt that
she is likely having post XRT changes and no further workup is
necessary for now. She will continue to finish her course of
antibiotics of p.o. levofloxacin and Flagyl for 14 days.
Urology: Her UTI shows yeast. Given that the fact that she has
multiple episodes of yeast UTI currently , she was treated with
fluconazole for three days.
Neuro: She has changes in mental status waxing and waning ,
however , the patient&apos;s mental status has greatly improved
throughout her hospital stay although with occasional episode of
hallucinations. For example she was thinking that the resident
is her niece. Psych , onch , and geriatrics was asked to see the
patient at the son&apos;s request. Both psy onc and geriatrics
believed that her change in mental status is multifactorial , and
is likely a result of delirium rather than dementia. They
recommended avoiding pain meds and oversedating meds and started
her on zyprexa 5mg bid , 2.5mg bid prn agitation , and can increase
to 10mg po qhs if necessary for agitation. She was continued on
her Lamictal and Cymbalta and has no further neurological
decompensation. Her Seroquel was decreased to 50 mg b.i.d.
p.r.n. and Zydis 5 mg p.o. p.r.n. , however , she was not receiving
these medications as she was not agitated. She had one dose of
seroquel on 3/11 early am and got really over sedated. Seroquel
was d/c and patient should not be receiving seroquel in the
future for risk of oversedation. Her vitals were stable
throughout.
CV: History of controlled prolonged QTC on Haldol. Her Haldol
was DC&apos;d last admission , is now on Zyprexa and Seroquel. Her
EKGs were stable throughout her hospital stays.
Heme/Onch: The patient has history of stage III non-small-cell
lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy and is followed by
her outpatient oncologist , Dr. Miquel Grothe , at the Nawin Tayjeune Antri- Community Hospital as well as the outpatient psycho/onch social
worker whose name is Dr. Hugh Dress . The patient was seen by
psych/onch and geriatric. Dr. Kiel stated that she does not
have any further chemotherapy treatment planned for the future.
He will evaluate her when he sees her again in clinic. She is
not currently at the best medical condition to receive any
further therapy.
Endocrine: She was given NovoLog sliding scale for diabetes and
levothyroxine for history of Graves&apos; and history of radioiodine
ablation.
FEN: the patient was seen by speech and swallow for question of
dysphagia and difficulty with swallowing and eating. The
patient&apos;s video flow examination shows prolonged oral phase , but
she did well on the rest of her video swallow examination so she
was put on a mince ground diet and thin liquids. Alternate
liquids and solids with tongue sweep to remove oral cavity
residue. The patient recommended to sit upright to take small
bites and sips. She should be seen by speech and swallow for
follow up swallow treatments two to three times per week. She
also was given nutrition consult who started the calorie counts.
Nutrition recommended that she may be need long-term nutritional
therapy if she does not meet her nutritional goal. That will be
deferred to her outpatient doctors at a later time. She will
need assists and encouragement with feeding. She was also given
Nexium for prophylaxis and replete her lytes with an American
Diabetic Diet with low salt. She was given Lovenox and PPI for
prophylaxis.

ADDENDUM
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , CAD status post MI in 2000 who presented with an ST
elevation MI to the Emergency Room on 8/23/06 .  He was brought
to Cath where he was found to have in-stent thrombosis in his LAD. The clot was
aspirated and bare-metal stent was placed in his LAD
and another stent was placed in his diag-2. He suffered multiple V-Tach
cardiac arrests requiring CPR and cardioversion. In the
Cath Lab , he was given bicarb , placed on the epi drip , given
Lasix and was intubated. He was thought to aspirate at the time
of intubation secondary to vomiting. A bedside echo revealed
global hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He , at that time , was
placed on a balloon pump , dopamine 16 , amio 1 , propofol 1 , and
Integrilin and brought to the CCU. On the floor , his blood
pressures were difficult to control and his PA catheter readings
indicated a wedge pressure of 47. His MAPs were marginal and max dopamine , max
Levophed , epinephrine and dobutamine were required to maintain a minimal blood
pressure.
His family was aware of his prognosis and was there at the time
of his arrest at 3:30 in the morning. CPR was initiated , and
ACLS was performed until the family decided to terminate the ACLS. At that
time , there were no spontaneous breath sounds , no heart sounds , and nonreactive
pupils. The cause of death was thought to be cardiogenic shock
secondary to ST elevation MI. His time of death was 3:47 a.m. on 8/23/06 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
82 y.o. femalew tih long hx of hereditary angioedema- s/p multiple
remote prior tracheostomies due to airway edema- now admitted with lip
swelling. In recent years , her primary symptoms have been GI in
nature- with bowel swelling/ N/V/abdominal pain. Has been maintained
on stanazol previously , but on danazol for the last several years.
Patient had a recent admission for LGIB - outpatient elective
colonoscopy ultimately showed a stricture which was dilated. She had
persistent GI symptoms which were thought likely due to an angioedema
attack and her danazol was increased to 200 bid. In the last week ,
patient was in the midst of tapering this medication down with her
Allergist Dr. Petite , but has now developed upper lip swelling on day
of admission- which appeared to be worsening in the ED.
PMHx: notable for colonic strictures , DVT s/p IVC filter , ?DM , HTN ,
afib , CAD s/p MI , s/p sigmoid colostomy.
Long list of allergies including IV contrast , PCN , levaquin.
Meds include danazole 100 QD.
On exam , - afebrile , 99%ra , bp 105/80 , hr 80s. sitting up comfortably ,
able to speak with slightly muddled pronouncitation. Left upper lip
swelling to twice size of normal right side. No uvula swelling noted.
No stridor or increased secreations. Lungs clear. Irregular heart rate
with 3/6 HSM at LLSB. Faint crackles at bases. No rashes noted.
Labs remarkable only for Cr 1.2 ( basline ). Normal CBC , Normal coags.
C1Q/c4/c2/c1 esterase inhibitor results all pending.
Impression/Hospital course:
82 y.o. F with heriditary angioedema , presenting with lip swelling.
Patient was admitted to CCU for observation in case of airway
instability. She was treated with higher dose danazol ( 200 tid ) as well
as FFP ( for which she was premedicated with benadryl ). FFP replaces
C1 esterase inhibitor. She required single dose of IV lasix to maintain
I/O status during FFP infusion. She had rapid improvement over 24-48
hours with no signs of airway compromise. She will be followed closely
by her allergist and will leave on a higher dose of danazol. There is
some consideration of re-instituting stanazol in the future.

ALLERGIES:
Lisinopril and atenolol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes chronic venous stasis ulcers in lower extremities ,
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , asthma , sarcoid , restricted
pulmonary disease , and obesity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic venous
stasis ulcers of bilateral lower extremities admitted to the Plastic
Surgery service with infection on 11/9/05 .  The patient was
treated with IV vancomycin and levofloxacin and the patient has
been afebrile during the stay. She has been getting dressing
changes with acetic acid solution three times a day on her lower
extremity ulcers bilaterally. Over the course of the days the
ulcer looks pretty clean and very nice and she has been doing
very good. Her pain is well controlled and she has been treated
with the bed rest , IV antibiotics , and the dressing changes. She
has been told to keep her legs elevated most of the time , so that
the swelling will decrease , and the patient has been afebrile
with the stabe vital signs. She has been taking p.o. and been
voiding. She has been ambulating independently from bed to bath
and chair and her pain has been well controlled. The lower
extremity wounds are getting well and there is no evidence of any
purulent discharge or evidence of infection. While the patient
was here , her vancomycin and levofloxacin have been discontinued
and the patient is switched to Bactrim double strength as the
wound culture revealed Achromobacter and xylosoxidans , which was
sensitive. The patient will be discharged to home today with the
visiting nurse and services. The patient will return back in
several weeks for the further reconstruction and wound culture
most probably skin grafting.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
74 yo woman in remission from Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma
and s/p renal transplant( 1/20 ) who p/w hypoxia , low grade fever in
setting of colonoscopy under general anesthesia. Pt had PET scan on
4/3 which showed uptake in asc colon and hep
flexure concerning for malignancy. CT colonoscopy
showed 1.6 les in desc colon and colonoscopy under
GA performed due to difficulty of going beyond
hep flexure. Pt had hypoxia to 80s when
awakening from anesthesia. Temp to 101.1. CXR showed
?LLL opacity. Thought to be likely Pneumonitis vs. asp PNA. In Pacu
Pt also had EKG changes , TWIs and ? BBB assoc
with HR70s-80s. EKGs resolved when rate in 60s.
Physical Exam revealed AOOx3 woman in NAD. PERRL. No carotid bruits.
Cardiac exam remarkable for RRR , 2/6 murmur at RUSB. There are
crackles at LL base to mid lung field. Abd exam there is
rebound and invol guarding. Tenderness in epigastric
and suprapubic area. +BS. No hepatomegaly.
Labs significant for HCt 24 from baseline of 30 , Cr
1.9 from baseline of 1.6. Cardiac enzymes were flat.
HOSPITAL COURSE:****************
1. Pulm-On floor pt&apos;s oxygenation improved within one day to 96% on RA
Likely aspiration , but final read on
CXR shows no infiltrate/opacity. Levo/Flagyl given empirically x 5days
though she remained afeb.
2. CV-Pt has h/o MI , RCA stent , mod AS. Low Hct and EKG changes
concerning for
myocardial injury. Her cardiac enzymes were negative after the initial
hypoxic episode , and EKG changes resolved. Transfused 2u PRBCs. On
4/23 she had Afib with RVR to 130s with chest arm pain which is her
anginal equivalent. ECG with rate related ischemia ST depression
V5-6 , L. +Minimal troponin leak to 0.19 , which subseq downtrended
with nl CK. She was init treated with lopressor 5mg
IV but had hypotension to 80&apos;s which resolved quickly with IVF. She was
eventually rate controlled with dilt drip. She returned to sinus
rhythm within the day. Cards c/s&apos;d
and recommended amio load. She had PFT&apos;s , LFT&apos;s and TFT&apos;s prior to
d/c. Plan to follow up with Dr. Lenberg . Consider anticoagulation for
PAF , this is at least 2nd episode. Pt to restart ecasa 5d p colonosco
py.
2. GI-Pt had abd exam concerning for focal peritoneal
irritation. It is likely that she had a microperforation during
colonoscopy as CT showed fluid in pelvis and she had Hct drop
requiring 2U pRBC. Her exam improved , and she was tolerating PO well
at the time of discharge. She has been afeb and well appearing for
several days prior to d/c. Plan to complete 5d abx. As per Dr. Thorburn
her colonoscopy was complex , and she had polypectomy of 2.5 cm polyp.
Path is pending. If + for cancer , the base looked &quot;clean&quot; , so may be
feasible to re-scope her for surveillance at a later time , as per GI.
3. HEME- Hct after colonoscopy went to
24 ( baseline 30 ); post-transfusion HCt of 30.
5. s/p Renal transplant. Continuing meds.

Discharge Date: 10/17/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41-year-old male
who presented to the Emergency Room
complaining of blue right toes. The patient has no known vascular
disease. Over the past two years , the patient has developed
progressive claudication. He currently is able to walk about one
block before having to stop. He was otherwise well until about one
and a half weeks prior to admission when , for two days after
cutting his toenails , he noted increasing pain and blue coloring of
his right fifth toe. He thought that he injured the toe when
cutting the nail. He cut the skin on the plantar side of the right
third toe accidently five days prior to admission. He then
presented with blue coloration of the third , fourth and fifth toes
and intense pain over the fifth toe. He has no history of erythema
extending up his foot or leg. He has no history of diabetes. No
fever or chills. No history of atrial arrhythmias. No heart
disease , syncopal episodes. No low back or buttock pain. No
erectile dysfunction. He has no history of an abdominal aortic
aneurysm. He is a smoker with two packs for 20 years. No history
of hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. He had no history of TIA ,
CVA , myocardial infarction or angina. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Varicose veins. MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG
ALLERGIES.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed the patient to be
afebrile and stable. Head exam was normal.
Neck exam was supple with full range of motion. Lungs were clear
bilaterally. Heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1
and S2 , no CVA tenderness. Abdomen was obese , soft , no palpable
masses , normal bowel sounds. Groin showed no hernias. Pulses were
significant for 1+ dopplerable femorals bilaterally , 2+
dopplerable dorsalis pedis bilaterally , 1+ dopplerable posterior
tibial on the right , 2+ dopplerable posterior tibial on the left
and 2+ dopplerable popliteals. Rectal exam was guaiac positive
with some pain and no visible lesions. ABI was .66 of the dorsalis
pedis on the right , .44 of the dorsalis pedis on the left; .61
posterior tibial on the right and .66 posterior tibial on the left.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for intravenous
heparinization. He underwent an angiogram which
showed 90% stenosis of the iliac bifurcation on the right , greater
than 50% narrowing of the distal common iliac and diffuse narrowing
throughout the vessel. His SFA and popliteals were patent on the
right. On the left he had occlusion of the left common iliac with
reconstruction of the common femoral. His SFA was occluded
proximally with reconstitution at the adductor canal and one vessel
peroneal run off. His post angio creatinine was 1.1. Cardiology
was consulted and their impression was that he had severe bilateral
peripheral vascular disease with a question of an embolic event to
the right toe. They recommended that if surgery became necessary
that he had perioperative Nitropaste and check postoperative EKG&apos;s
and enzymes. He was sent home for follow-up in the clinic.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Vasotec , 5 mg
po q day; aspirin , one tablet per day; Nicorette gum
for smoking cessation.

well female. The lungs were clear to auscultation. Heart was a
regular rate and rhythm , with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Pulses
were 2+ in the radial and dorsalis pedis. Abdomen: Soft , obese ,
nontender , with some mild incisional tenderness over the area of
the appendectomy scar. Neurological examination was nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT: Was a 37 year old female with pain in the old
appendectomy scar. The plan was for an incisional hernia repair
and exploration.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
8/6/90 .  The procedure performed was an
incisional hernia repair by Dr. Cartmill and Dr. Borza . The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the floor that

to mobilize. She has complained of some nausea and some pain in
the abdomen. She was given a PCA pump for the pain. The patient
on 10/28/90 developed marked pain and much difficulty ambulating.
Minimal p.o. intake was thought to be going on at this time. On
10/15/90 , the patient began to be doing much better. She had slow
ambulating despite the PCA pump , but was felt by Dr. Kabel that the
patient would continue to improve , and we could increase the p.o.
medications and switch to a plan for discharge tomorrow.

February of 1998 , who presented with right foot pain and
nonhealing ulcers of the right second and third metatarsal joint.
She underwent angiogram on August , 1999 which revealed right
lower extremity patent superficial femoral artery , a 90 percent
distal popliteal stenosis , and three vessel occlusion distal to the
trifurcation , and a 70 percent stenosis of the distal anterior
tibial supplying the dorsalis pedis. The left femoral peroneal had
a long segmented stricture at the level of the knee. Retrograde
filling of the left dorsalis pedis was identified. The patient
presented for surgical management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 2.
Atrial fibrillation. 3. History of deep venous thrombosis. 4.
Peripheral vascular disease. 5. Status post right hip fracture
surgery. 6. Status post suprapubic total abdominal hysterectomy.
7. Status post left superficial femoral artery to peroneal bypass
graft. 8. History of diabetic nephropathy.
MEDICATIONS: 1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Humulin 10 in the
morning 6 in the p.m. 3. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. 4. MVI one

Coumadin. 10. Lovenox 30 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin and
Levofloxacin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a hard of hearing elderly
woman lying comfortably in bed. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation. Her heart had an irregular rhythm with no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. The abdomen was soft , round , non-tender ,
nondistended , bowel sounds were present. Extremities of the
extremities identified superficial ulcers between the right second
and third metatarsals. Vascular examination , on the right side the
right femoral pulse was palpable , popliteal was 2+ dopplerable ,
dorsalis pedis was 1+ dopplerable , and posterior tibial could not
be dopplered. On the left , the femoral pulse was 2+ palpable ,
popliteal was 2+ palpable , the dorsalis pedis had a biphasic
dopplerable signal , and the posterior tibial had a monophasic
dopplerable signal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On March , 1999 , the patient was brought to
the Operating Room where she underwent a right below the knee
popliteal to anterior tibial bypass with a reversed cephalic vein
graft. She also underwent vein patch angioplasty of the left
femoral tibial artery bypass graft. Her postoperative pulse
examination identified a palpable right dorsalis pedis and a
dopplerable right posterior tibial; left dopplerable dorsalis pedis
and left dopplerable posterior tibial. The patient was ruled out
for myocardial infarction as per the recommendations of the
Cardiology team. Verapamil and digoxin were continued for
appropriate rate control. On postoperative day number one it was
noted that her right arm from which the cephalic vein graft had
been harvested was edematous , and the distal extremity was somewhat
cool. With elevation this resolved. Her digital perfusion was
excellent by clinical examination , and her neurologic function was
intact. The patient was restarted on her Coumadin on postoperative
day number two. Physical Therapy consultation was obtained and
recommended that the patient be discharged to a rehabilitation
hospital to return to her baseline functionable mobility. On
September , 1999 , the patient was discharged to Rehabilitation.
The patient will be discharged to Rehabilitation in stable
condition.

****HOSPITAL COURSE****
Patient was admitted for difficulty for ambulation and work up of her
leg pains. She had two pain syndromes ( 1 ) focal area of induration 2cm
above right medial malleolus with slight warmth but not true redness
or swelling. Likely chronic venous stasis vs. superficial
thrombophlebitis. DDimer was &lt;500 and negative. This improved with
tylenol and though cellulitis was considered she was afebrile , nl WBC
count , and it did not have the clinical signs consistent with
cellulitis. Regardless it should be followed for progression. Also
considered atypical gout and this should be considered in the future if
it persists.
( 2 ) Pt complained of right sided aching lower extremity pain that was
present with ambulation. Xrays of the right lower extremity joints
including hip , knee , ankle , and LE bones showed no abnormality. She
was evaluated by physical therapy which recommended use of her cane
and that she did not have acute PT needs. Cleared to go home. Her pains
were treated with tylenol 650mg po q6hr ATC and PRN ibuprofen. The day
after admission her pain had improved and she was ambulating at baseline
with decreased discomfort. She was maintained on her outpatient
cardiovascular medications. Notably she was hypertensive but her
medications were not altered. Her BP should be followed up as an
outpatient and he BP meds titrated as needed.
She was discharged in stable condition to her son. Her NP Ezekiel Boyton
was contacted to continue follow up care. ( 479-149-2464 )
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take tylenol at least twice daily to help improve you leg pain.
Seek medical attention if your leg becomes more red , swollen , or tender ,
or if you have any fevers , or if you have any new problems with your leg.

Discharge Date: 9/16/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CELLULITIS.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Fennessy is a 47-year-old woman with stage I
breast cancer admitted for spontaneous cellulitis
of the left breast.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presented last year with
left breast mass approximately 4 cm ,
moderately aggressive histology , but was node negative and ERPR
negative. The cancer was continued T-2 , N-0 , M-0 and was treated
with lumpectomy , XRT , and four cycles of CAF ending 11/27 .  She
suffered significant skin breakdown from the radiation therapy but
improved by 11/16 .  She represented in 6/20 with two areas of
erythema with underlying lumps in the outer margin of her left
breast. At the time , it had the appearance of inflammatory breast
cancer , but a biopsy turned out to be negative for cancer. She was
treated with three days of nafcillin intravenously in the hospital ,
starting in 7/19 and has been on oral dicloxacillin since then , so
that she could take antibiotics at home. Her skin changes have
waxed and waned since then so that some physicians involved in her
care felt there was improvement in her clinical condition , although
the patient subjectively felt there was none.
More recently , the patient&apos;s breast has swollen considerably and
the overlying skin has become erythematous and the erythema has
spread to involve the entire breast and around to the back. She
denies any fevers or chills , but she feels generally ill which had
never been an issue for her. She also reported new left-sided
chest wall discomfort.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Left breast cancer as above; ( 2 ) Type II
diabetes mellitus for 1-2 years , currently
well controlled with diet and exercise. The patient takes her
blood sugars frequently and states that her sugars are usually
round 100. ( 3 ) Hypothyroidism diagnosed two years ago; ( 4 ) Low back
pain secondary to a motor vehicle accident around a year ago , not
currently an active issue; ( 5 ) Congenital partial left upper limb;
( 6 ) Depression related to her cancer.
MEDICATIONS: Dicloxacillin 500 mg q.i.d.; Synthroid 150 mcg q.d.;
Paxil 40 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives by herself with no significant
family to support or close friends since her
breast cancer diagnosis. She is a former private chef but lost her
job secondary to her cancer and spent all of her savings on medical
cost , because she had no insurance. Now the patient is no Medicare
and disability which is presently her only source of income. No
history of alcohol or tobacco use or abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY: One great aunt on her maternal side with breast
cancer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant only for very unusually heavy
menstrual periods since her chemotherapy ,
bleeding often for 10-14 days.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS - Temp 97.8 , heart rate 88 and
regular , BP 118/92 , oxygen saturation 97% on
room air. GENERAL - The patient is a pleasant woman lying in no
acute distress. HEENT - Oropharynx unremarkable. NECK - JVP at
sternal angle , no lymphadenopathy , no thyromegaly. CHEST - Lungs
clear to auscultation and percussion except for coarse inspiratory
breath sounds over her left scapula. HEART - Normal heart sounds ,
regular rate and rhythm , with no murmurs or rubs. ABDOMEN - Normal
bowel sounds. The patient had a scar in her left upper quadrant
from an old excisional biopsy. BREASTS - Diffuse erythema and
slight peau d&apos;orange appearance over the entire left breast with
slight erythema over the left nipple , with no nipple discharge. No
masses or axillary lymph nodes appreciated. EXTREMITIES -
Congenital left partial upper extremity with upper extremity
missing below mid upper arm.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on vancomycin and
cefotaxime. There was concern that the skin
changes may have been due to prior radiation , especially given its
distribution in the back. However , the Radiation/Oncology Service
saw and followed Ms. Deluccia over the course of this admission and
felt very strongly that the changes were not consistent with prior
radiation therapy. Further workup consisted of a bone scan which
was negative , a chest CAT scan which revealed only thick skin on
the left breast , no adenopathy , and minimal lung fibrosis. Of note
is that the patient had no fever or elevated white count over the
course of this admission. The patient had an ultrasound of her
left breast performed prior to her discharge , which revealed a
small fluid collection in the lateral margin of her left breast.
Serosanguineous fluid was aspirated from the collection and gram
stain of the fluid revealed no polys and no organisms. Culture of
the fluid showed no growth on discharge.
Prior to her discharge , a large IV line was placed in order to
continue IV antibiotics at home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Ancef 1 gm IV q.8h. x14 days;
( 2 ) Synthroid 115 mcg p.o. q.a.m.; ( 3 ) Paxil
40 mg p.o. q.a.m.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: To home.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

************
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Neuro: Weakness/pain on left hip flexion , L side
only decr sensation in medial L2 distribution. Pt had MRI
and spine CT showing density most c/w hematoma.
2 ) ID - His elevated white count suggested possible
infectious etiology , eg. epidural abscess versus septic joint vs.
subq abcess , but no significant fluid in the joint.

Discharge Date: 11/10/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary edema.
This is a 51 year-old female with fibromyalgia , hypertension and
migraine headaches. She reports two months of dyspnea at night ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. Over the past two
weeks prior to admission , the episodes have been becoming worse.
On the day of admission , she had an episode of severe substernal
chest pressure associated with shortness of breath after carrying
water bottles from her car. She presented to the Emergency Room
for evaluation. In the Emergency Department , V/Q scan was very low
probability. She had lower extremity noninvasive studies which
were also unremarkable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Fibromyalgia , hypertension , mild asthma ,
osteoarthritis of the knee , migraines , total
abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , chronic
fatigue syndrome , deep venous thrombosis in the right lower
extremity , history of gallstones. Medications on admission
included Nortriptyline , methyldopa , hydrochlorothiazide , Zantac ,
estrogen , Advil , ALternaGEL.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She works as a supervisor to home health aides.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient smokes one and one-half packs per
day for 30 years.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.4 , respiratory rate 22 ,
heart rate 100 , blood pressure 150/90.
HEENT: Anicteric. LUNGS: In the Emergency Room were notable for
bibasilar crackles about one-quarter of the way up.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. II/VI systolic murmur.
No rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Benign. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in
the Emergency Department. EXTREMITIES: 1+ pedal edema
bilaterally , right greater than left. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 41.6 , BUN 13 , creatinine
0.6. Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , no ischemic
changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out
myocardial infarction. She had serial CPKs which
were all negative. At that point , her monitor was then
discontinued. The patient&apos;s pulmonary edema was treated with two
doses of intravenous Lasix ( 20 milligrams each ). This resulted in
a moderate diuresis and resolution of her shortness of breath
symptoms. She then underwent an exercise test. This was done with
arm ergometry ( 30 watts ). She went ten minutes , stopped secondary
to arm fatigue. Her heart rate went from 100 to 129 , blood
pressure went from 130 systolic to 172. Electrocardiogram showed
no ischemic changes. She had no chest pain or chest pressure with
this and this was deemed a negative test. She then underwent an
echocardiogram which showed vigorous systolic function of 86% , no
valvular lesions , no wall motion abnormalities. There was evidence
of thickening in her ventricular walls.
Given the fact that the patient had an elevated diastolic pressure
and did show some early evidence of thickening in her ventricular
walls , the decision was then made to begin her on a calcium channel
blocker. Verapamil 240 milligrams p.o. q.d. was initiated and the
patient tolerated this prior to discharge. This was added in
addition to all her usual medications. She was discharged to home
in good condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Verapamil SR 240 milligrams p.o. q.d.;
Zantac 300 milligrams q.d.; estrogen 1.25
milligrams q.d.; Advil 800 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.;
hydrochlorothiazide 25 milligrams p.o. q.d.; methyldopa 250
milligrams q.d.; Nortriptyline 125 milligrams p.o. q.h.s.
The patient has scheduled an appointment to see a new primary
physician , Dr. Kenneth Finneran at Dowsna Medical Center .  She
states that appointment is scheduled for April , 1996.

Discharge Date: 7/11/2004
ATTENDING: FREDRIC HILARIO MALICK MD
SERVICE: Vascular Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with a
complicated past medical history notable for CVA and peripheral
vascular disease with chronic nonhealing foot ulcers. Patient
was seen a week prior to her current admission in Vascular Clinic
for evaluation of nonhealing ulcers of the right foot and was
subsequently scheduled for a right lower extremity angiogram with
subsequent debridement planned shortly thereafter. Two days
prior to admission , however , the staff at her rehabilitation
facility noted increasing erythema in the area of her ulcer
associated with increased complaints of pain from the patient.
Patient was subsequently referred to Alstead Medical Emergency Department for further evaluation and
management on 10/5/2004 .

SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient previously lived with husband. Patient
has been wheelchair-dependent for the past four weeks due to her
chronic ulcers. Smokes 1-2 packs per day until approximately
four weeks prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: Afebrile.
Heart rate 66 , blood pressure 110/48 , breathing 18 , satting 98%
on room air. Patient was noted to be in moderate distress
secondary to discomfort of her right lower extremity with
associated spasm and foot pain. Patient&apos;s lungs were noted to be
clear to auscultation bilaterally. A well-healed right CEA scar
was noted on the patient&apos;s neck. Patient&apos;s heart was noted to
have a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Patient&apos;s abdomen was noted to be soft , nondistended and
nontender. Extremity exam demonstrated a right leg with severe
knee contracture and spasm. The left side was noted to be
normal. The left foot was noted to have two small clean ulcers ,
one on the medial bunion and one on the tip of the medial great
toe. The right foot was noted to have a large dark necrotic
pressure wound on the lateral aspect and plantar aspect of the
mid foot , an open infected-appearing ulcer was noted on the
medial forefoot with surrounding erythema and a greenish exudate
of film. Pulse exam demonstrated 2+ pulses in bilateral
carotids , radials , and femorals. Right popliteal biphasic
Doppler pulses noted. No pulses were able to be distinguished in
the right foot. The left foot was noted to have biphasic signals
in the DP and PT by Doppler.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 101 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 74.
ALT was 36 , AST 33 , alk phos 173 , total bili 0.3 , albumin 4.0.
White blood cell count was 9.6 , hematocrit 36.2 , and platelets
232. PT 13.4 , PTT 28.1 , INR 1.0. Chest x-ray demonstrated a
mild interstitial disease with multiple old right rib fractures.
X-ray of the feet demonstrated bilateral osteopenia with no
evidence of osteomyelitis in either foot. EKG was noted to be
normal with a normal sinus rhythm at 63.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery
Service on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. She
was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime with
wet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. The
patient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid for
previously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to be
discontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  An angiogram
performed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliac
occlusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internal
and external iliac vessels. A distal stenosis of the external
iliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. The
patient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the access
site but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.
Following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , the
patient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremity
DP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration of
her hospital course. On hospital day #3 , the patient was brought
to the operating room for debridement of her right foot. For a
detailed description of the patient&apos;s operative procedure , please
the relevant operative note. Patient tolerated the procedure
well and during the procedure , the patient&apos;s ulcer base was found
to be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , and
therefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. The
patient&apos;s great toe was left in place with moderate debridement
of the deep tissues. The ulcers on the lateral right foot were
not debrided at this time. Following her procedure , the patient
was empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Her
operative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staph
which was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. At this
point , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only and
was continued on VAC therapy through postoperative day #3. At
this point , the patient&apos;s VAC dressing was changed to demonstrate
a well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulation
tissue and no signs of wound necrosis. The patient remained in
stable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , she
was returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation and
definitive closure of her right foot wound. For a detailed
description of this operative procedure , please see the relevant
operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
subsequently returned to the Regular Outpatient Floor where she
remained for the duration of her stay. A general overview of the
patient&apos;s hospital course by system is as follows:
1. Neurological: The patient demonstrated significant issues
with pain control for the duration of her stay. A fair amount of
her pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer;
however , the patient was also noted to have significant pain
associated with her contracted right lower extremity. For a
time , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extension
brace which provided some measure of relief; however , upon
regular examination of her right lower extremity , it was noted
that she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary to
the extension brace. A Neurology and Pain Service consultation
was obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended for
Zanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain control
dramatically. The patient otherwise remained intact from a
neurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,
demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with her
baseline examination.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained stable from a
cardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with no
evidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. At no
point did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemia
or infarction.
3. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
perspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence of
acute respiratory decompensation.
4. GI: The patient remained stable from a gastrointestinal
standpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to be
tolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. Upon discharge ,
she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intake
and was noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts
of stool and flatus.
5. GU: As described previously , the patient was admitted with a
known diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. She was continued
on Macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point this
therapy was discontinued. Subsequent follow-up urinalyses
demonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.
Upon completion of her Macrobid antibiotic course , the patient&apos;s
Foley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independently
productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of her
stay. She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal
compromise or electrolyte imbalance.
6. Heme: The patient remained stable with a stable hematocrit
for the duration of her stay. She was started on Plavix therapy
following her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of her
discharge. DVT prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparin
for the duration of her stay.
7. ID: As stated above , the patient&apos;s operative cultures were
noted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycin
and Keflex. For the majority of her stay , the patient remained
on vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to Keflex on
1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.
At the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed to
complete an additional 10-day course of Keflex therapy. Of note ,
the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for the
duration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidence
of further infection at the ulcer site.
8. Endocrine: The patient maintained adequately well-controlled
blood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence of
acute endocrinological compromise. The patient was subsequently
cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on
postoperative days 10 and 3 , 7/11/2004 , with instructions for
follow up.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Patient is to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility with instructions for follow up.

four weeks prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: Afebrile.
Heart rate 66 , blood pressure 110/48 , breathing 18 , satting 98%
on room air. Patient was noted to be in moderate distress
secondary to discomfort of her right lower extremity with
associated spasm and foot pain. Patient&apos;s lungs were noted to be
clear to auscultation bilaterally. A well-healed right CEA scar
was noted on the patient&apos;s neck. Patient&apos;s heart was noted to
have a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Patient&apos;s abdomen was noted to be soft , nondistended and
nontender. Extremity exam demonstrated a right leg with severe
knee contracture and spasm. The left side was noted to be
normal. The left foot was noted to have two small clean ulcers ,
one on the medial bunion and one on the tip of the medial great
toe. The right foot was noted to have a large dark necrotic
pressure wound on the lateral aspect and plantar aspect of the
mid foot , an open infected-appearing ulcer was noted on the
medial forefoot with surrounding erythema and a greenish exudate
of film. Pulse exam demonstrated 2+ pulses in bilateral
carotids , radials , and femorals. Right popliteal biphasic
Doppler pulses noted. No pulses were able to be distinguished in
the right foot. The left foot was noted to have biphasic signals
in the DP and PT by Doppler.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 101 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 74.
ALT was 36 , AST 33 , alk phos 173 , total bili 0.3 , albumin 4.0.
White blood cell count was 9.6 , hematocrit 36.2 , and platelets
232. PT 13.4 , PTT 28.1 , INR 1.0. Chest x-ray demonstrated a
mild interstitial disease with multiple old right rib fractures.
X-ray of the feet demonstrated bilateral osteopenia with no
evidence of osteomyelitis in either foot. EKG was noted to be
normal with a normal sinus rhythm at 63.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery
Service on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. She
was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime with
wet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. The
patient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid for
previously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to be
discontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  An angiogram
performed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliac
occlusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internal
and external iliac vessels. A distal stenosis of the external
iliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. The
patient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the access
site but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.
Following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , the
patient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremity
DP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration of
her hospital course. On hospital day #3 , the patient was brought
to the operating room for debridement of her right foot. For a
detailed description of the patient&apos;s operative procedure , please
the relevant operative note. Patient tolerated the procedure
well and during the procedure , the patient&apos;s ulcer base was found
to be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , and
therefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. The
patient&apos;s great toe was left in place with moderate debridement
of the deep tissues. The ulcers on the lateral right foot were
not debrided at this time. Following her procedure , the patient
was empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Her
operative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staph
which was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. At this
point , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only and
was continued on VAC therapy through postoperative day #3. At
this point , the patient&apos;s VAC dressing was changed to demonstrate
a well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulation
tissue and no signs of wound necrosis. The patient remained in
stable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , she
was returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation and
definitive closure of her right foot wound. For a detailed
description of this operative procedure , please see the relevant
operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
subsequently returned to the Regular Outpatient Floor where she
remained for the duration of her stay. A general overview of the
patient&apos;s hospital course by system is as follows:
1. Neurological: The patient demonstrated significant issues
with pain control for the duration of her stay. A fair amount of
her pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer;
however , the patient was also noted to have significant pain
associated with her contracted right lower extremity. For a
time , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extension
brace which provided some measure of relief; however , upon
regular examination of her right lower extremity , it was noted
that she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary to
the extension brace. A Neurology and Pain Service consultation
was obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended for
Zanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain control
dramatically. The patient otherwise remained intact from a
neurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,
demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with her
baseline examination.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained stable from a
cardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with no
evidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. At no
point did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemia
or infarction.
3. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
perspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence of
acute respiratory decompensation.
4. GI: The patient remained stable from a gastrointestinal
standpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to be
tolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. Upon discharge ,
she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intake
and was noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts
of stool and flatus.
5. GU: As described previously , the patient was admitted with a
known diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. She was continued
on Macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point this
therapy was discontinued. Subsequent follow-up urinalyses
demonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.
Upon completion of her Macrobid antibiotic course , the patient&apos;s
Foley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independently
productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of her
stay. She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal
compromise or electrolyte imbalance.
6. Heme: The patient remained stable with a stable hematocrit
for the duration of her stay. She was started on Plavix therapy
following her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of her
discharge. DVT prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparin
for the duration of her stay.
7. ID: As stated above , the patient&apos;s operative cultures were
noted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycin
and Keflex. For the majority of her stay , the patient remained
on vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to Keflex on
1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.
At the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed to
complete an additional 10-day course of Keflex therapy. Of note ,
the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for the
duration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidence
of further infection at the ulcer site.
8. Endocrine: The patient maintained adequately well-controlled
blood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence of
acute endocrinological compromise. The patient was subsequently
cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on
postoperative days 10 and 3 , 7/11/2004 , with instructions for
follow up.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Patient is to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility with instructions for follow up.

PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION:
Sodium 146 , creatinine 1.1. INR 2.1. Urinalysis revealed 2+
ketones , 3+ blood , 3+ protein , 15-25 hyaline casts , 25 white
blood cells and 2+ bacteria. Urine cultures and blood cultures
showed no growth. EKG was atrial fibrillation at a rate of with
occasional pacer spikes and old Q-waves in lead III and aVF and
an old right bundle-branch block. Chest x-ray was negative
except for cardiomegaly. CT of the head and neck was negative.
Left hip and pelvic plain films were negative for fractures.
PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:
The patient had an echocardiogram , which showed any EF of 60-65%
and moderate-to-severe left atrial enlargement and right atrial
elongation.
ASSESSMENT:
This is an 83-year-old female with a history of multiple falls
who presented after being found down for approximately 24 hours
in her bathroom in the setting of suspected urinary tract
infection and dehydration.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a urinary
tract infection and was appropriately treated with Levaquin for
three days. After treatment , the patient remained afebrile with
no leukocytosis. Urine and blood cultures were negative , and a
repeat urinalysis was negative.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an echocardiogram done which
revealed an EF of 60-65% and moderate-to-severe left atrial
enlargement and right atrial elongation. The patient&apos;s mitral
valve was unremarkable. The patient&apos;s cardiac enzymes were
cycled , and she was found to have a troponin leak
secondary to demand. Troponin leak did resolve. Serial EKGs
were done , and there were no change when compared with the past
EKG. She was hypertensive on admission and she was continued on
her Lasix and lisinopril , which controlled her blood pressure.
Lasix has been held for the past couple of days due to
dehydration but may be resumed at discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient was taken off of her p.o.
hyperglycemic meds while she was an inpatient and placed on
diabetic protocol of NPH 6 units b.i.d. and 3 units of Aspart
q.a.c. with the sliding scale. Her blood sugars were well
controlled.
4. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient was
dehydrated on admission and given gentle IV fluids. Lasix was
held and should be restarted at discharge. However , at rehab , if
the patient appears to be dehydrated , her Lasix should be
stopped. The patient&apos;s sodium at discharge also went up from
142-146. Free water is encouraged at the bedside. The patient
had a swallow evaluation to assess for any aspiration. Swallow
evaluation recommended mechanical soft diet with thin liquids and
stated that the patient had no signs of aspiration.
5. Hematology: The patient has subtherapeutic INR that is now
being bridged with Lovenox. Her goal INR is 2.5-3.5 given her
St. Jude mitral valve. At discharge , INR is 1.4. The patient
should be continued on Lovenox 60 mg daily , which is renally
dosed as well as Coumadin 5 mg nightly until her INR is
therapeutic and then the Lovenox may be discontinued.
6. Psychiatry: On 8/19/06 , the patient became very agitated
and hostile attempting to exit the bed. The patient was given 1
mg of Haldol and required 4-point restraints. The patient had no
further episodes of this extreme agitation. She does , however ,
have Haldol 0.5 mg b.i.d. as needed for agitation. She was
placed on Zyprexa 2.5 mg nightly , which currently is controlling
her behavior. The patient was followed by Psych during this
admission. At first , the patient was refusing to go to rehab and
she was clearly not safe to go home. Psych did evaluate the
patient to see whether she was capable of making a decision , and
Psych did not feel that she had good judgment or insight into her
problems. Psychiatry felt the patient needed to go to rehab and
after convincing , the patient is now agreeable to go to
rehabilitation.
7. Disposition: The patient is medically stable and now is
going to the Icraig County General Hospital for rehabilitation. The patient is to
fill out her healthcare proxy performed indicating that her son
and minister will be her healthcare proxy. Physical therapy and
occupational therapy has worked with this patient during the
hospitalization and both recommend rehabilitation prior to
returning home. The patient is a fall risk and needs to be
closely watched while she is being anticoagulated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:
The patient&apos;s vital signs are stable. She is awake and alert and
oriented x2-3. She does have some episodes of confusion , and her
speech is somewhat slurred at times. The respiratory exam is
unremarkable.
LABS AT DISCHARGE:
INR was 1.4.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient is to continue Lovenox 60 mg subq daily and Coumadin
5 mg nightly. Lovenox may be discontinued when INR is 2.5-3.5.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Sherill on 10/7 at 2:15 p.m.
The patient&apos;s blood sugars should be monitored at rehabilitation
before meals and corrected with a NovoLog sliding scale , and the
patient should be encouraged to drink free water at the bedside
and her electrolytes should be monitored. The patient&apos;s Lasix
may be held if she appeared dehydrated.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Amiodarone 100 mg p.o. daily , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily , Lovenox
60 mg subq daily , Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily , Micronase 2.5 mg p.o.

Assessment: 46F s/p gastric bypass and recent NSAID use p/w melena ,
LH , rel hypotension , found to have HCT 24 ( baseline 36 )
Hospital Course: The patient was admitted for GI bleeding and anemia.
She was transfused to units of pRBC&apos;s in ED for HCT=24--&gt;28--&gt;31--&gt;28.
The patient was initially started on a nexium iv drip and then was
restarted on oral PPI once EGD was performed and no source of bleeding
could be identified ( as above ). The patient also underwent colonoscopy
which was normal. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospital course and her symptoms of lightheadedness , palpitations and
shortness of breath fully resolved. No further episodes of melena
occured during her hospitalization. The patient was instructed to avoid
NSAIDs and to continue Protonix 40mg BID. The patient was instructed to
have her HCT rechecked at her PCP&apos;s office the following week and to call
the GI office for followup. Her iron studies ( fe 20 , TIBC 361 , Ferr 9 )
were consistent w/ iron deficiency and the pt was given an informational
sheet on good nutritional sources of iron for repletion.
CODE STATUS: FULL CONTACT:
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted for GI Bleeding and had an upper endoscopy and
colonoscopy to evaluate the source. Your upper endoscopy demonstrated
mild erosions in the esophagus , but did not identify a definite source of
bleeding. Your colonoscopy was normal.
- As the use of NSAIDs ( including Naproxen , Ibuprofen , feldene ) increases
the risk of GI Bleeding , you should no longer use these medications.
Tylenol is a safe alternative for pain control for you.
- You should have your hematocrit rechecked at your primary care
physician&apos;s office on Tuesday , November to ensure that your blood levels are
stable.
- Your iron stores are low because of your recent bleeding. I have given
you a handout listing good nutritional sources of iron.
- Please seek medical attention if the bleeding recurs or you develop
abdominal pain , lightheadedness , heart racing , shortness of breath or
fever.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
- Please recheck patient&apos;s hematocrit on November to confirm stability.
- Please recheck pt&apos;s iron studies to determine whether they recover
appropriately with nutritional iron supplementation.

OPERATION: Reoperation coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.
Errol Mikhail on 11 of October .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54-year-old black
woman who is status post coronary
artery bypass grafting approximately two years ago by Dr. Micciche
who had developed recurrent substernal chest pain approximately
four months after her bypass surgery. The patient underwent
exercise treadmill testing which showed non-diagnostic ST segment
changes. However , thallium studies revealed decreased perfusion to
the apex , superior portion of the septum as well as the
anterolateral wall. There was reperfusion of the high septal and
anterolateral wall. The patient then proceeded to cardiac
catheterization which revealed 100% stenosis of her previous graft.
Additionally there was 100% mid stenosis of the right coronary
artery , 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending , 90% mid
stenosis of the first diagonal , and 100% stenosis of the circumflex
after the first obtuse marginal. There was anterior hypokinesis as
well as apical and inferior akinesis. There was severely decreased
left ventricular function. The pulmonary pressures were fairly
unremarkable. Thus , the patient presented for reop coronary artery
bypass grafting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room on
11 of October .  Under general endotracheal anesthesia
coronary artery bypass grafting times three was performed. The
right internal mammary artery was grafted to the first diagonal as
well as saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending , the
old obtuse marginal graft , and the second diagonal. The patient
was found to have dense cardiac adhesions. Her old right coronary
artery graft was occluded and the old obtuse marginal graft was
tightly stenotic at the origin. The left internal mammary artery
was subtotally occluded distally. The patient spontaneously
defibrillated and demonstrated modestly decreased left ventricular
function. The patient was taken to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
in stable rhythm with stable vital signs. Postoperatively the
patient&apos;s course was thoroughly unremarkable. The patient required
sodium Nitroprusside in the immediate postoperative period. There
was no evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. The
patient was successfully extubated on the second postoperative day
and her mediastinal and pleural tubes were also pulled without
significant incident. The patient&apos;s diuresis was initiated and
tolerated well. The rest of the patient&apos;s postoperative course was
unremarkable. She remained in normal sinus rhythm without any
evidence of arrhythmia. She was essentially afebrile and her
wounds were all healing well. However , on chest x-ray it was
demonstrated that the patient had right lower lobe collapse.
Because of her afebrile state and good oxygenation on room air the
patient was not bronch&apos;d in order to re-expand her right lower
lobe. At the time of dictation , one day prior to proposed
discharge the patient&apos;s chest x-ray showed some improved aeration
of that lower lobe. Thus , the patient will likely be discharged on
18 of May .
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg po q d , baby
aspirin one po q d , Diabinese 500 mg po q d , iron
sulfate 325 mg po tid , Colace , Percocet. The patient will be
discharged to home. FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr.
Rory Broadnax in four to five weeks and with private medical
doctor and cardiologist in one to two weeks. The patient will also
have visiting nurse come in to check on her in the immediate
postoperative period.

e her prior EGD was negative and she already had the anemia at that
time. If this is negative she should see Dr. Standafer at Ibrook N Hospital for a
capsular camera small bowel study.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: please weigh yourself each day and if your weight changes more than two
to three pounds over the course of two days call Dr. Cubie office
and she can adjust your diuretics to remove the excess fluid. Also
please drink diabetic beverages and limit yourself to 8-10 glasses of
fluid per day. You will see the gastroenterologists as an outpatient
for an EGD to evaluate your blood loss.

Discharge Date: 11/3/1991
DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 62 year old female
with a history of unstable angina , who
presented for coronary artery bypass grafting. She ruled out for a
myocardial infarction on 11 of August .  She had a negative exercise
tolerance test on 29 of March .  She then had persistent epigastric
pain with some ST changes on electrocardiogram on 12 of March .  She
underwent cardiac catheterization demonstrating multivessel
disease. The patient had an echocardiogram showing mildly
decreased left ventricular function. She then had a positive
exercise tolerance test on 19 of September , and this was positive. She
was referred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for treatment of her
disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
30 of June , where she underwent a 2-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft. The patient tolerated the procedure quite
nicely and postoperatively was taken to the Cardiac Intensive Care
Unit for close follow-up. There she progressed quite nicely and
had no major difficulties. She was extubated on postoperative day
#2 without difficulty. She was diuresed appropriately and was
transferred to the postoperative cardiac floor. There , she
progressed in routine fashion. She had a small amount of drainage
from the left lower extremity incision at the vein harvest site ,
but otherwise had no difficulties. At that time of discharge , the
patient had a benign examination with stable , clean , dry and intact
sternum. She had clear lungs and a regular rate on cardiac
examination. Left lower extremity vein harvest site had no
evidence of infection. She did have a temperature to 100.1 on the
night prior to discharge. However , she had a negative white count
and urinalysis was negative. She had a negative chest x-ray ,
except for some mild atelectasis on the day prior to discharge.
She was to follow her temperature at home and report any
temperature greater 100.5.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. She was to have
Visiting Nurse Association services. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE were Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Ecotrin 325 milligrams by mouth each day , Zantac 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , Percocet 1 to 2 by mouth every 4 hours as
needed , Serax 15 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep as needed.

HPI: 75M w/ hx of DM , HTN , Hchol , recent CVA ( 4/06 ) , Afib ,
CRI , CAD/MI s/p RCA stenting ( 2002 ) and poor cardiac f/up ( Dr.
Sarcinella ) p/w CP. States feeling ok when awoke this AM. Then had
fleeting substernal cp ( 30sec ) w/out SOB , N/V/Radiation , not like
prior CP. Shortly after had another fleeting episode.
Concerned came to ED where was pain free. Given ASA X 1. Enzymes neg
X1 , EKG w/ bs line abnormality but unchanged. Per outpt cardiologist ,
preffered admission to WESWA MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER team for R/O.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. )
CARDS: Admitted for R/O. While presentation not suspicious
for current cardiac event , given history of cardiac dz , mulitple risk
factors and atypical presentations assoc w/ dm , reasonable to R/O. Note ,
Pt did have recent negative stress test at CJCGH , though limited study.
In house , continued on ASA , BB , STATIN , ACE. His lipids were mildly
elevated with LDL 80s , though already on Lipitor 80 and cholestyramine.
HGA1c was pending at time of discharge but should be followed as
outpatient to ensure good DM control. Of note , Pt had HR to the 40&apos;s
inhouse , though asymptomatic. He was maintained on lopressor while
observed and transitioned to his home dose of Atenolol 50qd which has
been a stable , asymptomatic dose. Given extremely low risk presentation
and r/o , pt was discharged following morning for outpatient follow up. If
a repeat imaging is performed , may reccomend for chemical stress study as
prior stress limited. Should note that EKG had evidence of significant
LVH and repol abnormality corroberated with recent echo. Would continue
to assess for possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy along with familial
risk assessment as outpatient.
Patient also w/ hx of Parox Afib , now in sinus and recent stroke. His
rate was well cotnrolled in house on BB. On admission , INR was 3.2 and
warfarin dose reduced to 2mg ( from 4mg ). On following day , INR 3.4. Pt
instructed to hold dose that evening and will follow in coumadin clinic
on 2/22/06 .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. ) Continue medications as directed.
2. ) If fleeting episodes of pain recur , would not worry ( though notify
PCP/caridologist if severe , perisistant , or associated w/ shortness of
breath , prior heart attack symptoms. Can use motrin for occasional pains.
3. ) Follow up w/ Dr. Sterling Wegweiser in V cardiology clinic as scheduled.
4. ) Follow up w/ Dr. Royal with in one week re: follow up on oral
infection.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:

Discharge Date: 1/4/2005
ATTENDING: CASTONGVAY , JERALD M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Change in mental status.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS:
Urinary tract infection , hypertension , diabetes , and coronary
artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is an 83-year-old female with history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , pulmonary carcinoid , and
coronary artery disease who presented with weakness and a change
in mental status. Her son found her at home on the floor. The
patient stated that she fell secondary to weakness. Her weakness
and change in mental status had lasted approximately one week.
She also complained of dysuria. No chest pain , no shortness of
breath , no nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. At baseline , the
patient is alert and oriented x3. She lives alone and functions
independently. In the emergency room , a CAT scan of the head was
negative for acute process. Troponin was 0.2 , and therefore she
was started on IV heparin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 190/82 ,
respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen 99% on room air. General: The
patient was in no acute distress , alert , and oriented only x1 to
person. HEENT: NC/AT. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: Normal
S1 , S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Lungs were clear bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended , positive for bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema
or cyanosis: Neuro exam: Strength was equal bilaterally , but
weak 3/5 throughout. Sensation was intact throughout. Cranial
nerves III through XII were grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs on admission showed a white blood cell count of 12.3 ,
hematocrit was 36.4 , CK of 3499 , and troponin of 0.2. Her EKG
was normal sinus rhythm , new 1 mm ST depression in leads II , III ,
and aVF. Her chest x-ray showed right lower lobe mass , which was
unchanged from her previous x-ray. Her head CT was negative.
Urinalysis on admission showed too numerous to count white blood
cells , plus nitrates , and plus leukocyte esterase.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an 83-year-old with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and
medically managed b.i.d. who is admitted with change mental
status and fall secondary to weakness.
1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a UTI ,
which is likely the reason for confusion and weakness. She was
started on ciprofloxacin. Urine cultures were sent and grew
Klebsiella and Citrobacter , which were indeed sensitive to
ciprofloxacin and she was continued on the ciprofloxacin.
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. She had a troponin leak on
admission of 0.2. A B set of cardiac enzymes was negative for , the
troponin level was less than assay. The leak was most likely secondary to
demand ischemia in the setting of an infection. A C set of her cardiac enzymes
was negative as well. The heparin was therefore discontinued. The
patient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but is
not a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor&apos;s
notes. In-house , she was continued on aspirin , statin and a
beta-blocker , which was changed during her admission from
Lopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her blood
pressure remained high and blood pressure optimization was
attempted. Norvasc was also increased to 10 mg daily and
hydralazine was given p.r.n. for blood pressure greater than 140 ,
for which she received a few doses. She was also continued on
lisinopril and Diovan and she was monitored on telemetry. The
only event on telemetry being a short run of SVT.
3. Neurologic: The patient&apos;s change in mental status was likely
related to urinary tract infection. The head CT on admission was
negative. Her neuro exam was not suggestive of any focal
deficits. Her Detrol was held during the admission due to its
effect on mental status. Her weakness was likely due to
deconditioning. She was very weak and had trouble sitting at the
edge of the bed or transferring to a chair with physical therapy.
She was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehabilitation
and 24-hour supervision. The family refused transfer to a
Skilled Nursing Facility despite the recommendation and they
understood the concern and risks. They reportedly planned to
supervise the patient on their own , 24 hours everyday.
4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , her blood
sugars were low on admission. Originally , her NPH dose was cut
in half. Her blood sugars were monitored and remained quite low.
Therefore , her evening NPH was halved again to 5 units at
bedtime. Her appetite remained fair during the admission , but not
great.
5. Prophylaxis: She received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
CODE STATUS:
DNR/DNI was instituted after lengthy discussions with the
patient&apos;s family.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. See the primary care doctor within two weeks.
2. Discuss with your PCP when and if you should resume Detrol.
3. Return to the emergency room if you experience fevers ,
worsening confusion , chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , or other concerns.

No restrictions.
ACTIVITY:
Bed to chair transfers with assistance and supervision and other
instructions per home physical therapy.

ATTENDING: ESTEBAN TRACHTE MD
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:
Byron Finnin , M.D.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Intraabdominal abscess.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with history of hypertension
and perforated sigmoid diverticulitis status post a partial
colectomy at the splenic flexure and Hartmann pouch on 2/28/05 ,
who presented at an outside hospital with chills and fevers of
temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit , as well as shortness of
breath and hypotension. The patient was transferred to the
Shire Hospital for further care. She denied
nausea , vomiting , and had only mild abdominal pain and abdominal
distension noted per the patient. However , her fevers and chills
continued.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , chronic back pain , and nephrolithiasis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Right total knee replacement , appendectomy , cholecystectomy , and
partial colectomy at the splenic flexure as noted above.
MEDICATIONS:
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 15 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40
mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , albuterol nebulizer
p.r.n. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 15 mg to 30 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , oxycodone as needed , and heparin subcutaneous t.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient presented after a brief stay for one week at Councoovir Catbelle Medical Center Of .  She is the aunt of a Pageway Hospital cardiologist , Dr. Cavalli .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature is 98.8 , heart rate 94 , blood pressure 80/54 ,
respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen saturation 95% on 2 liters nasal
cannula. In general , the patient was in no acute distress. Her
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence
of wheezes. The heart was regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2
normal with 3/6 systolic murmur. Abdomen was soft and obese.
Mild tenderness of the inferior aspect of her ostomy stoma. No
rebound tenderness was noted. The stoma color was normal. There
was gas and stool in the stoma bag. Her midline abdominal
incision was open with pink granulation tissue. Extremities were
notable for only trace pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA:
Chemistry: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 100 , bicarbonate
34 , BUN 25 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 187. Liver enzymes: AST
8 , ALT 13 , alkaline phosphatase 89 , and T-bili 0.2 , and lactic
acid 1.2. CBC: White blood cell count 13.5 , hematocrit 31.3 ,
and platelets 513 , 000. Cardiac enzymes were normal with the CK
of 33 and MB fraction of 1.2. Troponin was less than assay. EKG
showed left anterior fascicular block and sinus rhythm.
IMAGING:
CT of the abdomen showed a 6 cm x 2 cm left-sided intraabdominal
fluid collection and a 4.2 cm fluid collection around the stoma ,
which both were seemed to as consistent with abscess formation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Windreal Claall Onli Medical Center Surgical Service on
1/12/05 for management of her intraabdominal abscesses as a
complication of recently performed partial colectomy and Hartmann
pouch for perforated diverticulitis. She was started on IV
antibiotics with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. By
systems.
Neuro: The patient had intermittent issues with pain control ,
which were managed by putting the patient on oral narcotic agents
as well as fentanyl patch. This seemed to help the patient&apos;s
pain. The patient also had an episode of altered mental status ,
which was believed to be due to pulmonary issues of CO2 retention
as noted below. For this reason , the patient had been
transferred to the ICU for 24-hour period observation , and at the
time of discharge , the patient was in adequate mental status
communicating effectively and at her baseline. Otherwise , no
issues at the time of discharge , except for pain control , being
managed by narcotic agents.
Cardiovascular: The patient was stable throughout her
hospitalization. However , it was notable at the time of her
previous admission that the patient would need to undergo an
echocardiogram within one to two weeks. For this reason , the
patient underwent an echocardiogram during her hospitalization
and was found to have normal ejection fraction of 65%. There
were no regional wall motion abnormalities noted. Her aortic
valve showed trace aortic insufficiency and the patient also had
mild degree of aortic stenosis with the valve of 1.4 cm squared.
Her mitral valve was shown to have some degree of mitral
regurgitation and the patient also had some tricuspid
regurgitation as well. Her right ventricle was seemed to be okay
and she did have some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
No evidence of gross cardiac dysfunction.
Pulmonary: The patient on hospital day #6 was found to have
altered mental status in the evening. An ABG was checked , which
showed a pH of 7.42 , pCO2 of 61 , and pO2 of 58 , 92% oxygen
saturation on 3 to 4 liters with the base access of 12. For this
reason , it was determined that the patient would need to be
admitted to the surgical ICU for further monitoring of her
pulmonary status. She was taken to the ICU and admitted there.
During her ICU course , the patient was placed on BiPAP , which
effectively brought her bicarbonate and her pCO2 levels down.
This did effectively decrease her pCO2. Hence by hospital day
#8 , the patient was transferred back to the floor in stable
condition. From her pulmonary standpoint , the patient continued
to have some degree of bibasilar crackles during her
hospitalization. However , given her otherwise stable status , the
patient was encouraged to perform and sent to spirometry and
Lasix was withheld during the later course of her hospital
course. At the time of discharge , the patient was with adequate
oxygen saturation sating 97% on 1 liter at the time of discharge.
GI: The patient had no trouble eating regular diet during her
hospital course. Her ostomy continued to function well with the
stoma pink and healthy. She did have two intraabdominal
abscesses , which were drained on hospital day #2 by
Interventional Radiology. Two IR catheters were placed and these
were left in place until the output was deemed to be minimal , and
a CT scan was performed as well as an abscessogram , both of which
reveled that the fluid collections had resolved. Hence on
hospital day #10 , the patient&apos;s interventional radiology drains
were discontinued without complications. At the time of
discharge , the patient was stable with a soft abdomen and no
evidence of infection. The patient did have a midline abdominal
incision open with pink granulation tissue , healing well. The
pain was treated with wet-to-dry normal saline dressing , b.i.d.
to t.i.d.
GU: The patient continued to have good urine output during her
hospital course. She did require Foley placement from adequate
monitoring of her urine output at 1.8. Urinalysis , as well as
urine culture was sent , which revealed yeast greater than 100 , 000
yeast , not Candida albicans. She was started on a five-day
course of fluconazole and her Foley catheter was discontinued for
treatment of this infection. At the time of discharge , the
patient was urinating adequate amounts independently without any
issues.
Heme: The patient&apos;s hematocrit remained stable during her
hospital course. However , during her stay in the ICU , hematocrit
was found to be 27 and the patient received 1 unit of packed red
blood cells without any complications or events. At the time of
discharge , the patient&apos;s hematocrit was found to be 43 without
any event. She continued to receive subcutaneous heparin t.i.d.
for DVT prophylaxis.
ID: The patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl during her hospital course for the intraabdominal
abscesses. Fluconazole was also added for the treatment of a
urinary tract infection with the yeast. The antibiotics were
continued until the drains were removed on hospital day #10. On
hospital day #10 , the patient was transitioned to levofloxacin ,
which is to be continued for a 10-day total course benign
1/27/05 , 10 further days of levofloxacin required for adequate
covered. However , it should be noted that the IR drains were
found to be negative and only revealed purulent fluid. Gram
stain was indicative of sterile purulent fluid. Cultures were
negative.
Tubes , lines , and drains: As noted above , the patient had the
placement of two interventional radiology drains , which were
discontinued prior to discharge. At the time of discharge , the
patient has no Foley and no IR drains in place.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain , albuterol nebulizes 2.5 mg
nebulizer q.4h. p.r.n. wheezing , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Pepcid

levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x13 more doses starting 5/15/05 .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is discharged to Pa Medical Center for further management. The patient was given adequate
instructions for her further care and the same was passed on to
NACCH .  The patient is to receive dressing changes ,
physical therapy assistance , and ostomy care. The patient should
follow up with Dr. Colestock in one to two weeks for further
surgical management follow up and should also be seen by Dr.
Walter Soltero for her cardiovascular follow up.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 59-year-old morbidly obesity woman with a history of
diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with a recent
AV graft infection , sepsis , thoracic cord compression status post
fusion secondary to MRSA osteomyelitis , recurrent C. difficile infections ,
life-threatening epistaxis , who was status post embolization , who
is now admitted to the Renal Service with suspected fungemia
thought to be associated with her tunneled catheter. The
patient , however , is asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
1.. Infectious Disease: The patient had a positive blood
culture identified on surveillance blood cultures. The patient
was initially started on micafungin IV while speciation and
sensitivities were pending. The patient received five days of
micafungin IV 100 mg IV daily. Cultures then came back with
Candida glabrata that was sensitive to fluconazole. At that
time , she was converted over to oral fluconazole 400 mg once
daily. Surveillance blood cultures with fungal isolators were
sent on a daily basis while in the hospital , all of which have come back
negative to date. The patient also had her tunneled catheter line pulled on
10/1/07 .  She was evaluated by Ophthalmology to rule out
endophthalmitis and was determined not to have evidence of this.
She also received a transthoracic echocardiogram to rule out
vegetation. The patient has a history of MRSA osteomyelitis with
a cord compression status post decompression with hardware and
was continued on levofloxacin and IV vancomycin which was
scheduled to continue until 4/18/07 .  Blood cultures from
1/25/07 grew out VRE bacteremia , and the patient was at that
time converted from IV vancomycin to linezolid 600 mg orally
twice daily on 9/27/07 .  She also received one dose of
gentamicin 80 mg IV x1. A new tunneled catheter had been placed
on 3/7/07 and given that the blood cultures was VRE grew back
positive on 1/25/07 , it was certain that the new tunneled
catheter was not the source of VRE and the decision was made to treat
through the line. All subsequent blood cultures from 9/27/07
and 2/28/07 are all negative to date. The patient had one
temperature spike to 101 degrees , and she was recultured of these
cultures which were negative. She also had a repeat chest x-ray
which showed only minimal atelectasis and no evidence of
pneumonia. The patient subsequently defervesced. And has been afebrile for
over 72 hours. Also , of note ,
the patient had a history of C. difficile. She was continued on oral
vancomycin for suppression. She did continue to have numerous
loose stools during the hospitalization and C. difficile cultures
were sent twice on 6/8/07 and again on 3/7/07 , both of which
were negative. Also , of note , the patient has sacral decubitus
ulcer that was watched closely for infection.
2. Renal: As noted above , the patient&apos;s tunneled catheter was
removed as it was deemed the most likely source of her fungemia.
She was dialyzed once through her temporary femoral line and
tunneled catheter was then placed on 3/7/07 and the patient was
dialyzed approximately every two days with the last dialysis on
10/11/07 .  The patient is due for hemodialysis on 7/14/07 .
3. Heme: The patient has a history of anemia that is consistent
with chronic disease. She received 1 unit of packed red cells
during her hospitalization.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient , on admission , had right upper
quadrant tenderness with an elevated alkaline phosphatase and
GGT. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and to rule
out biliary obstruction. This study showed a normal liver. A
gallbladder with a few small stones as well as sludge ,
gallbladder wall thickness was normal. There was no sonographic
Murphy&apos;s sign , and biliary tree was noted to have a dilated
common bile duct of 7 mm that was unchanged and distal ducts were
not well seen. The intrahepatic ducts were noted to be normal.
The patient&apos;s Zocor , however , was held in the setting of elevated
LFTs. Abdominal pain resolved on hospital day 2 and LFTs trended to normal.
Also , of note , the patient had a history of C. difficile
as noted above. She continued to have diarrhea although her C.
difficile cultures were negative. She was treated
symptomatically with Lomotil. A rectal tube was also placed
given her diarrhea and increased pain with soiling of ulcer as well as risk of
infection. Rectal tube should be continued in rehab to prevent
infection of the sacral ulcers.
5. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation with RVR and was continued on her Lopressor ,
amiodarone. She did not have any episodes of rapid ventricular
rate , nor any episodes of hemodynamic instability or
hypertension.
6. Neuro: The patient has bilateral lower extremity weakness
and loss of sensation of the right lower extremity likely
sequelae of recent cord compression , per Neuro notes in the
medical record from 11/22/06 .  The patient also had an episode of
acute delirium. As a result , her Reglan was discontinued as was
her fentanyl patch and her mental status improved although she
still had baseline memory deficits. Psychiatry was consulted and
recommended tapering her Celexa and Cymbalta in the setting of
waxing and waning mental status. The patient has also been
counseled to avoid oxycodone or any other narcotics for pain
control and to try to only use Tylenol.
7. Derm: The patient has a sacral as well as right heel
decubitus ulcer. The wound nurse was consulted , and the patient
received Panafil ointment to the sacral ulcers twice daily.
Sacral wound is to be irrigated with warm saline and then Panafil
is to be applied to open areas twice daily , and then wound is to
be dressed with dry sterile dressing , all twice a day. The
patient has sutures in place from thoracic spinal fusion.
Orthopedics was consulted to remove some of the sutures.
Approximately , 50% of the sutures , however , were not ready to
come out , and the patient should follow up with Dr. Hans V Cumoletti on 1/12/07 for removal of the remaining sutures. This
area should be evaluated at least daily and dressings changed
once daily with dry sterile dressings.
8. Vascular: The patient was noted to have oozing at the site
of her old AV graft and the right antecubital fossa on 7/25 .  Vascular
Surgery was consulted and evacuated a hematoma on 7/25 .  This wound is to be
dressed with 2 x 2s , soaked to normal saline and is to be changed
three times daily. The patient is to follow up with Dr. Daron T Pogar from Vascular Surgery in two weeks to evaluate this wound
site.
9. Psychiatry: The patient had a flat affect and was thought to
be appropriately depressed in past hospitalizations. She was
initially continued on Cymbalta and Celexa. Psychiatry was
consulted and felt that the patient was demonstrating some
delirium , but she was currently not depressed and recommended that
her Cymbalta and Celexa be tapered. She is currently in the
process of being tapered , and this taper should continue as noted
in the discharge medication section.
10. Pain: The patient was initially treated with fentanyl and
oxycodone per rehabilitation regimen. Her fentanyl patch was
quickly discontinued in the setting of one episode of acute
delirium. Her oxycodone was continued and she required
approximately 10 mg of oxycodone daily. She , however , has been
counseled to try to wean herself off of oxycodone , and use only
Tylenol for pain given propensity to delirium.
11. HEENT: The patient had a history of severe epistaxis. She ,
however , has not had any epistaxis during this admission. She
was continued on saline nasal sprays.
12. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: The patient was seen
by Nutrition consultants. Her zinc and vitamin C were
discontinued to avoid copper deficiency. She was started on
Megace 400 mg twice daily , and she was placed on a liberal diet
to encourage p.o. intake. The patient required some electrolyte
repletion including repletion of phosphate and potassium. Of
note , phosphate should not be repleted with Neutrophos but with
sodium phosphate for phosphates less than 1.5 possibly
given the potassium load and Neutrophos. At time of discharge however patient
did not have IV acess. Patient should recieve one dose of neutraphos 1 packet
x1 upon arrival to rehab. She should then have a basic metabolic panel checked
on 2/12/07 to ensure her potassium is normal.
13. Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on subcutaneous
heparin as well as a PPI.

presented to Pointden University Of Health Center on 4/29/02 complaining of signigicant
rectal bright red blood per rectum , weakness , lightheadedness , and
diaphoresis. HPI: Pt had been in usual state of health until 7/10 when
he noted 2 episodes of blood in his stool that were associated with
lower abdominal cramping. On 9/10 he began to bleed from his rectum
while at rest and also began to feel weak , light headed and
diaphoretic.
He experienced nausea and LLQ cramping , but denied fever , chills ,
vomiting , chest pain , palpitations , shortness of breath or loss of
consciousness. He also denied dysphagia , odynophagia , or hematemesis.
At BH he was noted to have a BP of 79/48 , P 83 , anda hematocrit of
28.2. He received 2U PRBC and with improvement in BP. A tagged RBC
scan at the time was negative. On 10/21 he again developed BRBPR. Hct
at the time was 20 , and a second RBC scan was negative. He received 6
more units of PRBC and was transferred to the MH MICU on 10/21 .

The pt remained asympotomatic , though he continued to bleed and
required repeated transfusions ( 7U PRBC ). He was also noticed to have
increased PT ( 1.4 ) and decreased PLTs to 108 and received 2units FFP
and 1 unit PLTs. He had no rectal bleeding after 8/10 .  Colonoscopy
on 8/10 showed diffuse diverticulosis , but no active bleeding. The
scope was unable to move beyond the hepatic flexure
.
His lisinopril and torsemide were intially held following his
hypotensive episodes , but were restarted on 10/28 with good effect. An

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with history of severe and
operable coronary artery disease , status post CABG , history of
ventricular tachycardia , status post ICD placement who is on
amiodarone , end stage renal disease on hemodialysis , status post
CVA , who presents with chest pain and a report of a syncopal
episode. He is followed at SRHO and has multiple multiple
admissions for chest pain and rule out MI in the setting of
receiving or having just received hemodialysis. On the day prior
to admission , 9/17/04 , the patient had chest pain and
hemodialysis and was admitted to PACMH where he was ruled out for
MI by enzymes. He was discharged from BAHM on 8/5/04 and later
that day , per the patient , he had a fight with his family members
and stood up and abruptly felt lightheaded and &quot;passed out.&quot; He
reports no palpitations or chest pain prior to the event and
believes that he may have been unconscious for 20 minutes.
Talking to the family , the patient was actually attempting to
throw something at this son , fell , and had no loss of
consciousness after falling. The patient reports that he woke on
the floor and developed severe chest pain with radiation to the
left arm and jaw , which is typical with his anginal symptoms
according to his cardiologist. He denies any recent change in
chronic shortness of breath or exercise capacity , orthopnea , or
increased edema. He had a recent MIBI on 4/7 that showed
mild mid anterior and inferior wall ischemia with a
posterior-basal scar. He was deemed an obvious surgical
candidate and has been medically managed.
In the emergency department , he received IV fluids , aspirin ,
sublingual nitroglycerin x 3 and morphine with resolution of
chest pain. Upon admission to the medical team , his vital signs
were stable and he denied chest pain. He was admitted to rule
out myocardial infarction.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES:
1. Cardiovascular ischemia: This patient with a known history
of CAD who has been medically managed per his primary
cardiologist. He has a history of CABG. His last cath was in
8/22 that showed diffuse disease. At which time , he received
stents to the left main and LAD. On this admission , the patient
ruled out for MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes
including troponin. No EKG changes were noted. He was continued
on aspirin products and beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor ,
and amiodarone. The patient is not on a statin though he has
been in the past; he reports that he had some sort of a reaction
to the medication. On the day after his admission , he had chest
pain and hemodialysis but was relieved by sublingual
nitroglycerin. Over his hospital course , he continued to have
2-3 episodes of chest pain per day that were relieved by
nitroglycerine and morphine. He had no EKG changes in the
setting of any of these episodes. Isordil was added for improved
pain control briefly. Cardiology was consulted and felt that the
frequency of the pain , the rapid onset and offset , and the
reproducibility of the pain to palpation made angina less likely;
they did not feel that catheterization or further workup was
indicated.
2. Cardiovascular pump function: Initially , the patient was dry
on exam , and demonstrated no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
He was actually orthostatic by symptoms but his blood pressure
remained stable. His story of losing consciousness was difficult
to corroborate; if he did indeed lose consciousness , his history
is consistent with orthostasis. Management was monitored by the
Hemodialysis Service.
3. Cardiovascular rhythm: The patient has an ICD for history of
VT , and he is continued on amiodarone. There was concern that
possible arrhythmia or pacer malfunction could have been the
cause of his symptoms. In addition , when he fell he said he
might have fallen on his pacemaker site. On the morning after
his admission , when he was on hemodialysis , the patient and nurse
both heard a belching sound that seemed to be coming from the
area of the patient&apos;s pacemaker. The electrophysiology team was
consulted and pacemaker was interrogated and found to be
functioning well , with no history of arrhythmia or alarm. EKGs
remained unchanged from baseline , except there was a prolongation
of QTC with the initiation of Zyprexa , which was stopped. The
patient&apos;s heart rate remained stable in the 50s-60s on his
cardiac regimen.
4. Renal: The patient has end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis and was apparently incompletely dialyzed on the day
prior to admission. Due to chest pain , it was initially
difficult to have the patient complete a course of hemodialysis
but over his hospital stay he was dialyzed effectively. He has
arrangements to follow up with his outpatient hemodialysis after
discharge
5. Psychiatry: After ruling out for myocardial infarction ,
plans were being made to discharge the patient home and the
patient&apos;s family was called. They reported concern that did not
want the patient to return home because of abusive and erratic
behavior by the patient. They reported that actually in the
setting of the patient&apos;s fall , the police were called and when
they arrived the patient complained of chest pain and was brought
to the hospital by ambulance. There was a history of restraining
or taking out by the wife against the patient , and she reported
feeling unsafe with him from the home. Psychiatry did see the
patient and felt that he was unreliable and was probably not safe
to go home to take care of himself , but that he was also
confident to make decisions and was not acutely psychotic , and
therefore , it should not be committed against his will. The
patient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient
was started on SSRI and initially on Zyprexa though this was
stopped because of prolonged QTC. After a few days , the patient&apos;
family changed their mind and decided that they would be okay
with him coming home. The situation was discussed with the
patient&apos;s primary doctor , with the family over the phone , as they
would not come in for a family meeting with the patient and he
did go home , but will likely require a psych follow up as an
outpatient.
6. Endocrine: The patient continued on insulin and Regular
Insulin sliding scale for his history of diabetes.
7. Infectious disease: The patient developed a low blood
pressure and was noted to have erythema and pus from the site of
his hemodialysis catheter in the right subclavian position. He
became fully hypertensive and required a brief course of pressors
to maintain blood pressure. The catheter was removed and
cultures were obtained that demonstrated methicillin-resistant
Staph aureus. The patient was treated with vancomycin and
gentamicin dose to his renal function and showed improvement in
his symptoms in clearance of his bacteremia. The gentamicin was
stopped and plans were made for the patient to receive vancomycin
as an outpatient and hemodialysis in follow up. He was dialyzed
from VAF fistula in his arm that had been created a number of
months prior to this admission.
8. Nutrition: The patient was seen by nutrition and was given a
renal carbohydrate controlled low fat low cholesterol diet. He
was continued on Nephrocaps. B12 and folate were normal.

Discharge Date: 1/9/1994
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The chief complaint is abdominal
distention , nausea , and vomiting.
Patient is a 49 year old black female with the onset of mild
epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting developing several hours
before presentation to the Emergency Room. She has a history of
hypertension , borderline diabetes mellitus , hiatal hernia , and
umbilical hernia. Patient went to sleep on the night of
presentation with mild pain and awoke in the middle of the night
with more severe pain. The pain was intermittent and came in waves
approximately every three to five minutes , somewhat positional , and
worse with lying or standing. She denied shortness of breath and
she said her last bowel movement was earlier on the evening of
presentation which the patient reported as normal in consistency.
She denied bright red blood per rectum and she denied any urinary
tract symptoms. She also denied any gynecological/vaginal
symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for: 1 ) Umbilical
hernia/ventral hernia. 2 ) Hiatal hernia. 3 ) Bilateral tubal
ligation. 4 ) Left lower extremity venous insufficiency. 5 )
Hypertension. 6 ) Borderline diabetes mellitus. CURRENT
MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile , heart rate was 76 , blood
pressure of 160/100 , and room air saturation
of 89%. GENERAL: She was an obese black female in moderate
distress. HEENT: Anicteric and 2+ carotid pulses with no bruits.
CHEST: Had distant lung sounds. CARDIAC: Examination was regular
with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Examination was
large and obese with a ventral supraumbilical hernia with an
indistinct fascial edge , partially reduced but possibly with a
second aspect just above the umbilical hernia , a 5-6 cm mass which
was non-reducible , faint bowel sounds with diffuse tenderness.
RECTAL: She was noted to be guaiac negative on rectal examination
and non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Examination was warm and atraumatic.
Of note , she had 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses and her
posterior tibial pulses were not palpable. Her left calf was
tender which the patient reported to be chronic and her entire calf
was firm with no cords palpable. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm , left
atrial enlargement , question of poor R
wave progression , no ST or T wave changes , and her chest X-Ray was
clear with no active disease. Her KUB showed the nasogastric tube
in place with few air filled loops of small bowel and there was air
and stool in the large bowel. Her laboratories on admission were
notable for an SMA 7 showing a sodium of 141 , potassium of 3.9 ,
chloride 95 , carbon dioxide 32 , BUN 9 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose of
222 , amylase of 33 , her lipase was 10 , white blood cell count was
7.8 , her hematocrit was 53.4 , and platelets were 198.
HOSPITAL COURSE: A nasogastric tube was placed and drained 500 cc
of aspirate after 500 cc of emesis. She was
admitted with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction with three
supraumbilical reducible hernias and one periumbilical incarcerated
hernia. The plan was to take her to the Operating Room for ventral
hernia repair. On 10/1 , she was taken to the Operating Room and
had a ventral hernia repair. That operation was notable to be a
reducible umbilical hernia which was noted to be incarcerated
without any evidence of strangulation. The hernia was repaired
with Marlex and mesh. Please see the Operative Note for details.
The patient remained intubated after the operation and was taken to
the Recovery Room intubated. After a slow wean from the
ventilator , the patient was extubated later in the day on September and required four liters of oxygen by nasal prongs to maintain
O2 saturations between 90 and 94%. She also underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol post-operatively and did rule out.
Of note , the right calf had a palpable cord , lower extremity
non-invasives were scheduled , and the Cardiology Deep Venous
Thrombosis Service was consulted. They felt that her left lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis was chronic deep venous thrombosis
and venous insufficiency. They recommended Ted stockings and
subcutaneous Heparin. She was additionally seen by the Pulmonary
Service who suggested getting pulmonary function tests once the
patient was clinically stable and agreed to using Ted thigh-high
stockings. The Deep Venous Thrombosis Service recommended
thigh-high stockings with the pressure of 30 to 40 mm of mercury
during the day with Ted stockings regularly at night with the
continuation of subcutaneous Heparin until fully mobile. On
post-operative day three , the patient&apos;s nasogastric tube was
discontinued and her diet was advanced. Her Jackson-Pratt drain
was removed. On post-operative day four , the patient had regained
bowel sounds as well as had a bowel movement. Her oxygen
saturation was 94% on four liters and when the oxygen was removed ,
she had a room air saturation between 86 and 88%. She had an
echocardiogram to rule out evidence of pulmonary hypertension in
the setting of sleep apnea felt the most likely diagnosis in this
pickwickian appearing patient. Her echo was without evidence of
pulmonary hypertension. Her pulmonary function tests showed
decreased volume , decreased diffusing capacity , and decreased MIP.
The Respiratory Service recommended home oxygen therapy to maintain
saturations at 90% at rest and with ambulation. A trial of oxygen
at rest and with ambulation was done in the hospital to calculate
the dose of oxygen needed for home therapy. Pulmonary as well
recommended state study as an out-patient and pulmonary follow-up.
On post-operative day five , the patient was noted to have erythema
around her incision , probably a reaction to the tape , however , she ,
as well , had a low grade temperature to 100.1. Given that she had
had a mesh placed , she was started on antibiotic prophylaxis for
possible cellulitis. She was started on Cephradine 500 q.i.d. for
seven days. As well , further discussion was had with the
Respiratory Consultation Service. They felt that patient&apos;s problem
was chronic with hypoxemia leading to an elevated hematocrit and
that she would require home oxygen. The Deep Venous Thrombosis
Cardiology Service recommended repeating her lower extremity
non-invasives prior to discharge , continuing her on her 30 to 40 mm
of mercury stockings during the day , and Teds at night. She had a
follow-up lower extremity non-invasive on the day of discharge
which showed a chronic left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis
with venous insufficiency and no evidence of new deep venous
thrombosis. They recommended follow-up lower extremity
non-invasives after discharge as an out-patient. The patient was
discharged in good condition on June , 1994. She is
discharged on home oxygen at two liters by nasal prongs. With
this , she was able to maintain her O2 saturations greater than 90%.
On the date of discharge , her saturations were in the 94
percentile. She was to be monitored by Stuartmer Medical Center at home.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylox one to two tablets
q.3-4h. p.r.n. for pain , Colace , Dulcolax p.r.n. , and
Cephradine 500 q.i.d. for six days further. She has scheduled
follow-up in the Surgical Clinic January , ten days after
discharge , for follow-up of her chronic venous insufficiency in
EL HOSPITAL and the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Limas on March to
further evaluate her sleep apnea oxygen requirements.

VNA services at home , is a nonsmoker , and history of alcohol
abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Significant for mother with diabetes and father with hypertension
and alcoholism.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
A morbidly obese African-American male trached in no acute
distress. Pupils were equally , round , and reactive to light.
His oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes. His chest
has vented breath sounds. His heart is S1 and S2 , tachycardic
with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , sometimes irregularly
irregular. His abdomen is obese with a gallbladder drain , soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. His extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. Skin ,
he had healing vesicles on his nose and lips.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID: The patient with septic shock secondary to urosepsis and
acalculous cholecystitis secondary to quinolone-resistant E.
coli. He had a desensitization protocol for ceftriaxone to treat
E. coli , completed a 14-day course of ceftriaxone for urosepsis.
He had a biliary drain placed to decompress gallbladder on
11/6/05 .  A right upper quadrant ultrasound without dilated
ducts. This will stay in place for six weeks. Also , received a
14-day course of vancomycin for empiric coverage after 8/30/05
coag-negative Staph from the line. This was continued , as the
patient continued to be febrile. Other surveillance cultures
were negative. Vesicular lesions on 11/6/05 on the nose and
lips , received a seven-day course of acyclovir. While patient&apos;s
white blood cells count trending down and hemodynamically stable ,
continued to have daily fevers , usually spiking in the afternoon
and then defervescing without medication throughout the day.
LENIs on 5/26/05 showed no new DVTs , although limited due to
patient&apos;s body habitus. The patient&apos;s galactomannan was
negative. Both arterial line and central line changed 2/4/05 ,
eventually taken out. Fevers felt to be due to antibiotics , now
off all antibiotics with gradual resolution of fevers. ENT
evaluated for sinusitis. No
sinusitis on 10/10/05 .  The patient&apos;s LFTs were within normal
limits. Chest x-ray is clear. Sputum culture was notable for
yeast. Body habitus prevents chest , abdominal , and pelvic CT
scan.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was trached due to extensive soft
tissue and concern for airway collapse. The patient tolerating
trach with decreased secretions when started on glycopyrrolate ,
and the patient&apos;s trache tube was changed on 4/19/05 to a
Bivona #7.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient with known CAD , on beta-blocker ,
consider restarting aspirin , once therapeutic on Coumadin. The
patient has known ACE inhibitor allergy. The patient&apos;s fasting
lipid profiles were within normal limits , not on the statin.
Pump: The patient had an echo on 2/4/05 that showed mild to
moderately reduced LV function. Unable to assess the ejection
fraction due to limited study from the size , severe posterior

Discharge Date: 1/17/2005
ATTENDING: MARVIN , KERMIT M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Status post cardiac arrest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Orlikowski is a 54-year-old man with a history of diabetes ,
end-stage renal disease , CAD , long QT interval , seizure disorder ,
and mental status changes who presents following cardiac arrest.
The patient presented to his regular hemodialysis appointment at
Irun Adi Hospital on 2/20/05 where during his dialysis , he noted that he
began to feel strange. He had a questionable seizure earlier in
the day per history. During the dialysis , he became increasingly
confused and was sent for further evaluation to the Sidecoa Medical Center Emergency Room. At the Cleavexo Brock Hospital ED , an EKG was done ,
which showed tachycardia going in to torsade de pointes followed
by ventricular fibrillation. He underwent a DC cardioversion
shock at 200 joules and was converted to normal sinus rhythm.
The patient was then intubated , as he was being coded.
Furthermore , there is report of the patient developing a
tonic-clonic seizure during the bagging phase of intubation.
Follow this , a repeat EKG was obtained and showed a QT interval
of 540. His baseline is apparently around 510 milliseconds. His
electrolytes at that time were remarkable for potassium of 3.7 ,
bicarbonate of 30 , and magnesium level of 1.6 , and phosphate
level of 0.9. He did have a slightly elevated troponin level.
He was then transferred to the Centrah Steadmot Ain Medical Center for
further workup and management. On arrival , the patient was
intubated , sedated , with an amiodarone drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent.
2. End-stage renal disease with hemodialysis , on Monday ,
Wednesday , and Friday.
3. CAD , status post a non-ST elevation MI in 6/29 .
4. A long QT syndrome.
5. Seizure disorder.
6. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy complicated by gastritis.
7. Chronic pancreatitis.
8. History of mental status changes with increased ICP.
9. Peripheral neuropathy.
10. Peripheral vascular disease.
11. Penile amputation secondary to infected implant.
12. Depression.
13. Hep B and hep C positive.
ALLERGIES:
Tetracycline.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was noted to be afebrile. His blood pressure was
notable to be 240/79 and heart rate of 72. He was intubated on
arrival on assist-control volume setting with the tidal volume of
500 mL , 12 beats per minute , on 50% oxygen. He was saturating
100% on room air. Pulmonary exam was notable for mechanical
breath sounds without any wheezes , rhonchi or rales.
Cardiovascular exam was notable for regular rate and rhythm , soft
2/6 holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex , and 2+ pulses
distally. His abdominal exam was unremarkable. Extremity exam
was notable for status post left leg below-the-knee amputation.
Neurologically , the patient was unresponsive secondary to
sedation , but was able to move all extremities when the sedation
was decreased. He did responded ??_____?? purposefully to pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Torsade de pointes status post DC cardioversion: Given his
history of torsade de pointes requiring cardioversion , upon
presentation to Neysing Areid Risbanks Hospital , Mr. Mazikowski
electrolytes were vigorously repleted. He underwent an ischemic
workup for the etiology for his initial presentation. He
continued to have a prolonged QT interval and therefore medicated
failed to exacerbate his already long QT interval , at baseline
were discontinued. He was discontinued from his Celexa and
levofloxacin. Throughout the remainder of his hospital course ,
Mr. Gift was closely monitored via telemetry and was noted to
have no further events of ventricular tachycardia.
2. Ischemia: When he presented , the ischemic etiology for his
ventricular tachycardia was considered. He was maintained on
aspirin and also continued on his Plavix. A cardiac
catheterization was done on 7/24/05 , which showed 30% occlusion
of the left anterior descending proximal coronary artery , 65%
occlusion of the ramus , 30% occlusion of the mid circumflex
artery , 50% occlusion of the marginal 1 artery , and 100%
occlusion of the distal RCA. None of these lesions were felt to
have caused his ischemia such that it would have been the
etiological factor for his torsades. He was followed throughout
his hospital course by the Electrophysiology Service.
3. Hypertension: While in the CCU , the patient had an echo ,
which showed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
an ejection fraction of 55%. He was started on vigorous
after-load reduction , which was titrated to his blood pressure
throughout his hospital course. At the time of discharge , he was
taking Lopressor , lisinopril , Norvasc , Isordil , and hydralazine.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient was continued on his
repeat dialysis with close follow up from the Renal Service. He
underwent regular dialysis on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday while
at Apseph&apos;s Danale Hospital .  His electrolytes were followed
daily and repleted as needed.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient , although on presentation was
believed to have had a tonic-clonic seizure. He was maintained
on his Keppra throughout his course and was seizure-free while
hospitalized.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient presented with markedly
labile blood sugars. While admitted to the CCU , he was placed on
the Portland protocol in order to maintain tight glycemic
control. He was followed by the Endocrine Team , who recommended
switch to Lantus for basal control and regular insulin prior to
meals. His glucose levels were followed daily and his insulin
regimen was titrated in order to attain appropriate glycemic
control.
7. Nutrition: The patient was initially started on tube feeds
for nutrition. A NG tube was placed secondary to his altered
mental status. However , during his hospitalization , he had
multiple episodes of agitations , during which he pulled out his
NG tube. He was trialed with a soft diet after consultation with
the Speech and Swallow Service on 2/1 .  As he was able to
tolerate these p.o. feeds , this diet was continued.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
CONSULTANTS:
1. Electrophysiology Service.
2. Renal Service.
3. Endocrinology Service.
4. Speech and Swallow.
5. Physical therapy.
MEDICATIONS AT THAT TIME OF DISCHARGE:

than 100 , Lipitor 80 mg by mouth once daily , Nephrocaps one
tablet by mouth once daily , and Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
The patient is in no acute distress. He is cachetic appearing
male. Pulmonary exam is notable for breath sounds that are
coarse bilaterally. Upper airways sounds are prominent. Cardiac
sounds are distant. He does have a systolic ejection murmur
loudest at the apex. His abdomen is benign. There was some mild
tenderness noted to be in the epigastrium. However , there is no
rebound or guarding. His extremity exam is notable for status
post left above-the-knee amputation. The patient is to follow up
with his primary care physician and is to follow up with
Endocrinology and to continue his dialysis on Monday , Wednesday ,
and Friday. He is to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

1. SARCOIDOSIS.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4. STATUS POST PACEMAKER PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female
with a history of hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , and
with no known hx of CAD admitted with chest pain. She has had
several days of exertional chest pain characterized by substernal
burning pain which , at times , radiates to the left shoulder. It is
sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath without nausea and
occasional diaphoresis. She was seen in the Emergency Department
with chest pain on June , 1997 , with negative troponins and
negative cardiac enzymes. An exercise treadmill test on April , 1997 , for three minutes revealed a maximal heart rate of 127
and maximal blood pressure of 134/80. She experienced chest pain
with 1 millimeter of ST depression in V5 and T-wave inversions in
V4-V6. This study was interpreted as consistent with , but not
diagnostic ischemia. She was started on aspirin and atenolol. On the
morning of admission , she was walking to catch a bus and had an
episode of substernal chest burning lasting less than 10 minutes
with shortness of breath , but no nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis.
She came by cab to Rirel Carleo And for her scheduled
exercise ett/mibi test study and was noted to have T wave
inversions in II , III , F , and V3-V6.
On arrival to the Emergency Room , the patient was pain free. She
denied lower extremity edema and had mild orthopnea which was
unchanged. She denied bright red blood per rectum , and stools were
black secondary to iron supplementation. Hematocrit on November ,
1997 , was noted to be 29.3. The patient had been iron supplements
since that time. She had a history of colonic polyps.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Significant for a history of
sarcoidosis. Her last pulmonary test was in
April 1995 which showed an FEV 1 of 1.61 , 72% of predicted; FEV
1 ratio to FVC was 80 or 102% of predicted. FVC was 2.01 or 72% of
predicted. In the past , she has been treated with prednisone and
now uses Ventolin inhalers p.r.n. 2 ) History of seizure disorder.
3 ) Status post pacemaker placement in October 1996 for tachycardia
bradycardia syndrome. 4 ) Status post appendectomy. 5 ) Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer. 6 ) Adult
onset diabetes mellitus , diet-controlled. 7 ) History of left calf
deep vein thrombosis in 1993. 8 ) History of colonic polyps with a
colonic adenoma diagnosed in 1993.

Pravachol 20 mg q.h.s.;
aspirin 325 mg q. day; atenolol 0.5 mg b.i.d.; Dilantin 200 mg
b.i.d.; Ventolin inhaler p.r.n.; ferrous gluconate 325 mg t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and erythromycin , gives rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant female in no acute
distress. Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 97.9; heart rate 78; blood pressure 120/70;
respiratory rate 19. Saturation was 99% on two liters. Head ,
eyes , nose , and throat examination: Pupils were equal , round , and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx was
clear and edentulous. Jugular venous pressure was 8 centimeters.
No lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally , no bruits.
Lungs: Diffuse , dry rales. No wheezes. Cardiac: Regular rate
and rhythm. S4 present. 1/6 systolic murmur heard at upper left
sternal border. Abdomen: Cholecystectomy scar. Infraumbilical
midline scar. No masses. No hepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel
sounds. Rectal: Guaiac negative per the Emergency Room.
Extremities: Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally. No bruits. No
lower extremity edema. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses were 2+ bilaterally. Nonfocal neurological examination. No
motor or sensory deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray: Bilateral parenchymal opacities ,
most prominent in the right upper lung fields.
Stable and consistent with previous examinations from May ,
1997 , consistent with chronic sarcoidosis. Pacer wires were in
good position. Electrocardiogram on admission , April , 1997 in
the Emergency Room , normal sinus rhythm at 66. T-wave inversion in
I , T-wave inversion in II and AVF , biphasic T-waves in V2 , and
T-wave inversions in V3-V6. Slightly pronounced when compared with
previous electrocardiogram.
Sodium 143; potassium 5.1; chloride 108; bicarbonate 23; BUN 36;
creatinine 1.8; glucose 255. White count 6700; hematocrit 30.9;
platelets 143 , 000; MCV 85.1. Prothrombin time was 11.4. Partial
thromboplastin time was 25.2. INR was 0.9. CK was 79. Troponin
0.0. Dilantin: Less than assay. Hematocrit on November , 1997 ,
was 29.3. Cholesterol total was 258; LDH 43; LDL 166.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Talburt was admitted for a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol and underwent serial
electrocardiograms and her enzymes were studied. She was started
on Nitrol paste. Aspirin , linsinopril , and atenolol , were
continued. Given her low hematocrit as a possible etiology for
her ischemia , she was transfused with one unit of packed red cells.
Stools were guaiac neg and anemia workup was initiated. She was
continued on her albuterol inhale and nebulizers p.r.n.
On February , 1997 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed a 70% residual osteal diagonal stenosis , 0% left
anterior descending stenosis. A stent was placed in the diagonal
artery with 0% residual stenosis. Later than evening , the patient
began to complain of severe left arm pain radiating to her left
chest. Her electrocardiogram changes showed ST elevation in VI and
VII , and T-wave more inverted in VIV. She received morphine and
was already on a nitroglycerin drip , and she was taken back to the
catheterization laboratory. Her spectral study on February ,
1997 , revealed a 90% mid left anterior descending and 95% VI , and
her left anterior descending was stented at this time.
Following her two cardiac catheterizations , she experienced
intermittent atypical chest which was transient in nature without
sustaining any electrocardiogram changes. Her cardiac enzymes were
significant for a CK of 409 with an MB fraction o 21.
On October , 1997 , it was noted that her creatinine had risen to
3.1 , elevated from a level of 1.9 before the catheterization and a
diagnosis of radial contrast induced nephrotoxicity was made. Her
creatinine rose and rose to a peak level of 5.1 on May ,
1997 , and then began to decrease. At the time of discharge , it was
down to 2.2. The patient continued to have excellent urine output
throughout the rise in her creatinine and was normal by the time of
discharge.
Her laboratories at the time of discharge were a sodium of 141;
potassium 4.8; chloride 106; bicarbonate 20; BUN 31; creatinine
2.2; glucose 90. White count 6900; hematocrit 33.9; platelets were
203 , 000. She had an exercise tolerance test and ED study on
June , 1997 , which showed an essentially negative exercise
treadmill test and was a suboptimal study. She exercised for
approximately five minutes on submaximal exercise treadmill test
protocol with no evidence of ischemia , but low exercise tolerance.
Her medications at the time of discharge included: Ticlid 250 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. as needed for
shortness of breath; enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.;
atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual one
tablet q. 5 minutes times three for chest pain; and Dilantin 200 mg
p.o. b.i.d.
She is scheduled to followup with Dr. Doug Millis in her office
in one week and will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 3/16/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: LEFT HEMISPHERE CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT
SECONDARY TO OCCLUSIONS OF THE MIDDLE
CEREBRAL ARTERY
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT
2. PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY
3. DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE
4. UMBILICAL HERNIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Dorich is a 66-year-old right
handed gentleman with no previous
admissions to Tiftver Community , who presented on
27 of June , after having fallen out of bed at about 5:45 in the
morning. He was noted to be mute at the time and was unable to
move the right arm and leg. He was brought by ambulance to the
Emergency Room , where much of his motor deficits resolved , as well
as some of his speech deficit. This occurred within an hour.
There was no loss of consciousness associated with the fall , and
the patient was not noted to have any unusual movements or
verbalizations , or tongue biting , or incontinence. He was
&quot;stunned&quot; for a minute ( by the report of his son ) just after
falling. The patient denied headaches , vertigo , double vision ,
hoarseness or numbness , or nausea , vomiting , or palpitations. He
had had no previous neurological symptoms prior to this event.
There was also no chest pain. There was no history of high blood
pressure or heart disease , or recent fever and chills or sweats.
He had been feeling quite well up until this point. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: Significant for an umbilical hernia , which had been
present for many years. He also suffered from prostatism. In the
last year , he had regained much of the weight that he had lost
previous on special diet. SOCIAL HISTORY: He did not smoke nor
did he use alcohol or elicit drugs. There was no significant
family history of heart disease or strokes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a severely obese gentlemen ,
who had a blood pressure of 115/59 in the
right arm; with a respiratory rate of 12; heart rate of 72. He was
afebrile. HEENT: Remarkable for a slight bruise on the right
temple where the patient hit his head during the fall. The neck
showed no signs of meningismus. The carotids were poorly palpated
secondary to the thickness of his neck. The cardiovascular
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs or
rubs. There were no bruits. The lungs were clear. The abdomen
revealed umbilical hernia , but was otherwise benign. The
extremities had full pulses throughout , and a trace of edema.
There was no calf tenderness noted. On neurological examination ,
the patient was oriented x 3. He was now able to speak , and was
quite alert. He could register 3 words forward and 2 words
backwards. He could count from 20 to 1. His language was abnormal
with waxing and weaning worsening of functions. His meaning was
clear , but he did make errors , calling a pen and pencil. His
speech was mostly fluent but there were quite a few paraphasias.
There was decreased comprehension and decreased repetitions and
there was one prominent error in reading in which he repeatedly
read the &quot;leaf&quot; as &quot;deaf&quot;. There was no right/left confusion , and
the patient was able to write. There was no neglect noted.
Long-term memory was essentially intact and there were a few errors
with short term tasks. Cranial nerve examination revealed full
visual fields to confrontation with sharp discs and no evidence of
cholesterol emboli. The discs were sharp. The pupils equal round
and reactive to light and accommodation. Conjugate eye movements
in all directions. There was full sensation on the face to pin
prick. There was a slight decrease nasal labial fold on the right
and some decreased hearing on the right. The palate moved upward
bilaterally and the sternocleidomastoid was strong. The tongue
protruded to the midline. Motor examination revealed normal tone
throughout and to formal testing the patient had 5/5 power in all
extremities except the right iliopsoas which demonstrated 5-/5
power. There was mild right sided drift of the upper extremities.
The patient had sensory decrease to vibration on the right lower
extremity. Pin prick and light touch were within normal limits , as
was joint position sense. The patient was mildly uncoordinated
with slowing of rapid alternating movements in the right upper
extremity. There was normal finger-nose-finger maneuver and
heel-knee-shin maneuvers in both the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally. The gait was not assessed initially ( but during the
rest of the hospital course , was noted to be quite normal ).
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had fully normal electrolytes with a
glucose of 105; sodium 139; potassium 4.4; white
count 7.5; hemoglobin 13.5; hematocrit 39.8; platelets 225; PT and
PTT were 12.6 and 28.4 respectively; calcium was normal. Liver
function tests were normal. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without
any signs of ischemia. Carotid ultrasounds were done immediately ,
and the patient was noted to have normal carotids without
significant stenosis. A CT scan was obtained without contrast ,
showing evidence of an early left frontal parietal infarction on
the left. There was no evidence of hemorrhage , and there was no
mass effect noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service
and was started on Heparin , as it was felt that
his event had most likely been an embolic event. During the first
day , his speech waxed and wained , and by 2 of the hospitalization ,
his speech was clearly abnormal with marked deficits in speech
generation with many pauses and profound word finding difficulty.
Repetition and comprehension were somewhat better than the initial
presentation. A repeat CT scan was obtained showing no evidence
for bleeding. This CT scan , now 3 days from the initial event ,
showed an acute infarct in the posterior inferior left frontal lobe
and posterior temporal lobe , and extending into the sylvian
fissure. Again , there was no evidence of hemorrhage or mass
effect , and the patient was continued on Heparin.
Because the patient was unable to fit into the MRI scanner at
Vaplacea Memorial Medical Center , he had a diagnostic MRI done at the
Skilli Memorial Health Center , and this revealed , in addition to the original
lesion noted on CT scan , a second lesion , corresponding with an
occlusion of the posterior division of the middle cerebral artery.
This lesion was in the left parietal region. By the end of the
hospitalization , the patient&apos;s aphasia was quite clearly a very
mixed aphasia , with elements of poor comprehension , as well as
difficulties with fluency.
An investigation as to the cause of the patient&apos;s stroke was
initiated with an MR angiogram of the cerebral vasculature , which
revealed no significant carotid or posterior circulation defects.
An echocardiogram was done revealing normal ventricular function
with an ejection fraction of 55% without any wall motion
abnormality or thrombi noted. It was felt that the patient&apos;s
presentation warranted further review , and a transesophageal
echocardiogram was also done revealing an atrial septal defect , as
evidenced by significant positive bubble study. The patient was
therefore started on Coumadin. While the workup was being done ,
the patient also had an EEG that revealed abnormality consistent
with the 2 infarcts noted on MRI. These were not felt , however , to
be definite seizure phenomena. Coagulation studies were done
showing normal cardiolipin. Protein C was slightly elevated
protein S , a normal ANA , and a sed rate that was slightly elevated
at 26.
The patient was seen by the Speech Pathologist , and therapy was
begun , and this will continue as an outpatient.
The patient continued to have difficulties with voiding , with a
post void residual of 450 after voiding 400. He was seen by the
Urologist and was noted to have a quite large prostate. The PSA
was 14.6. The patient opted not to have surgical intervention
during this hospitalization or in near future. He was started on
Cardura at 1 mg q hs , which was slowly increased to 4 mg q hs , as
medical intervention for decreasing sphincter tone.
The patient also had some mild pain in the left knee with minimal
effusion , that was noted by x-ray. There was no evidence for
fracture. There was a small increase in his uric acid. He
responded quite nicely to Ibuprofen.
After day 3 , the patient&apos;s speech stabilized and gradually
improved , all be it very , very , slowly. He was therapeutic on his
Coumadin at the time of discharge , with his hopes that his INR will
be in the mid 2 range ( 2.3-2.8 ).
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Cardura 2 mg po q hs x 2 nights ,
then 4 mg po q hs every night
thereafter. 2. Coumadin 5.0 mg q hs to be monitored and adjusted
as needed in the near future. FOLLOW-UP CARE: The patient was
discharged in good condition to his home with the following
follow-up appointments: 1. Primary M.D. , Dr. Giovanni Behanna , at the
ON PHPU VALLEY HEALTH Clinic on 29 of October , at 10:20 am. 2. Dr. Maendel at the
Urology Clinic on 30 of January , at 3:30 pm. 3. Dr. Matthew Prokup in
the Neurology Clinic on 21 of November , at 2:00 pm. 4. The patient will
continued to receive speech therapy at his home through the
visiting nurses association. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: He is
discharged in good condition with full 5/5 strength in all 4
extremities , to his home.

Hospital Course:
+CV: No evidence of acute coronary event ( ekg , enzymes unremarkable ). Due
to med noncompliance ( pt ran out med ) , pt was hypertensive with sbp &gt;
200. Pt&apos;s home medications listed above were restarted and blood pressure
normalized to sbp 120-140&apos;s.
During hospitalization , CK&apos;s trended up ( peak 872 , at discharge 675 ) but
troponin stayed less than assay. Pt has long history of elevated CK&apos;s.
Suspect his elevation may be due to lipitor. Pt denied myalgias or chest
pain. Defer to pcp for consideration of switching to other statins that
may not cause elevation of CK. In interim , will pt will not be continued on
lipitor; we have also discharged pt on labetolol 800 mg BID as recommended
by his outpatient cardiologist at his most recent visit.
Pt also had episode of NSVT ( 12 beats ) during hospitalization. Echo
revealed concentric LVH with EF 45% , slightly decreased from prior; but
essentially unchanged from previous echo. EKG without changes as compared
with ekg 4/3 .  Discussed with cardiology service who felt that given EF and
history of LV dysfunction , no indication for pacemaker. Follow up arranged
with patient&apos;s cardiologist ( Dr. Rucki ) and pcp ( Dr. Bendit ).
+ID: ?C. diff. Pt reported several days worth of diarrhea daily. Given
h/o C. diff , started treating empirically. Pt was unable to provide stool
sample as he had no episodes of diarrhea during hospitalization. Given
h/o C. diff , will continue flagyl and lactobacillus as outpatient for 11
additional days.
+Renal: ESRD on HD. Pt dialyzed on admission with some improvement in BP.
+Endo: DM. Ct home regimen of lantus qam.
+Psych: Bipolar , agitation. During hospitalization , pt somewhat agitated
and not cooperative. Agitation responded well to trazodone and pt was
able to sleep overnight. Pt resides in group home with access to mental
health resources.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable

Discharge Date: 3/18/2005
ATTENDING: KEMERER , DEAN OMAR MD
SERVICE: Cardiology Usoslee Avenue , Ri Dar Cincogarlstock ,  22451
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Acute renal failure.
PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSIS: Ischemic cardiomyopathy , coronary artery
disease , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with neuropathy ,
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , polyarticular gout , elevated
CK , and osteoarthritis left hip.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Sheumaker is a 65-year-old gentleman
with known cardiomyopathy , coronary artery disease ,
osteoarthritis , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who
presented with a 1 week of progressive fatigue and shortness of
breath. In the prior 2 weeks , he had been started on
hydrochlorothiazide. He had been nauseated and vomiting as a
result of Percocet taken for his left hip pain with resulting
decreased p.o. intake. He was evaluated in his primary care
clinic and felt to be in decompensated heart failure.
In the Emergency Department , he was dehydrated and found to be in
acute renal failure , hyperkalemic , and uremic. He complained of
joint soreness , particularly in his third proximal
interphalangeal joints bilaterally. His BUN and creatinine were
182 and 4.8 respectively. His potassium 6.4 , his sodium 128 , and
his CPK 1356 , and his uric acid level 11.6. Issues in the
hospital included hyperkalemia , acute renal failure secondary to
dehydration , polyarticular joint soreness and left hip pain. For
his hyperkalemia , the patient was treated with calcium ,
gluconate , insulin , Kayexalate and his potassium level returned
to normal levels by hospital day #2. For his acute renal
failure , the patient was hydrated gently with 60 cc of normal
saline. The renal service was consulted and assisted with
management. The patient was urinating. Renal ultrasound was
normal. Renal function returned to baseline and his creatinine
at discharge was 1.4. His baseline is 1.6. With correction of
his renal function , the patient regained strength. For his joint
symptoms , Rheumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentesis
of the left knee and diagnosed polyarticular gout. No treatment
was initiated in the setting of impaired renal function and a
concern for fluid retention. He has a followup appointment with
Rheumatology in September 2005. For his hip pain , his orthopedist ,
Dr. Schuchmann , evaluated him for possible future hip surgery.
Neurology was consulted regarding atrophy of thenar muscles and
elevated CPK. They did not feel a secure diagnosis could be made
and recommended following daily CPK , which trended down over the
course of hospitalization. Followup appointment in Neurology was
scheduled to discuss essential tremor and further investigate the
muscle wasting with nerve conduction studies and EMG if necessary
based on CPK levels. The patient had an echocardiogram on
hospital day #2 , which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% ,
no pericardial effusion , and hypokinesis of the mid and distal
septum , mid and distal inferior wall and decreased global right
ventricular function. The patent foramen ovale was visualized.
At discharge , the patient was afebrile , hemodynamically stable ,
euvolemic , ambulating , and saturating on room air , and on a
stable medical regimen. He was followed by VNA at home starting
February , 2005 , for INR checks.
Followup appointments for Cardiology , Neurology , and Rheumatology
were put in place. The patient was asked to contact his primary
care physician to schedule a followup appointment.
On admission , the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.

CC:Left Lower Chest Pain
HPI: 68 yo man with h/o DM HTN hyperlipidemia , asthma presented to
the ED with L-sided chest/flank pain. Pt was in his usual
state of health until he awoke from bed to urinate the day of admission.
Upon standing , he felt dull CP. lasted X 7 hours , non-radiating , located
beneath mid-clavicle. No SOB , no N/V , did experience transient positional
lighthededness upon standing. Pain persisted for several hours before he
called his PCP ( RK ) around 6pm. Was instructed to go to the ED at that
time. At home he self-measured SBP to be 236 systolic ( baseline SBP at home
is 160-180 ). Pt admitted that he had not taken BP meds for several days.
Chest pain was reproducible on chest palpation. Initial biomarkers: TnI
0.11 , CK 232 , MB 1.9. In ED started on heparin , lopressor ( 5mg IV , 25mg
PO ) , ASA 325. No relief from TNG gtt , relief from morphine sulfate.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76 year old woman with CHF , moderate MR , PAF , HTN , and obesity who
presented with left upper arm pain since 3 pm the day of admission.
Denies any SOB , CP , N/V , diaphroresis. Took 5 baby aspirin at
home without relief of pain. Pain came on at rest. No history of
recent trauma. In ED , MSO4 relieved most of pain. Pain was noted to be
positional , increasing when arm is stretched down. Reports
increasing SOB over last several months , increased leg edema with 10
lb weight gain. No orthopnea or PND. PE: HR 58-61 , BP 141/81 98% RA.
PE: tenderness to palpation over L deltoid with pain with resistance to
abduction ( +supraspinatus involvement ). Full ROM in bilateral
shoulders. Chest: CTA bil. Neck: JVP 7 cm. ECG: 1st degree AVB , no
ischemic changes. CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary changes. Initial
enzymes flat. BNP 120
Hospital course.
The shoulder pain was felt to be secondary to supraspinatus
tendonitis/strain. The patient was advised to take a short course of
ibuprofen and was given shoulder exercises to do by physical therapy.
In addition , patient reports increased leg edema , SOB , and weight
gain. She ruled out for MI by enzymes and ECGs. By exam , much of the
changes in her legs appeared chronic. She did not appear to be in
respiratory CHF by exam or BNP. She does admit to dietary
indiscretions over the past few weeks. She was kept on her current
medications doses , including lasix 80 mg BID and instructed to keep a
daily weight log. A follow-up appointment was made for her with Dr.
Roginson on 6/3/03 .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Daily weights each am. Please record to show Dr. Ciminera .
2. Low salt , fluid-restricted diet
3. Ibuprofen 400 mg three to four times per day until you see Dr.
Pruzansky for shoulder pain. Please take with food.
4. Shoulder exercises as demonstrated by physical therapy.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:

Discharge Date: 1/17/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year-old male with a
history of peripheral vascular
disease , hypertension , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease , aortic stenosis , and status post bilateral
lower extremity bypass grafts who presented to the hospital with
increasing left lower extremity pain. He was taken to angiography
at which time tPA infusion was commenced. He is most recently
status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of
2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has been
developing increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot to
the point where he was not able to ambulate. In angiography , he
was found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity vein
graft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast and
minimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. Myocardial
infarction. Hypertension. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus. Aortic stenosis. He is status post a
left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of 2001. A revision
with cephalic vein to dorsalis pedis in July of 2001. He is
status post a right femoral to peroneal in September of 2000 and a right
fourth toe amputation in September of 2000.
MEDICATIONS: Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg
q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg q.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. ,
Amlodipine 5 mg q.d. , Imdur 30 mg q.d. , and Toprol 100 mg q.d. and
enteric coated aspirin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient first underwent angiography at which
time they found that the vein graft was occluded.
He underwent tPA treatment and was brought back to angiography.
This time they did not find necessarily any improvement. The
conduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a high
grade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. He was
taken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremity
thrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. Status post that
procedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain and
hypotension. An ECG was performed , as well as troponin drawn ,
revealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. The
cardiology service was called and the patient was admitted
post-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. At that time he was
managed medically for a few days. Based on his severe aortic
stenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiac
surgery service was consulted. He was scheduled to see cardiac
surgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we were
going to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. He did have a
bout of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery.
On 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a right
dominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , a
discreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending
artery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the left
circumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginal
branch of the left circumflex artery. He has a discreet 80% lesion
in the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence of
severe aortic stenosis. During catheterization this revealed an RA
pressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of
31. He had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of
2.1.
Based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patient
was taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with Dr. Opfer and Dr.
Gack for an aortic valve replacement with a #23
Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty with
an Alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass graft
times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and left
radial to posterior descending artery. Postoperatively he
underwent our routine care and went to the Cardiac Surgical
Intensive Care Unit where he generally did well.
He remained on his aspirin and Lopressor , as well as Coumadin. He
was mildly tachycardic and his Lopressor dose was adjusted.
Because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the Portland
protocol and remained on a full ten-day course of Flagyl and
Cefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. On postoperative day #1
he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able to
ambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is not
a candidate to go home immediately but a candidate for
rehabilitation. He has been taken off his Portland protocol and
his staples have been discontinued.
On his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions ,
as well as stable sternum. He is now currently on room air and
will be discharged to rehabilitation.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.hs to
maintain INR between 2 and 3 , aspirin , Diltiazem 30
mg t.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. , Colace 100 mg t.i.d. , Nexium 20
mg q.d. , Niferex-150 b.i.d. , Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d. , and Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. with CZI sliding scale.

Discharge Date: 8/12/2005
ATTENDING: GOETZE , BURTON M.D.
DATE OF BIRTH: 3/23/1927 .
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hypovolemia and fatigue.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease , severe anxiety ,
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , and 2+
mitral regurgitation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post silent MI and
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , who
has a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented with
fatigue and shortness of breath. On the day of admission , the
patient took an extra dose of Lasix because he thought that he
might be fluid overloade. In the emergency room , it was thought
that he appeared dry and he was admitted for volume
resuscitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , silent MI in
1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with GI
bleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction
previously reported at 20% in October 2005 , 2+ mitral
regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 20 mg to 40 mg daily , aspirin
325 daily , Lipitor 5 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 daily , Valium 5 mg
t.i.d. p.r.n. , Accupril 5 mg daily and Aleve p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa causes rash and ciprofloxacin causes
hallucinations.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an Irish descendent. He lives
alone with many cats. Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco or
illicit drugs. He is retired.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , heart rate 112 ,
blood pressure 153/90 with orthostasis , respiratory rate 18 , 97%
oxygen on room air. General: No acute distress , alert. Pupils
are equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation

to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Tachycardic with occasional
premature heartbeats. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen:
Nondistended , soft and nontender. Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: No edema , clubbing , or cyanosis. Neuro: The
patient was oriented. Cranial nerves III through XII intact.
Strength is 5/5 throughout. The sensation was intact throughout.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient appeared dry and
was resuscitated with one liter of IV fluids. The patient&apos;s
Lasix was held initially on admission. On hospital day #2 , he
was looking well. His weight was 151 pounds which was suspected
to be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.
By 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of Lasix daily so that he would stay
euvolemic. He received intermittent IV Lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainder
of his hospitalization and his p.o. Lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.
daily. His captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. He
tolerated that dose and was switched to Accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. He underwent an
echocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetation
on the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. This question of a
vegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and blood
culture were sent. The patient&apos;s temperature had been low on
admission , since there was some concern that he could be
developing sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood cultures
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. He was seen by
Cardiology , who did not think that this echo result required
further intervention and suspected that it represented a flail
tricuspid valve leaflet. The patient&apos;s troponin
One troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and then
another troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF and
acute hepatitis. He recently had a negative stress echo at the
Laketon Medical Center , so no additional stress testing
was pursued during this admission. He was switched to Lopressor
25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin was
discontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalities
which will be discussed below. He was monitored on telemetry
which demonstrated frequent PVCs and some NSVT. This
should be readdressed in Cardiology Clinic. Cardiology decided to hold off on
placing an AICD and was to see him as an outpt.
2. GI/renal: On the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusion
and delirium. He also developed an oxygen
requirement the night before. His labs on morning were notable
for a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure with
hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9
to 25 ). He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for
bartonella as he had many cats. He was empirically started on mucomyst and
acyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenol
toxicity or HSV. He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this was
cancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. He had a RUQ with dopplers which
was negative. The etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis was
never identified throughout the admission. Cardiology did not think that any
of this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stopped
once his cultures were negative for multiple days. GI though he could of had
shock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. His tylenol level was
normal and his hep seriologies were negative. His labs had all normalized by
admission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward.
3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question of
vegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsis
although that never panned out. He has a history of feeding
stray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. They take a
long time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. He had been
placed on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued on
the 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. He had a CT scan of his
chest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. He had ground
glass opacities on his CT chest which were felt to be due to CHF when reviewed
with the radiologist. He remained afebrile during the admission.
4. Psych: Early on during the patient&apos;s admission , he did have
several episodes of tachypnea at rest. They were not positional in nature
and resolved with verbal consolation and redirection and
deep breath. No associated desaturation at that time. The
patient has a history of anxiety and reported that that prompted
him to increase his Lasix dose at home. He refused psychiatric
consultation or social work involvement. His Valium had
initially been initiated but it was held in the setting of
abnormal LFTs. He had no further anxiety attacks after that. It
is likely that he has mild baseline dementia. His delirium
resolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient had a little bit of difficulty
ambulating and was seen by Physical Therapy who did think that
further physical therapy would be appropriate. The patient
refused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning to
go home with services including physical therapy at home.
6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it was
noted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady decline
throughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. There
was concern that this could represent heparin induced
thrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. He was placed
lepirudin which was chosen instead of Argatroban because
Argatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.
His initial PF4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber later
changed the result to negative. Based on this discrepancy another PF4 was
sent which was borderline positive. As per the hematology consult , they felt
that despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylactic
anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in the
future until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily ,
Toprol XL 25 mg daily , Accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily.
DIET: Low sodium.
ACTIVITY: As tolerated with supervision and advised by the
physical therapist.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Dougall is the patient&apos;s new PCP at
the GHAM MILL RIDOWN MEDICAL CENTER clinic at the Atl Hospital , he has an
appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr.
Alquisira was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until you
are cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. Weigh
yourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow up
appointment. If you develop light headedness , shortness of
breath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about ,
call your doctor or return to the Pi Hospital emergency room for evaluation.

RADIOLOGIC DATA: Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no evidence of
portal vein thrombosis. Portable chest x-ray on 10/27/05 showed
the lung volumes considerably decreased from the previous exam on
9/29/05 .  There is hazy opacity in the lower lung sounds
particularly on the right suggesting mild edema. There also
appears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is again
noted. On 10/27/05 , CAT scan of the abdomen showed no apparent
source of infection , no collection or abscess , limited study
secondary to lack of IV contrast , mild ascites , bilateral pleural
effusions right greater than left with subsegmental atelectasis ,
presacral edema and cardiomegaly with left coronary artery
calcification. CAT scan of the chest on 10/27/05 showed
bilateral small pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema and
small volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular ground
glass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis but
somewhat discrete , cannot exclude septic emboli but would be very
localized. A head CT on 9/29/05 showed no acute intracranial
abnormality.

increase that to 100 , and then 200 intravenous Lasix twice a day
and added 500 milligrams of Diuril twice a day. The patient began
to respond to the initial diuresis. Was unable to obtain an MRI to
evaluate her renal arteries , secondary to claustrophobia and
orthopnea. On July required addition of clonidine for not
well controlled blood pressure into the 180s and 190s/100 , .
Changed Captopril to ramipril for better lipophilic absorption. On
July Lasix was increased and Clonidine was also increased
from 2.5 to 5 for better diuresis and blood pressure control. The
patient was noted to have a hyperproliferative normal MCV anemia ,
was begun on erythropoietin; however , her level came back to 15
which is normal limits. An echocardiogram in October 2000 showed an
ejection fraction of 60% , normal size and function , 2-3+ mitral
regurgitation. A repeat echocardiogram done on April
showed 4+ mitral regurgitation with decreased function and an
ejection fraction of 45-50%. The patient had a chest x-ray that
showed continued pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , compared to
admission , somewhat improved. Sputum was done and had a gram stain
showing 4+ polys , gram positive cocci in clusters and chains , and a
culture which had 1+ oral flora. On March the patient
continued to diuresis well. On August creatinine to 2.6 up
from 2.2. Continued her Norvasc and Clonidine. On January ,
the patient&apos;s creatinine rose to 3.0. Held her diuresis and her
blood pressure medications. The patient was orthostatic. MRI/MRA
showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis and echocardiogram
showed mild mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of
45-50%.

ATTENDING: JARED PATTER MD
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Roberto Holk , MD
SERVICE: General Medical Cam
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Syncope
LIST OF PROBLEMS , DIAGNOSES: Pneumonia , coronary artery disease ,
non-ST elevation MI , diabetes mellitus , prostate cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old man
with multiple medical problems including aortic stenosis with
valve area 0.9cm , coronary artery disease , status post CABG/PCI ,
prostate cancer with question NSCLC vs lung metastasis , asbestos
exposure , asthma who presents with cough and shortness of breath.
Three days prior to admission the patient was seen in the ED and
not admitted. As family felt he was at his baseline in terms of
shortness of breath and he was started on prednisone and
discharged on a Combivent inhaler. The morning of admission the
patient was in the bathroom using the toilet when he fell and had
a loss of consciousness of several minutes , .per patient&apos;s
girlfriend. The patient did not remember the event. When seen
in the ED his vitals were: Temperature 99.9 , heart rate 91 ,
respirations 36 , BP 132/61 , oxygen saturation 89% on room air
which improved to 97% on 3 liters. The patient was treated with
levofloxacin and clindamycin and had a chest xray showing a left
lower lobe opacity. At baseline the patient does not use oxygen.
He can walk approximately 50 yards on a flat surface without
being limited by shortness of breath , although he is limited by
some leg pain. He does not have stairs at home. He has never
had syncope before this episode. He also noted cough with specks
of blood in his sputum the day prior to admission as well as a
burning pain in his chest or stomach. He denied any GI symptoms
and any dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient is notable for:
1. Coronary artery disease status post CABG 1998 x4 , status post
PCI 2003 x 2 stents.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension.
4. Aortic stenosis , aortic valve area 0.9cm. , September 2003.
5. Lung metastasis VA non-small cell lung cancer from metastatic
prostate cancer.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency secondary to hypertension and
diabetes.
7. Peptic ulcer disease.

11. History of GI bleed.
12. History of diverticulosis.
MEDICATIONS AT ADMISSION: Aspirin 81mg q.d. , folate 1mg q.d. ,
Imdur 30mg q.d. , , NPH insulin 21 units q.a.m. and 11 units
q.p.m. , Lipitor 20mg q.h.s. , Losartan 50mg q.d. , Norvasc 10mg

Xanax 0.5mg b.i.d. prn and Casodex 50mg po q.d.
ALLERGIES: Patient has no known drug allergies.
He wishes to be DNR/DNI.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for a troponin of 0.89 ,
creatinine of 2.3 , Hct 30.5 , WBC 22.15. Chest x-ray revealed a
left lower lobe opacity , question post obstructive pneumonia.
EKG revealed irregular inferior lead T wave inversions and a new
Q in lead 3 , also T wave inversion in the lateral leads , lost R
waves in V2 and V3 compared to earlier EKG of February 2004.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for a temperature
of 99.9 , heart rate 91 , BP 132/61 , respirations 36 , satting 96%
on 3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress. His JVP was
flat. His heart exam was notable for a 3/6 diamond shaped
systolic murmur at the base. Lungs had diminished breath sounds
bilaterally and crackles over the left lower lobe. He did have
wheezes. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended. Rectal
exam was guaiac negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular. Patient has history of critical aortic
stenosis with valve area of 0.9 cm2. He did present with syncope
ultimately of unknown cause , but possibly related to his AS. At
presentation he also had an non-ST elevation MI with peak
troponin of 0.89. This did trend down in the days following
admission. Four days following admission the patient also had an
episode of acute pulmonary edema which was thought to be ischemic
in nature. This did resolve with Lasix and patient was seen by
Cardiology consult who reviewed the case and confirmed that this
patient is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve repair. It
was also felt that the risks of valvuloplasty would outweigh the
potential benefits and that percutaneous intervention via
catheterization likewise was not indicated at this time given the
patients multiple other comorbidities. The patient will follow
up in Cardiology Clinic with Dr. Ralph Flato . She would
like to see him one to two weeks after discharge and her office
will contact patient&apos;s family to set up appointment.
2. Infectious Disease. Infiltrates seen on chest x-ray at
admission felt to be pneumonia. The patient was treated with a
10 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl and was discharged on no
antibiotics.
3. Pulmonary. The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
during this admission. He was discharged on 30mg of prednisone
with instructions to taper 10mg every 3 days starting the day
following discharge.
4. Endocrine. At the time of admission the patient was on a
regimen of NPH 21 units q.a.m. and 11 units q.p.m. This was
adjusted over the course of his hospitalization and at the time
of discharge he is discharged on 32 units of NPH q.a.m.and 6
units of NPH q.p.m.
5. Renal. Patient had some acute renal failure at admission
likely related to his cardiac status and some intravascular
volume depletion. His creatinine did normalize and he was at
baseline at the time of discharge.
6. Hematology. Patient&apos;s hematocrit did fall gradually over the
time of his admission and he was transfused of one unit packed
red blood cells in order to maintain his hematocrit greater than
30.
PLAN: The patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition on 10/17/05 .

Discharge Date: 9/13/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: IDIOPATHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old Hispanic
female with a history of idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy for the past ten years. Patient has been
managed medically , however , recently , the patient&apos;s heart failure
has progressed to the point where conventional therapy is unable to
sustain her. The patient was admitted in September 1993 with dyspnea and
chest pain. At that time , the patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction and was discharged home on exogenous oxygen therapy.
Patient returned shortly thereafter with shortness of breath and
was begun on intravenous Dobutamine. She was subsequently
discharged home after her heart failure resolved. Patient ,
however , returned a third time with similar complaints of shortness
of breath and dyspnea and remained in the hospital awaiting a heart
transplant. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of
non-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a history of
treated tuberculosis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Patient has a
history of total abdominal hysterectomy and right
salpingo-oophorectomy. Patient has no known tobacco or ethanol
history. Catheterization on May demonstrated a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 38 with a pulmonary artery pressure of
80 systolic/50 diastolic. Cardiac index was 1.4 and an echo
demonstrated severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection
fraction of between 25 and 30%. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , and
two liters nasal cannula O2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a sickly appearing female who
was short of breath. HEENT: Unremarkable.
NECK: Remarkable for jugular venous distention to the angle of the
jaw. CARDIAC: III/VI holosystolic murmur appreciated with an S3
gallop. ABDOMEN: Liver was 13 to 14 cm. Otherwise , the abdomen
was soft. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to the mid shin.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN was 24 , creatinine 1.2 , PT was 16.1 ,
PTT was 34 , white count was 8 , hematocrit
49% , and digoxin was 1.4. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 110
with a left bundle-branch block pattern and first degree AV block.
Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly and liver function tests were
grossly normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient underwent a heart transplant on October
without perioperative difficulty. The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediately
post-operatively and remained there for her first several days
post-operatively. The patient&apos;s early post-operative course was
complicated by right sided heart dysfunction and elevated PA
pressures. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular
function. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
post-operatively and was managed on Dobutamine and Inocor. As PA
pressures remained elevated , the patient was switched to Milrinone
and her other pressors were weaned off gradually. The patient had
chest tubes left in place for approximately twelve days
post-operatively at which time the chest tubes were discontinued.
Patient&apos;s Swan was removed on post-operative day ten and CVP
monitoring was used to estimate right heart function. The
patient&apos;s Milrinone was gradually weaned off and the patient&apos;s CVP
remained in the 12 to 16 mm range. The patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor where she did well. The patient was
biopsied twice prior to discharge , both times demonstrating no
rejection. Of note , the patient appeared to develop Cyclosporin
toxicity early in her post-operative course with rapidly rising
creatinine levels and elevated liver function tests. The patient
was placed on Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. and subsequently given a
seven day course of OKT3 after which time the patient was restarted
on her Cyclosporin with no ill effect. The patient was noted to
have a left sided pleural effusion that was tapped approximately
two and a half weeks into the patient&apos;s post-operative period. 400
cc of pleural fluid was removed which grew no bacteria out. The
patient&apos;s effusion was followed by chest X-Ray and was noted again
to reaccumulate. Approximately one and a half weeks later , a chest
tube was placed with the recovery of approximately 700 cc of fluid.
This was done with ultrasound guidance. The chest tube remained in
place approximately five days and was subsequently removed. A
residual small left pneumothorax was noted. This pneumothorax was
unchanged over the ensuing three days after chest tube removal and
the patient was discharged home with a stable small left
pneumothorax.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Patient is discharged home on
Dapsone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 225 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Imuran 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Magnesium Gluconate 1 gram q.i.d. ,
Procardia XL 90 mg p.o. q.d. , Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Prednisone 30 mg p.o. q.d. , Humulin NPH 18 units subcutaneously
q.a.m. , Lasix 40 mg q.a.m. q.d. , K-Dur 40 mEq p.o. q.d. , and Serax
15 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. for agitation. The patient is to
follow-up with the Transplant Clinic as well as the Endocrine
Clinic and will receive VNA nursing care at home for wound checks.

with another presyncopal event. HPI: Patient was in his USOH until the
DOA when he was coming from the bathroom ( post
micturation ) and started feeling lightheaded , noted that
his peripheral vision was darkening , and noticed
some nausea. He was able to make his way to the bed
to lie down. He believes that he never
lost consciousness but was very close. He notes
this episode is characteristic of his last 2
episodes of presyncope. He notes no chest pain , SOB ,
or diaphoresis during the event. Once he
was conscious he called EMS for transport to the
MCMC .  Of note , he was here at the GGH about 6 weeks
ago for a rule out MI , which was negative. Review

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: &quot;Anxiety in my chest&quot;
ID/Dx: Pt is a 44 y.o. woman with h/o of type II DM on insulin ,
morbid obesity , and anxiety who presents with chest tingling and SOB.
Pt was in her EBAMH until yesterday when after a large meal ,
late at night , she awoke with a strange feeling in her chest which
she could not describe - this feeling was associated with some air
hunger and mild nausea. No diaphoresis , radiation. Denies
pain , or previos sx like this. EKG and CXR were normal.
*** Status at discharge
VS: AF BP: 135/80 HR: 80-90 RR 16 O2sat: 100%
RA PULM: CTAB. CXR nl
CV: RRR nl s1/s2. no m/r/g. No EKG changes
RENAL: Cr 1.0
NEURO: A&amp;O x 3. nonfocal exam
** RELEVANT PMHX As in HPI
** ALLERGIES: Bactrim --&gt; rash
** Impression: 44F h/o DM2 , obesity , and anxiety d/o presents with
strange chest sensation. EKG , enzymes normal. MIBI showed severe perfusion
deficit , however , cardiac cath showed clean coronaries. Her symptoms could
still be explained by GERD or anxiety , with the perfusion deficit either aa
byproduct of the patient&apos;s size or caused by transient vasospasm.
*** Hospital Course and Plan by system
GI/FEN- Pt was maintained on 100U NPH , with lispro SS for meals. She had
intermittent reflux pains which were helped with H2 blocker. She should
continue on H2 blocker at home for these symptoms.
CV- cardiac enzymes x 2 were negative with no ischemic EKG changes. Stress
MIBI performed as inpatient with results as above. The study was limited
due the patient&apos;s size. D/C with ASA , BBlocker.
Resp- Baseline CXR - clear. No shortness of breath throughout her hospital
stay.
Renal- Cr 1.0 , eGFR 76. Her elevated Cr may reflect increased creatinine
production ( due to obesity ) vs. renal insufficiency.
Endo- Diabetes as above. Also h/o of hyperthyroidism , however , TSH and
free T4 were normal.
Pt was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. To follow-up with
Dr. Fischhaber in next two weeks.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please follow-up with your primary care physician in the next two weeks.
Return to the emergency department if you feel severe chest discomfort or
new shortness of breath.

Discharge Date: 9/25/2003
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: NECROTIZING FASCIITIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73-year-old female with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus and critical AS , who presented to the Emergency Department
from her primary care Er/ Neslath Community Hospital Of office presenting with a
right thigh mass present x 4 days. The patient was unable to
ambulate secondary to this abscess pain , patient with chills and
fevers to 102. Her glucose had become difficult to control since
the start of the abscess , and she presented to the Emergency
Department tachycardic and hypotensive.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history includes
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , morbid
obesity , critical AS , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and
anemia.
MEDICATIONS: Her home medications include Glyburide , Metformin ,
hydrochlorothiazide , Protonix , Lipitor , and Zestril.
ALLERGIES: Allergies include Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: In the Emergency Department here at
the Merso Ri Riska Hospital , her temperature was
101.5 , her heart rate was 128 , blood pressure 103/52 , and she was
breathing regularly , saturating 98% on room air. She was generally
a mildly ill appearing obese female. Cardiovascularly , she was
tachycardic and regular. She had a 2/6 systolic murmur louder on
the right. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her
abdomen was soft and obese , nontender , with audible but low bowel
sounds. Rectal exam was trace guaiac-positive by report. Her
extremities showed a large right thigh abscess with a boil
immediately below the pannus , with positive erythema , tenderness
down to the knee and up to the groin. There was no labial or
perirectal involvement.
LABS ON ADMISSION: BUN of 73 , creatinine of 3.8 , and a glucose of
357. White blood cell count of 18.4. EKG on
admission showed sinus tachycardia , with some T wave inversion , and
chest x-ray showed some mild pulmonary edema. The UA showed some
trace blood and trace leukocyte esterase.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was taken emergently to the operating
room for an incision and drainage of this
abscess , which was believed to be a necrotizing fasciitis.
Postoperatively , the patient remained intubated and was in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit. She was started on NeoFed for
control of her blood pressure to get it to the 70s , and was
receiving metoprolol and esmolol for a heart rate that had gone up
to the 130s. She was on triple antibiotics for full coverage and
treatment of her infection. On postoperative day 1 , the patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit. She was awake and appeared
comfortable on fentanyl for analgesia. She was evaluated by
Brookstibu Health Cardiology. She continued to need Levophed for
her blood pressure. Her cardiac enzymes and EKGs were being
continuously followed for evaluation of cardiac complications. She
continued to be on a ventilator and her diabetes was controlled
with an insulin drip. On postoperative day 2 , Plastic Surgery was
consulted and continued to follow the patient for future
necessitating closure of this right thigh wound. On postoperative
day 3 , patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit. Blood pressure
was improving , NG tube was removed , and a diet was started. By
postoperative day 4 , the patient was feeling well. She remained in
the Intensive Care Unit. She was tolerating Percocet for pain.
The wound appeared to have healthy tissue. She continued to
necessitate an insulin drip. The cultures on the wound showed
positive Enterococci and Corynebacter. She continued to be on
vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl for these microbes. On
postoperative day 4 , she was transferred to a regular nursing floor
in stable condition. On the regular nursing floor , the patient
continued to do well , tolerating all her diabetes meds by mouth.
Her vital signs were stable , with blood pressures 140/70s and a
heart rate ranging in the 70-75s. On postoperative day 8 , a VAC
sponge was placed on the wound , rehab screening was initiated , and
on postoperative day 9 the patient was transferred to a
rehabilitation facility. She was in stable condition. She was
working with Physical Therapy. She was tolerating a regular diet
and tolerating all of her medications , with continued stable vital
signs. Her wound showed healthy tissue and was covered with a VAC
sponge , that needs to be changed every three days. She continues
to be on triple antibiotics , and on the day of discharge she is day
9 of a 21-day course. Her vancomycin is dosed daily , depending on
her vancomycin level , that must be drawn also daily. Patient is to
follow up with Dr. Malady in one week and is to follow up with
Plastic Surgery in three weeks for evaluation of closure of the
wound. Patient is to follow up with her primary care physician and
her Princoness- Caken Valley Medical Center cardiologist as needed after discharge from
rehab.
Her discharge medications include vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , heparin 5000 U subcu t.i.d. , a sliding
scale of regular insulin , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. day 9 of 21 ,

Discharge Date: 9/21/2005
ATTENDING: VAL YAFAIE M.D.
This discharge summary covers admission 7/30/05 until 9/26/05
PRIMARY ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: Familial cardiomyopathy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old
man with familial cardiomyopathy and a last ejection fraction of
50% well known to the heart failure service secondary to multiple
admissions for decompensated CHF in the setting of poor medical
and dietary compliance presents with gradual fatigue and
increasing abdominal girth , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , and feeling &quot;fluid overloaded.&quot; He denies any chest
pain , fevers , chills , or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Familial cardiomyopathy , history of an
AICD placed in 2001 , last ejection fraction of 50% with a
biventricular pacing , and severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 , Isordil 30 t.i.d. ,
spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 20
once a day , and folate 5 once a day.
ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitors cause a cough and rash and lisinopril
causes cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smoked 2 packs per day times
approximately 10 years and drinks occasional ethanol. He denies
any history of other drug use. He is married and is with 2
children. He does not work currently secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He also has a brother who is status post cardiac
transplant.
EXAMINATON DATA: Temperature 96 , Pulse 97 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
and oxygen saturation 97 on room air. Admission weight 83.8
kilograms. JVP was greater than the angle of the jaw. Cardiac
exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the
apex. Respiratory exam showed a few bibasilar rales. Abdomen
was distended with mild shifting dullness. There was trace
bilateral extremity edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: Creatinine 1.5 , sodium 129 , potassium 2.7 ,
magnesium 2.2 , ALT 32 , AST 31 , hematocrit 40.6 , white blood cell
count 7.3 , platelets 281 , INR 1.2 , PTT 35.4 , and BNP 594.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: This is a 36-year-old man with familial
cardiomyopathy admitted for CHF exacerbation.
Problem#1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted in
decompensated failure. He reports compliance with his
medications; however , likely some component of this
decompensation is secondary to dietary indiscretion with foods
and fluids. The patient was diuresed during his hospital stay
initially with intravenous torsemide; however , this was
unsuccessful and a Lasix drip with BNP drip was started on
hospital day #3. He reached a total weight loss of approximately
2 to 3 kilograms and was converted to oral medicines including
torsemide. Moreover , he failed to maintain a stable weight on
this regimen and ultrafiltration was attempted. That removed
approximately 900 cc of fluids. This failed secondary to
intravenous access clotting and the patient&apos;s frustration with
having to lying still. The patient was subsequently converted to
oral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5
b.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. Per the
patient&apos;s request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with this
hospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. He
reported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff and
with Dr. Adamski and although we repeatedly stressed the importance
of free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued to
be noncompliant with this while inhouse. At the time the patient
was discharged , it was felt that he was not optimal
hemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated that
he would return if his condition worsened.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 once a day , Isordil 10
t.i.d. metolazone 5 b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide
200 b.i.d. , and K-Dur 60 b.i.d.
There are no pending studies at the time of discharge. The
patient will follow up with the CHF nurse in approximately 2 days
and see Dr. Weyhrauch in clinic within 1 week.

of 1.3 , normal liver function tests. His
hematocrit was slighlty low at 38.8 with a slight high MCV of 95.3 ,
and a high MCH of 32.9. His cholesterol was 267 , triglycerides
296. The PT was 11.6 , and the PTT was 31.4. The urinalysis was
benign. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 43 , and a
negative 30 degree axis , intervals .18/.08/.42 , and he had Q&apos;s in

cardiac catheterization on 10/5/90 .  He was found
to have normal RA pressures but lightly high RV pressure of 38/10 ,
wedge 12 , cardiac output 9.2 , and a cardiac index of 4.3. His SVR
was 878 , and the PVR was 104. He had an 80% proximal LAD lesion.
His other vessels were good. The next day , on 2/10/90 , he
underwent laser angioplasty of his LAD with good results , however ,
while the sheaths were in after the procedure , he developed left
arm tightness. Re-injection of his coronaries showed clot in the
LAD , and he underwent balloon angioplasty of the lesion with good
result. The patient experienced no more chest and no more arm
discomfort or jaw discomfort during this admission. The only
complication of the procedure was a left groin hematoma which was
stable , and he had a stable hematocrit as well. No bruits were
noted over his femoral arteries. The patient was noted to have an
anemia , a mild macrocytic anemia , on admission. Workup for this
concluded a normal ferritin , normal iron , normal TIBC , with a
saturation index of 22%. He had a normal B12 and a normal folate.
The thyroid functions were within normal limits. His reticulocyte
count was mildly decreased at 0.4.
COMPLICATIONS: There were no significant complications ono this
patient&apos;s admission.

showed a 40% ejection fraction with aortic stenosis , a peak
gradient of 35 and a calculated valve area of 1 cm squared.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
August , 2002 for an aortic valve replacement
with a St. Jude #23 mechanical valve and a coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 to the LAD , obtuse marginal and LVB1. The patient
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for close monitoring. However , the patient did develop
an uncontrolled left-sided nose bleed in the operating room and ENT
was called to pack the nose. The postoperative course was
remarkable for sluggish urine output for which Renal consult was
called in to follow. The patient was treated with diuretics and
her urine output subsequently improved. The patient was kept on
pressors and mechanical ventilation for several days and was then
extubated on January , 2002 after her volume overload was
controlled. The patient was transferred to the floor on July ,
2002 off her torsemide drip and tolerating intravenous intermittent
doses of torsemide. Otolaryngology removed the packing from the
patient&apos;s nose and she just had minor oozing after this not
requiring any treatment. Both Cardiology and Renal continued to
follow throughout the patient&apos;s hospital course and by May ,
2002 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet , urinating well
with oral antidiuretics and without subsequent nose bleeds. It was
decided that the patient was ready to be discharged to
rehabilitation at this point.

hyperkalemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly this is a 60-year-old
gentleman with COPD on 3 liters home O2 and a history of multiple
past intubations to his noncompliant with his home oxygen therapy
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 2 , coronary artery disease status post end-stomy ,
diastolic heart failure who presented to the Emergency Department
with shortness of breath , chest tightness and wheezing times
several days. He also complained of a productive cough and was
found to have a room air oxygen saturation of 82% that improved
to the mid 90s on nonrebreather. He was admitted to the ICU
where he was started on BiPAP and given prednisone and nebulizer
treatments. Chest x-ray identified a right middle lobe
infiltrate and the patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin
and ceftazidime. Ceftazidime was later discontinued. He was
quickly weaned to 5 liters nasal cannula. An ABG checked on
admission showed partial CO2 of 60 which is the patient&apos;s
baseline. He was also found to be on acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 4.9 that improved with gentle fluids. Potassium
was elevated at 6.4 and the patient did undergo a single run of
hemodialysis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , coronary artery disease status post
end-stomy , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia
and gout.

IMPRESSION: This is a 60-year-old gentleman admitted for a COPD
exacerbation in the setting of likely pneumonia with acute on
chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia that has resolved since
his admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary: The patient was kept on prednisone 60 mg p.o.
daily for the first several days of his floor admission and he
was continued on DuoNeb q.6 h. , albuterol labs were added q.6 h.
staggered with DuoNeb such that he was receiving nebulizer
treatments every three hours. He was continued on chest PT. The
patient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructive
sleep apnea. He had not been compliant with CPAP as an
outpatient. Advair was continued. The patient did well with
this regimen and his oxygen requirements were titrated from 5
liters to 2.5 liters at the time of discharge. At this level of
oxygen he was satting in the low to mid 90s with ambulatory sat
of approximately 90%. The importance of continuing use of home
oxygen both during the day and at night was discussed at length
with the patient , though he continued to complain that he had
difficulty going about his daily activities wearing his oxygen. Prednisone
was slowly tapered and at the time of discharge the patient was
taking 40 mg of prednisone per day. He will take 20 mg starting
the first day after his discharge and will complete a slow
approximately 2-week taper. His home dose of Lasix was
continued. The patient was not felt to be clinically volume
overloaded. However , he auto-diuresed 1-2 liters the majority
of the days he was admitted to the floor. Followup was arranged
with the patient&apos;s primary care provider and his pulmonologist
Dr. Gering . The possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
was discussed at length with the patient and his wife who were
extremely resistant to any other inpatient care. He is therefore
discharged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup.
2. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine trended down throughout his
time on the floor. This happened in the setting of continued
auto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was due
to a low flow state as result of heart failure rather than
hypovolemia. At the time of discharge his creatinine was 1.3.
He was followed by the Renal Team during his admission. His ARB
was initially held but then restarted upon improvement of his
creatinine. Per renal , his elevated BUN in the range of 200 was
felt to be secondary to steroid use. This had normalized by the
time of discharge. The patient was worked up for a possible AV
fistula or graft placement in the left upper extremity in the
near future. He will follow up with vascular surgery as an
outpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. He should not receive blood
draws in the left upper extremity of avoidable.
3. Infectious disease: The patient was continued on vancomycin
and Levaquin for a seven-day course. He completed this course
during this hospitalization and he discharged off antibiotics.
All cultures were no growth at the time of discharge.
4. Cardiovascular: He was continued on aspirin and
anti-lipidemics. His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension and
he is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of his
antihypertensive medicines have not changed. He was kept on tele
during his admission and did have occasional episodes of NSVT
usually triplets or couplets. These were asymptomatic.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Vitro insulin requirements increased
dramatically during his ICU admission , likely as a result of
steroid use and stress. His insulin requirements fell to their
preadmission levels during his admission on the floor.
6. Prophylaxis: He was maintained on heparin and proton pump
inhibitor.
CODE STATUS: The patient is full code.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: He is in no apparent distress.
Heart , regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft , obese , nontender , bowel
sounds are present. He has trace peripheral edema bilaterally.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please see remainder of discharge
paperwork.
DISPOSITION: To home with VNA. He should follow up with both
his primary care doctor and pulmonologist. These appointments
have been arranged for him.

transferred from an outside hospital for treatment of her
symptomatic mitral valve stenosis. For the past two years , Ms.
Va had experienced a steady very gradual decline in her
exercise tolerance with a decreased ability to make her bed or
vacuum. However , she noticed this only in retrospect. On
6/4/97 , she presented to an outside hospital complaining of the
abrupt onset over one day of weakness , shortness of breath , 1/10
chest pain radiating to bilateral elbows , and dizziness. Symptoms
occurred at rest and were not positional and there were no
relieving or aggravating signs. They lasted approximately nine
hours resolving in the Emergency Department at the outside hospital
before therapy was initiated. Chest x-ray at this time showed mild
congestive heart failure which responded to Lasix 20 mg intravenous
push in the Emergency Department. She was admitted , ruled out for
a myocardial infarction with CK of 31 , 67 , 64 , and 59 , and sent to
catheterization on 3/8/97 which showed a left ostia at 30% , 25 mm
mitral valve gradient , pulmonary artery pressure of 8 , wedge of 18 ,
and cardiac output of 5.3. Echo revealed right and left atrial
enlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , ejection fraction was 60% to 65% , and mitral
stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm squared down from 1.2
cm squared in 6/10 .  Ms. Sakovitch remained at this outside hospital
for one week essentially symptom free on bedrest and medical
management while awaiting transfer for definitive treatment at the
Ni Rise University Hospitals Of .  She was transferred to the Theay Hospital on the evening of 6/25/97 in good condition
and remained symptom free on bedrest. She complained of no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , hemoptysis , fever , chills ,
nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or change in bowel or bladder habits.

1. Ventral hernia containing nonobstructive transverse colon.
2. Nonspecific low-attenuation segment VII hepatic lesion
3. Oral contrast remains in the stomach.
KUB postcontrast: Oral contrast from the CT abdomen and pelvis
remains in the stomach suggesting possibility of gastric atony

KUB post-EGD: No free air or obstruction.
Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , right
bundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in the
emergency department as well as consultations from the
gastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient was
thought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis given
the findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasound
and KUB. The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his
diabetes. He was admitted to the medical service and his diet
was slowly increased. On the floor , his pain continued , and
within two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.
He had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distended
gallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive
stranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acute
acalculous cholecystitis. Surgery was reconsulted , and the
patient was taken to the operating room where he had an
exploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open
cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. The patient
received perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl and
continued to do well post surgery with advancement of his diet
and decrease in his pain medication requirement. Vancomycin was
discontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. He was
continued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. He had a drain that was
left in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .
Following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage of
green-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. An abdominal
CT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.
An ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.
They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further
leak. The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagyl
following the procedure. His diet was advanced and he tolerated
this well. He had no further pain. He is being discharged on a
total of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bile
leak.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin while
he was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.
Cardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiac
transplant team. He was initially switched to IV cyclosporine
and his CellCept was held. These were transitioned to p.o. and
restarted following his improvement. Postoperatively , he got
stress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this was
then tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at his
home dose. He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. He
got 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted on
his torsemide to maintain euvolemia. His Cartia was initially
discontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but
this was then restarted. He was discharged on all his home
medications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.
Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral
elbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.
The rheumatology service was consulted. A left elbow tap was
attempted , but this did not return any fluid. He was given
several doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. The steroid
taper was slowed and his gout improved. He was discharged
without any elbow pain.
Phlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to an
infiltrating IV. This was covered by his antibiotics that were
started for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.
FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The patient will follow up with the cardiac transplant
service. This will be arranged by them.
2. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Magdefrau from
general surgery ( 800-336-8213 ) to have his staples removed in two
weeks.
3. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Vinion from
gastroenterology to schedule an appointment to have his stents
removed in six weeks.
4. The patient will continue to take his cardiac medications as
before. His torsemide is dosed now at 40 mg q.a.m.
5. The patient will continue on Levaquin and Flagyl as
prescribed for five days following discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg daily.
2. Caltrate 600 plus D 1500 mg daily.
3. Colchicine 0.3 mg orally daily as needed for gout.
4. Neoral 150 mg twice a day.
5. Cartia XT 300 mg daily.
6. Nexium 40 mg daily.
7. Folate 1 mg daily.
8. NovoLog sliding scale.

Discharge Date: 8/5/2007
ATTENDING: TALSKY , JARVIS CLAIR M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Diabetes.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: Cirrhosis and IPF.
SERVICES: GMS Chi
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old female
with a history of IPF , on home oxygen at 3 l nasal cannula at
baseline , cryptogenic cirrhosis , and insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus who was recently admitted from 9/10/07 through 4/28/07
for hyperglycemia and volume overload , who presented with
hyperglycemia and weight gain. Of note , during the patient&apos;s
previous admission , she was diagnosed with a urinary tract
infection as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis based on a
diagnostic paracentesis , which showed greater than 250
neutrophils. During that admission , the patient was treated for
a urinary tract infection and the SBP and was sent home on a
course of oral cefpodoxime. Of note , during that previous
admission , the patient was also hyperglycemic and was discharged
on an insulin regimen of Lantus 90 with good aspartate sliding
scale. At home , the patient&apos;s blood pressures were in the 200 to
300s and at times even higher. Over the week prior to admission ,
it was noted that the patient gained somewhere from about 8 to 10
pounds with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.
As noted above , the patient&apos;s fingersticks were noted to be
elevated in the 300s and so her Lantus was titrated from 90 units
daily to 100 units by the visiting nurse. The patient was
previously discharged on Lasix 40 mg twice daily , which was
titrated up to 80 mg twice daily also by the visiting nurse and
her primary care physician. The patient had no additional
shortness of breath , and her oxygen sat was unchanged on her home
dose of O2. She had no chest pain , no cough , and no fevers. No
nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. The patient had finished a 7-day
course of cefpodoxime on the day of admission. The patient&apos;s
mental status was unchanged as felt by the daughter.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , on 3 L home O2.
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
3. Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and esophageal
varices as well as possible hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Hypertension.
5. Status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Fosamax 35 mg p.o. weekly.
2. Caltrate 600 mg plus D 1 tabler daily.
3. Cefpodoxime 200 mg daily , which was completed the day prior
to admission.
4. Clotrimazole troche orally four times daily.
5. Dexamethasone 1 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Lantus 100 units subcutaneously every morning.
8. Combivent 2 puffs inhaled 4 times daily.
9. Lisinopril 20 mg daily.
10. Nadolol 10 mg p.o. daily.
11. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.
11. Bactrim DS 1 tablet p.o. daily.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her daughter , Lescano , who
is her healthcare proxy and can be reached at 976-115-0167. The
patient has never drunk alcohol , smoked , and never used any
illicit drugs. The patient is originally from Clear A Rieholl and
Spanish-speaking.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. Temperature was 96.9 ,
heart rate was 62 , and blood pressure was 90/50. She was
breathing 16 times and was saturating 99% on her home baseline
dose of oxygen at 3 L.
HEENT: Notable for tongue that showed thrush.
NECK: JVP was difficult to asses but thought to be slightly
elevated. There was no lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS: Dry inspiratory crackles at both bases.
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has slow heart rate with normal S1
and S2. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Slightly distended , soft , and nontender with no
guarding and positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES: Remarkable for 3+ edema , pitted , to the knees.
NEUROLOGIC: No asterixis and no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Electrolytes were remarkable for
BUN and creatinine of 65/1.6 as well as a potassium of 6.0.
Albumin was noted to be 2.6. CBC showed a white count of 8.51 ,
hematocrit of 34.7 , and platelets of 92 with less than 5% bands.
STUDIES: EKG reveals sinus bradycardia at 50 beats per minute
with normal axis and normal intervals and nonspecific ST
abnormalities , unchanged from prior EKGs. A chest x-ray showed
unchanged coarse bilateral opacities with no acute process.
IMPRESSION: The patient is a 76-year-old female with history of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis
complicated by ascites and esophageal varices , who was admitted
with hyperglycemia and volume overload.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with hyperglycemia and
sugar in the 600s. The patient was initially started on insulin
drip at 4 units per hour , and her sugars quickly normalized. The
patient was transitioned over to subcutaneous insulin regimen
that included Lantus and q.a.c. aspartate as well as sliding
scale. The patient&apos;s fingersticks remained labile throughout
this admission and at times were elevated in the 300s and other
times were normal in the range of 70 to 90. The patient&apos;s
insulin was titrated , and she was discharged on a regimen that
included Lantus 90 units subcutaneously daily as well as
aspartate 28 units subcutaneously before each meal. It was
noticed that the patient had the most difficulty with
postprandial sugars often after lunch and dinner. Therefore , we
recommended that if she continues to have hyperglycemia , that it
would be best to titrate the q.a.c. aspartate. It would be best
to avoid titrating the Lantus too much given that her fasting
sugar in the morning was often normal. The patient had no
hypoglycemic episodes during this admission. Of note , the
patient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home;
however , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thought
that this would not likely be the best regimen for her. This was
discussed with the patient&apos;s family and caregivers who were
amenable to this idea , however , will likely need further
teaching.
2. GI: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis
complicated by ascites and esophageal varices. The patient was
thought to be grossly volume overloaded due to her cirrhosis and
hypoalbuminemia on admission. The patient was initially diuresed
with IV Lasix with good results. The patient did have a bump in
her creatinine due to this aggressive diuresis and her Lasix was
held for several days , but her oral Lasix was restarted prior to
discharge. The patient was discharged on 60 mg of p.o. Lasix
twice daily. The patient on admission was thought to have
significant amount of ascites based on abdominal exam. The
patient had recently completed a course of treatment for
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tenderness
but did have distention. An abdominal ultrasound was obtained as
a diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patient
had an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasound
revealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable to
paracentesis. The patient has a history of esophageal varices
and was continued on her nadolol for prophylaxis. The patient
was continued on her Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis. The patient
did have an episode of confusion and delirium during this
admission , which was felt to be likely due to hepatic
encephalopathy. The patient&apos;s delirium improved with the
initiation of lactulose. The patient was discharged on lactulose
30 mL q.i.d. , which we titrated so that the patient has at least
3 bowel movements daily. At the time of discharge , the patient
was alert and oriented. Of note , the patient was not started on
Aldactone for management of her volume overload given that she
was admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevated
potassium.
3. Neurologic: The patient had had one episode of delirium
during this admission where she was confused , did not know where
she was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately.
The patient had a workup at that time , which included an
infectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. The
patient was started on lactulose , which had to be an administered
initially by retention enema as she was refusing to take p.o.
The patient&apos;s mental status improved within 24 hours of starting
the lactulose , and she was continued on this regimen and will be
discharged on it. Of note , the patient had no asterixis on
discharge.
4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease
with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7. The patient was
admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 , which did increase slightly
with increased diuresis. The patient&apos;s Lasix was held for a day
or two and then she was restarted on her oral home Lasix regimen ,
which was titrated to 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Of note , the patient&apos;s
lisinopril was held on admission due to hyperkalemia. The
lisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given the
patient&apos;s history of hyperkalemia and several episodes during
this admission , which required the administration of Kayexalate.
The patient likely should be on an ACE inhibitor for chronic
kidney disease , but this can be re-added as an outpatient with
very close monitoring of her potassium as this was felt to be
indicated by the patient&apos;s primary care physician. Of note , the
patient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission.
5. Pulmonary: The patient has history of IPF and had no acute
pulmonary issues during this admission. The patient was
saturating well on her home dose of O2 throughout the entire
admission. The patient was continued on her home dose of
dexamethasone for IPF.
6. Infectious Disease: Prior to discharge , the patient was
incidentally noted to have a urine culture that was growing
greater than 100 , 000 colonies. The patient was afebrile and had
no symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white count
of 11 , 000. Based on the patient&apos;s recent UTI , she was started on
cefpodoxime for a short 5-day course. Results of this urine
culture will need to be followed up and her antibiotics adjusted
as necessary. The patient was continued on her Bactrim for both
SPEP and PCP prophylaxis.
CODE STATUS: The patient was full code throughout this entire admission.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: The patient home was

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEART FAILURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.
2. VALVULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY.
3. MITRAL REGURGITATION.
4. TRICUSPID REGURGITATION.
5. HYPERTENSION.
6. HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.
7. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old man with
valvular cardiomyopathy , status post
three aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acute
complaints but a progressive decline in daily function.
Mr. Kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented with
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the
setting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension )
noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aortic
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular
hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently
underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve
repair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.
One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacement
with dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with
cultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated with
amphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he also
required coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. This
hospital course was additionally complicated by development of
third degree heart block necessitating the implantation of a
permanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Buzo did generally
well for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presented
with increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate
to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this
time , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude&apos;s valve.
Again , following discharge , Mr. Kock did generally well until
4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that
time , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation
with left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,
along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and
an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showed
a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was
done at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from
40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding this
admission , Mr. Bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and is
here in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,
or if that doesn&apos;t work as it hasn&apos;t the last three times , to give
him a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea ,
fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on three
pillows at night and has not recently been short of breath when
lying flat. He is able to do chores around the house without
getting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath after
one flight of stairs. He doesn&apos;t complain of significant
disability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heart
condition. He notes that he has not been able to participate in
the marching band over the last year , but that he can play sitting
down. Mr. Lonn attributes his disease to having been
noncompliant with his Procardia following the cerebrovascular
accident in 1993. He says that , &quot;He brought on his heart problems
himself.&quot;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise , notable for an embolism to his
left foot in 1998 as a result of having
stopped Coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency with
creatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 2/12 , and he is status post
exploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Zestril , which gives him perioral
angioedema.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Avapro
150 mg q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg
b.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for heart disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quit
one year ago. He has occasional alcohol use.
Mr. Allegrini is on permanent disability leave from his job at
Des Jack Oxall , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. He lives at home
with his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his day
there. He is active in Naomin Me Yonkers , where he likes to play the base
drum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a thin , healthy-appearing
black man in no apparent distress. VITAL
SIGNS: Heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%
on room air. NECK: His carotid pulses variance and normal in
volume. Jugular venous pressure 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear. His PMI is
vibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterior
axillary line. He has a normal S1 , an ejection sound , and a loud
prosthetic S2 , a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border , and a III/IV holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border radiating to the right upper sternal border. ABDOMEN:
Non-distended , with no organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm with faint
pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit
33.5 , with a MCV of 83.5 , RDW of 28.8 ,
reticulocyte count of 6.6 and LDH of 1077. Mr. Shadler had an echo
here that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severely
dilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolic
diameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Exercise testing
showed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. On cath , his pulmonary artery
pressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was
47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectively
with Nipride. His systemic vascular resistance was markedly
elevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were
3.62 and 2.31. Amlodipine was then started and Lasix was increased
in an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance and
pulmonary wedge pressure. The remainder of the transplant workup
results were unremarkable except for a significantly reduced
diffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4
and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. Prostate biopsy and bone
scan were both negative. His admission was otherwise notable for
an elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperative
levofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilator
therapy. He was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low
2&apos;s before discharge.
Mr. Krough was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.d. ,
Avapro 150 mg q.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d. , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: He will follow-up with Dr. Lon Poat in
two weeks.

Discharge Date: 7/6/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Coronary artery bypass graft x3 , 3/4/97 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Hannen is a 72-year-old female
with no coronary artery disease who
was transferred from an outside hospital with unstable angina , to
the Cardiology Service. Her risk factors include positive family
history , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. Her cardiac
history included a myocardial infarction in 1983 , followed by
post-infarct sustained in 1989 , which was treated medically. She
had a preop evaluation prior to bladder surgery , at which time , an
ETT was positive and cardiac cath revealed 70% proximal LAD , 70%
mid LAD , 70% distal LAD , 50% proximal circumflex , total occlusion
of obtuse marginal I , an 80% occlusion obtuse marginal II
occlusion. She was managed medically without any further symptoms
until 11/27 when she developed chest pain on exertion , which was
again treated medically. On 2/9/97 , she was admitted to Ton Valley Hospital And Medical Center for elective bladder suspension which was attempted
laparoscopically but complicated by bladder rupture and was
converted to an open procedure. Intraoperatively , she was noted to
have ST changes. She was taken to the ICU where she ruled out for
a myocardial infarction. However , subsequently , she developed
chest pain and shortness of breath , with ST depression. She was
therefore transferred to the Nin Vensca Memorial for cardiac
catheterization and possible coronary revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , coronary
artery disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bladder suspension in 1995 and 1997.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d.; atenolol 30 mg p.o.
q.d.; Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Premarin 0.625 mg p.o.
q.d.; Bactrim DS 1 tab p.o. b.i.d.; Dilatrate 40 mg t.i.d.;
Compazine 10 mg p.r.n. q.8h.; Darvocet 100 mg p.r.n. q.4h.; heparin
subcu.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS - Afebrile , pulse 77 , regular , BP
120/60 , two liters saturating 97%. SKIN - No jaundice , no anemia.
No clubbing , cyanosis , or pedal edema. NECK - Soft right carotid
bruit. LUNGS - Clear to auscultation. HEART - Normal heart
sounds , II/VI systolic murmur at left sternal border. ABDOMEN -
Soft , non-tender , non-distended. Surgical incision healing well.
EXTREMITIES - No varicose veins , bilateral dorsalis pedis , 2+
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 133 , K 3.1 , Cl 100 , CO2 30 , BUN 4 , creatinine
0.6 , glucose 106. White count 10.9 , hematocrit
27.4 , platelets 211. EKG normal sinus rhythm , with Q-waves in aVF.
Chest x-ray shows no active infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was taken to the Cath Lab and underwent a
cardiac catheterization on 1/10/97 .  This
revealed an occluded right coronary artery , 70% left circumflex
stenosis , a totally occlused obtuse marginal , 70-80% LAD stenosis ,
serial 70% stenosis in diagonal I , left ventricular ejection
fraction of 50% , and inferior akinesis.
She was taken to the Operating Room on 3/19/97 and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft x3 , LIMA to LAD , saphenous vein graft
to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal.
Postoperatively , he remained in the ICU for three days postop
because of rapid atrial fibrillation which required increasing
amounts of beta blocker therapy. She was transferred out of the
unit on postop day #4. She underwent a cystogram on 4/17/97 which
did not show any evidence of a leak. She continued to remain in
atrial fibrillation intermittently , which responded to increasing
dose of Lopressor and lateral conversion of Lopressor to atenolol
100 mg b.i.d. She continued to develop atrial fibrillation every
morning in spite of increasing doses of atenolol. Therefore ,
procainamide was started on 5/28/97 and she is being discharged on
1/4/97 after having remained in sinus rhythm for 24 hours on
atenolol 100 mg b.i.d. and Procan SR 500 mg q.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Percocet 1-2
tabs p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain; Coumadin dose
to be based on INR range of 2-2.5; Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
cephradine 500 mg q.i.d. x7 days for redness at saphenous vein
graft harvest site above the medial malleolus; Procan SR 750 mg
p.o. q.i.d.
DISCHARGE DIET: No diet restrictions.
DISCHARGE ACTIVITY: As tolerated.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: Arrangements have been made for follow-up
with Dr. Friedeck and Cardiology in one week ,
and Dr. Barcus in 4-6 weeks.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: To home , with services.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old , white male
with insulin dependent , adult onset
diabetes mellitus , past alcohol abuse , cardiomyopathy , congestive
heart failure , and seizure disorder , who has been relatively
disabled due to shortness of breath , since 1992. The patient was
at home on the day of admission when he noted difficulty lighting a
cigarette with his right hand , as well as keeping it in his mouth.
The patient had difficulty speaking and his arm became
progressively weaker over the next several hours. The patient was
able to eat and drink with some difficulty. He noted word finding
difficulty , dysarthria , and arm weakness. The patient denied
headache , visual problems , loss of sensation , loss of
consciousness , urinary symptoms , diplopia , vertigo , nausea ,
vomiting , or difficulty ambulating. The patient was brought to the
Emergency Room by his son when his symptoms continued to worsen.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for
alcoholism , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart
failure , coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by focal motor
seizures with hyperglycemia , deep venous thrombosis , venostasis
ulcers , cellulitis , diabetic retinopathy , idiopathic eosinophilia ,
asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , gout ,
hepatosplenomegaly , and ascites.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications on admission include
hydroxyurea 500 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , insulin
NPH 30 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
p.r.n. gout , and Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: His social history is notable for occasional
alcohol use. Of note , his last use of alcohol was
one week prior to admission. The patient had previously used
alcohol quite seriously , with one case of beer q day times 33
years , quitting heavy alcohol use after his myocardial infarction.
The patient smokes tobacco one pack per day. He used cocaine for
three years but quit cocaine use three years prior to admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is notable for very poor
exercise tolerance with a one block maximum
limit. The patient stops due to shortness of breath and
claudication. He also has two pillow orthopnea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant , obese , middle aged ,
53 year old , white male with a right facial
droop and in no acute distress. Temperature is 97 , pulse 84 , blood
pressure 126/70 , and O2 saturation is 99 percent on room air. His
heent examination was notable for no nystagmus and no diplopia.
His tongue was deviated to the right. His neck was supple with a
full range of motion. He had no bruits or lymphadenopathy. His
cardiac examination revealed tachycardia , regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 and S2 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard loudest at the
axilla. His lung examination showed fine crackles at the left base
with diffuse wheezes. His abdomen was obese , soft , distended , and
non-tender. He had normoactive bowel sounds and liver span of 15
cm. His extremity examination was notable for chronic venostasis
changes , right greater than left , with 1+ peripheral pulses. His
neurological examination was notable for his being alert and
oriented times three. His ability to name was intact but he had
word finding difficulty. He had no right and left confusion. He
had downward droop of his right nasolabial fold , as well as a right
oral droop and a central seventh deficit. His tongue showed right
deviation. His sensory ability was intact overall. He had
decreased motor tone in his right upper extremity with 4/5 strength
in his right arm. His right arm lacked coordination and he had
difficulty initiating movement with his right arm but his strength
was still 4/5. His left upper extremity was 5/5 strength with good
coordination. His lower extremities were both 5/5.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 140 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 19 , BUN 44 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose was 164. White count was 11 , 000 , hematocrit 43.3 , and
platelet count was 163 , 000. PT was 14.1 , INR 1.4 , PTT 29.1.
Urinalysis showed 20 to 25 hyaline casts with 3-5 red blood cells.
There were no white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service
with a presumptive diagnosis of a left sided
stroke. A head CT was performed on hospital day number one but was
negative with no evidence of cerebral infarct or bleeding.
However , a follow up head CT on hospital day number three
demonstrated acute infarct in the left insular capsule and left
corona radiata. A carotid ultrasound was obtained on hospital day
number five which demonstrated bilateral carotid plaques with less
than 50 percent stenosis of both carotid arteries. Because of the
patient&apos;s history of diabetes and his cardiac history , especially
given his prior myocardial infarction , the patient was placed on a
ROMI protocol. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and he was given a cardiac echocardiogram on hospital day number
two. The echocardiogram demonstrated increased left ventricular
size with preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of
65 percent. He had dilated left and right atria and he had
thickened mitral valve leaflets with 4+ mitral regurgitation , with
flow reversible into his pulmonary veins. He also had 3 to 4+
tricuspid regurgitation with slow reversal into the vena cava. He
had a trileaflet aortic valve with mild sclerosis but no
insufficiency or stenosis. He also had increased right heart size
with right heart pressures of 55 to 60 mm of mercury. He was noted
to have a trivial pericardial effusion. Of note , there was no
evidence of any thrombus in the heart. However , because of the
nature of his stroke , which was felt to be embolic by neurology , as
well as his enlarged atria. The patient was placed on IV Heparin
and he was then started on oral Coumadin for long-term
anticoagulation. The patient did very well after his stroke and
his original slurred speech improved markedly over the course of
his admission. He also regained full strength in his right arm ,
although he continued to have some decreased coordination in that
arm. The patient also demonstrated inability to swallow without
difficulty and an esophagogram with video analysis was performed on
hospital day number six , prior to his discharge. The video study
of his swallowing demonstrated that he had essentially normal
swallowing and he was cleared to go home on a regular diet. Of
note , his blood pressure tended to be low , around 100 to 110
systolic , while in the hospital , so his Lisinopril was discontinued
and he was given instructions that Lisinopril would be restarted by
his CMC attending after his discharge. His hydroxyurea was
increased from 500 mg to 1 gram q day. The patient did quite well
after his stroke and he was discharged home with services on
April , 1995.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: His discharge medications were
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg p.o. q day , insulin NPH 30 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and 20
units subcutaneous q.p.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
wheezing , multivitamins one capsule p.o. q day , Coumadin 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. gout pain.
DISPOSITION: DIET: The patient is on an ADA 1800 calorie diet.
ACTIVITY: He has no activity restrictions.

Discharge Date: 2/15/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: RECURRENT ENDOCARDITIS AND END-STAGE CARDIAC
VALVULAR DISEASE.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Mitral valve replacement on 2 of November and
cardiac transplantation on 18 of September .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The history of present illness is that
of a 55-year-old female with a history
of rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis , who presented to the
Side Lygreen Medical Center on 3 of August to the Cardiology Service with progressive
weight gain , lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The
patient had a history of rheumatic fever as a child , and she
presented in 1985 with mitral and aortic valvular endocarditis
following a root canal. She subsequently underwent aortic and
mitral valve replacement secondary to her aortic and mitral
insufficiency. Her perioperative course was complicated by a brain
abscess which was without neurologic residual deficit. In 1989 the
patient again presented with recurrent endocarditis and underwent a
repeat mitral valve and aortic valve replacement. For the past year
prior to presentation , she has had increasing symptoms of right
heart failure including lower extremity edema and ascites which did
not improve with medical treatment. She has also presented with
complaints of shortness of breath. In February of 1993 she underwent
a transesophageal echo which revealed a perivalvular leak for which
she underwent her third mitral valve replacement. Tricuspid
annuloplasty was performed at that time. The patient has never
significantly improved past her most recent surgery and her most
recent transesophageal echo performed in Ta Ca Elponcevo three
weeks prior to presentation demonstrated again a perivalvular
mitral leak. The patient has had a significant lower extremity
edema with a weight gain of 30 pounds since her discharge one month
ago. She has no shortness of breath at rest but does have
significant dyspnea on exertion with minimal effort. She denies
fever or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is as stated above. She
also has some chronic renal insufficiency
with baseline BUN and creatinine of 40 and 2.0. She is status post
cholecystectomy in 1990.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on presentation to the Paa Talc Rton Health were
Lasix 100 mg b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg every other day ,
Coumadin 5 mg alternating with 2.5 mg every day , and Captopril 12.5
mg three times a day. She is allergic to penicillin and codeine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable for
a tired appearing female with a cardiac exam
notable for mechanical valvular heart sounds and 4+ pitting lower
extremity edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Her admission BUN and creatinine were 61 and 1.9.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted to the Cardiology Service and
was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service , and
it was felt that mitral valve repair and/or replacement would be
beneficial to the patient. She , therefore , underwent mitral valve
repair on 2 of November but was without significant symptoms for her
right heart failure , and was placed on the cardiac transplant list.
She underwent successful cardiac transplantation on 18 of September .  Since
that time , her main issues have centered over management of her
residual ascites with diuresis of her third spaced volume.
Additionally she had had some nose bleeds preoperatively which were
felt to be related to nasal polyps for which she was seen by the
ENT Service. She underwent routine post transplant biopsies and
echocardiograms , all of which showed adequate acceptance of organs
and good LV function. She continued to do quite well with the
exception of some dysphagia early in her postoperative course which
was found to be possibly secondary to some esophageal ulcerations ,
but these have subsequently resolved and she is tolerating a
regular diet. She was noted two days prior to transfer to the
Norri Verlan Medical Center to have some diffuse mild
abdominal pain , and KUB and upright revealed large amounts of
stool , and she felt great relief from soap suds enemas. She has
been stable on her medications with adequate cyclosporine levels.
Imuran was recently held secondary to neutropenia.
DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the Holls Health on approximately the third
postoperative week from her cardiac transplant.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications include Mylicon 80
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Trental 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Nystatin cream topically once per day , Mycostatin powder topically
once per day , terbutaline 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nystatin swish and
swallow 10 cc p.o. t.i.d. , magnesium oxide 280 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
human regular insulin 4 units subcu q a.m. and before dinner and
NPH insulin 28 units subcu q a.m. , omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q a.m. ,
cyclosporine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. plus levels checked daily ,
potassium 40 mEq q a.m. , prednisone 27.5 mg p.o. q a.m. , Lasix 40
mg p.o. q a.m. , Percocet as needed for pain and Serax 10 mg as
needed at night for sleep.
FOLLOW UP: She will follow up with the Cardiac Transplantation
Service. She is referred to Rush-coo Chry&apos;s Calctist Medical Center for physical therapy rehabilitation as well as medications
management and assistance. She is discharged to U Hospital on 8 of April .

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple
myeloma , and worsening BPH ( benign prostatic hypertrophy ) ,
requiring a Foley. The patient was seen in Randuke Hospital on the day of admission and was noted to have a
hematocrit drop from the 37 range to 28.5 along with hypotension
and an increasing creatinine rising from 1.2-2.3 in one week&apos;s
time.
The patient was noted to have recently significantly increasing
lower extremity edema. He reports that over a 3-4 day period , he
went from having almost no edema to having very large legs , which
he describes &quot;tree trunks.&quot; The patient reports that these were
painful at first , but are no longer painful. He reports that
they were always symmetric. The patient reports no prior history
of CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiac
problems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attack
at 27 years old. The patient did not know the details of these
cardiac events at 27 years old , and has received minimal followup
for this issue. He does report that he was intermittently seen
by a cardiologist , and had a normal catheterization four years
ago. He reports he has never had an echocardiogram.
The patient also reports an episode of 30-minute chest tightness
the day prior to admission while he was having a Foley catheter
placed. The patient did not tell anyone about this at that time ,
and this pain desisted on its own. The pain was described as
substernal burning pain , with no left arm pain , no jaw pain , no
shortness of breath or diaphoresis , and no nausea or vomiting.
The patient has had no orthopnea or PND.
The patient has had a recent history increasingly worsening BPH.
The patient has a 15-year history of BPH , and is followed by Dr.
Tod Cutshall at Kernmilf Nadrock Hospital And Health Center .  The patient was
recently admitted to SHHC for anuria , had a cystoscopy , clot
evacuation and was discharged on 7/24/05 with a Foley in place.
The patient followed up with Dr. Queen on 10/21/05 , had his
Foley removed , but failed this trial and he represented to an
outside hospital with clots and anuria. The patient&apos;s bladder
was irrigated and the Foley was replaced. He reports that he has
been passing clots but that he has been passing urine. The
patient also reports that his urine while having clots at times ,
is mostly clear and yellow , and that he continually makes urine
and has to replace the Foley bag.

Achilles tendons are equal bilaterally. Sensation grossly intact
on upper and lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY RESULTS:
On admission , the patient&apos;s white blood cell count was 7.2 , his
hematocrit was 28.5 , down from 37 one week previously. The
patient&apos;s platelet count was 238 , 000. The patient&apos;s chem-7 was
unremarkable with the exception of a creatinine of 2.3 , up from a
baseline of 1.2-1.4 over one week&apos;s time. The patient had a BNP
checked , which turned out to be 312 , elevated. The patient has
also had several recent imaging studies including renal
ultrasound on 2/6/05 , which showed multiple bilateral renal
cysts but no obstruction. An abdominal MRI was obtained on
2/20/05 , which showed small amount of ascites , an enlarged
prostate , multiple renal cysts , no other pathologies was noted.
The patient also had a CT to evaluate his ureters on 10/8/05 ,
which showed no stones in the kidneys or ureters , but an enlarged
prostate.
A cystoscopy report from 9/23/05 from a recent admission to
Ma Faulkmark Hospital showed oozing from tortuous veins in
the prostate.
The patient had an EKG , which showed first-degree block with a
left bundle branch block , and frequent PVCs. This was noted to
be present on an old examination , after consultation with an
outpatient cardiologist at Perlaw Memorial Hospital .  The patient
had a troponin I of 0.11 , slightly elevated. The patient&apos;s CK
was 136 , MB fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. On
admission , the patient coagulation parameters showed an INR of
1.2. Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiac
catheterization at Beckry Hospital in 2001 , which showed no
obstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary artery
disease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. An adenosine MIBI
obtained in 2002 at Peacepe Planthugh Memorial Medical Center showed possible old
inferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of
35-40%. An echocardiogram obtained during this admission
demonstrated the patient&apos;s EF at this point to be 25% , rather
with global hypokinesis.
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES:
There were no operations or procedures performed during this
admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to be
likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , and
increased leg edema and a low blood pressure. Because the
patient was determined to be in CHF , he was diuresed with IV
Lasix , and later with p.o. Lasix , the patient was diuresed
approximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. The patient&apos;s
blood pressure subsequently rose. After consultation with
Cardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor should be added to the patient&apos;s medication regimen as
his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and
congestive heart failure.
Because the patient was initially determined to have some risk of
myocardial infarction , had reported chest pain the day prior to
admission , and had slightly elevated troponins. The patient&apos;s
troponin and CK-MB were followed until they began decreasing. It
is likely that these very small elevations were due to small
amount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient&apos;s fluid
overload and anemia. The patient was continued on his statin
medication.
The patient on admission had frequent PVCs , and some short runs
of ventricular tachycardia lasting less than 5 beats. After
diuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had only
minimal ectopy. The patient&apos;s electrolytes including potassium
and magnesium were checked daily and repleted as necessary.
Aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having a
benefit in cardiac disease of this kind. This is because the
patient&apos;s hematocrit was low and he had recently had bleeding
likely from his bladder. Urology Department was consulted
regarding this decision.
Renal/genitourinary: The patient has a long known history of BPH
and is followed closely at Cotson Tionlo Hospital by Dr.
Josue Grefe . The patient was recently admitted for these
problems due to obstruction , and instrumentation. On admission ,
the patient&apos;s urine did not have any red blood cells , and he had
no obvious clots at any point. After consultation with Urology ,
and after the patient had been diuresing well with Lasix , the
patient&apos;s Foley catheter was removed and after this point he had
no problem with urinating. The patient was maintained on Proscar
in addition to Flomax.
Heme: The patient&apos;s hematocrit drop was likely due to two
factors. First of all , the patient is known to have been losing
blood in the form of clots from his bladder. This is likely due
to bleeding from the surface of his prostate where a recent
cystoscopy had demonstrated tortuous veins. In addition , the
reading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission was likely secondary
to dilution , the patient was massively fluid overloaded. The
patient&apos;s hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained in
the 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. He was ,
however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse him
should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiac
history.
Oncologic: The patient is followed closely by Dr. Zecchini at
Hool Norhunt General Hospital .  His most recent treatment was on
8/4/05 and his multiple myeloma seems to be responding well to
therapy. During this admission , multiple myeloma was not an
active issue. See Reb Memorial Hospital notes for more information.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes , he
takes Lantus and Novolog at home. He was continued on these
medications while as an inpatient.
Pain: The patient was offered oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. He did
not complain of any pain during admission.
Psychiatric: The patient , though pleasant and cooperative on
admission , became increasingly combative. On the night of
1/5/05 , he became very combative , and attempted to hit one of
the cross covering physicians. The patient was initially tried
on several medications to control this agitation including Ativan
and Zyprexa. These apparently were not effective at first. The
patient continued to have difficulty sleeping and was very
agitated. At one point , he would not take his medications.
Psychiatry was involved , and after much discussion with the
patient and involvement of social work , the patient did calm down
and agreed to medical care. At one point when he became
agitated , he was given Haldol intravenously , in addition to
Ativan , after being given these medications , the patient slept
very well through the night. When he awoke the next morning , his
mood was much improved , and he apologized for his behavior ,
reporting he did not know what happened. Because of the change
in mental status , several studies were obtained to investigate
this , a head CT showed no acute disease , only some bony changes
likely chronic due to multiple myeloma. In addition , the
patient&apos;s electrolytes were checked which were normal , the
patient&apos;s fingerstick blood glucose was checked which was normal.
In addition , an RPR was sent , in addition to folate and B12.
These labs were pending at the time of discharge and will be
followed up by his outpatient physicians.

Discharge Date: 6/25/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
2 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3 ) HYPERTENSION.
4 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year-old woman
with a history of myocardial
infarction , atrial fibrillation , hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presents with shortness of breath.
The patient is status post inferior posterior myocardial infarction
on March , 1998. Thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severe
hypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ).
Catheterization revealed 80% RCA stenosis with thrombus. She
underwent PTCA and stenting and ReoPro under the Lakeni Ralton Rooson Hospital study.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , inferior
posterior lateral hypokinesis , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+
mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency. She was
treated with Ticlid for 30 days , aspirin , Lopressor , Verapamil and
Captopril. That hospital course was complicated by asymptomatic
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia and new
diagnosis of hyperthyroidism ( TSH less than assay , T4 16.1 , T3 133 ,
THBR 1.24 ). She was started on Procainamide and subsequently as an
outpatient on PTU without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. She
has been treated with Coumadin. On April , 1998 , she was admitted
for left upper extremity weakness with a question of transient
ischemic attack in the setting of subtherapeutic INR. Head CT scan
was negative and brain MRI/MRA was also negative. On September ,
1998 , she was admitted to Hillh Hospital for flash pulmonary
edema requiring intubation. She was in normal sinus rhythm , but
hypertensive. She ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeat
catheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. She was
subsequently started on Lasix and was well until the night prior to
admission when she developed gradually worsening shortness of
breath , wheezing and chest pain. Also , she had an increase in
orthopnea from one to two pillows , diaphoresis and worsening of her
baseline right shoulder pain with no edema. She had a cough
productive of scant white sputum for three days prior to admission ,
no fever or chills. In the emergency room , her blood pressure was
found to be 230/100 with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air
increasing to 95% on two liters. She had crackles one-third of the
way up her lung fields bilaterally. EKG was in normal sinus
rhythm. Chest x-ray showed edema and effusion. She improved
quickly with oxygen , nitrates and Lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
status post myocardial infarction in
October of 1998 , congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 45% , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , hyperthyroidism , bilateral retinal detachment , status
post left cataract surgery , status post appendectomy , status post
cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q. day. 5 )
Procainamide 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. day.
7 ) PTU 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8 ) Lasix 10 mg p.o. q. day. 9 )
Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She immigrated from the Pa Drive , Meroesun Geworth in
1981. She lives with her daughter and has a two
pack per day smoking history times 40 years. She has no alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she was breathing
comfortably , supine at 30 degrees. Vital
signs: Temperature 98.4 degrees , heart rate 61 and regular , blood
pressure 153/75 , respiratory rate 18 , with an oxygen saturation 93%
on three liters. HEENT examination revealed that the sclerae were
anicteric. Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx was benign. Neck
revealed that the jugular venous pressure was elevated to her ear.
Carotids were 1+ on the right , 2+ on the left. There was a
question of a right carotid bruit. There was no thyromegaly.
Lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an S4 ,
intermittent S3 , no murmurs. Abdomen revealed normal active bowel
sounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatile
liver. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. There
were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. There was no calf
tenderness. Skin was warm and dry. Neurological examination
revealed that cranial nerves III-XII were intact. Motor was five
out of five throughout. Sensory was intact to light touch
throughout. Reflexes were 2+ bilaterally with downgoing toes.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative in the emergency room.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory studies revealed a sodium of 140 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 0.6 , glucose 149. White blood cell count was 12.3 ,
hematocrit 38.8 , platelet count was normal. CK was 44. Troponin
was 0.03. INR was 1.8. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with
old inferior Qs , left ventricular hypertrophy with strain in I and
L which were old , T-wave inversion in III and V6 as well as
pseudonormalized T-waves in V1 through V4 which are new compared
with October , 1998. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonary
vascular redistribution , Kerley B lines , but no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment was
that the patient presented in acute congestive
heart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the
setting of hypertension. Other contributing factors possibly
playing a role in the patient&apos;s heart failure could have included
medication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. Another
possibility entertained was that the patient could have had
transient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however all
of her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning this
possibility. The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and
stabilized on p.o. Lasix during her hospital course.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs , Troponin and EKG.
2 ) Hyperthyroidism: The patient&apos;s TSA was measured to be at less
than assay on May , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolled
hyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiac
dysfunction. An Endocrine consult was obtained with the
recommendation that her PTU be increased to 100 mg t.i.d. Her T4
and THBR were measured and found to be 8.1 and 0.91 which were
within normal limits after the increased dose of PTU. The patient
is to receive follow-up in the Thyroid Clinic for definitive
therapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in her
left lobe.
3 ) Elevated white blood cell count on admission , but with a normal
differential: The patient remained afebrile throughout her
hospital course. Urinalysis was negative for infection and repeat
chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
4 ) Hypertension: The patient&apos;s blood pressure remained in the
range of 110-155/50-70s during her hospital course on Atenolol ,
Isordil and Lisinopril.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Lasix
80 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 ) Lisinopril
40 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Procainamide SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 7 ) PTU
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 8 ) Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q. day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with VNA services
to check weights and assistance with medication.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Pastor on February ,
1998 and Dr. Rais in the Thyroid Clinic on August ,

ATTENDING: OMAR SOMMESE M.D.
DISCHARGE DATE AND TIME:
The patient is being discharged from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit at 1:00 p.m. on the 2/17/2004 .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged to Ant University Hospital today.
ADMISSION DATE:
The patient was admitted to Trote Hospital on
2/4/2004 and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care unit on
6/29/2004 .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
The patient was admitted to Biand Valley General Hospital with the
diagnosis of changes in mental status secondary to hypercarbia.
The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for COPD , CHF , CAD , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , renal insufficiency , chronic venostasis , cellulitis ,
obesity , gout , sleep apnea , asthma , hypertension , urinary
retention , degenerative joint disease of the right knee. The
patient is status post CABG 1999 three vessels. The patient has
an 80-pack-year smoking history. The patient is on two liters of
nasal cannula at home. The patient is full code.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a long history of
COPD who is on 2 liters of nasal cannula at home with
80-pack-year of smoking history.
Briefly , the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admitted
to Astine Emount Wallca Medical Center on 2/4/2004 with drowsiness and
slurred speech. Initial ABG showed pH of 7.25 , PCO2 of 82 , PO2
of 56 , sating 87%. He quickly awakened after Narcan was
administered. Recently , he had been taking an increased amount
of opiates for pain and he was admitted with a diagnosis of
hypercarbia secondary to increased opiate intake and COPD flare.
The patient had a long history of COPD. He has an 80-pack-year
of smoking history and is normally on 2 liters of nasal cannula
at home. He was initially treated for COPD on the floor and
given gentle hydration as he also suffers chronic renal
insufficiency. He was given Percocet for pain control. The
patient appears to be improving by serial arterial blood gasses.
Had decrease in creatinine and improved mental status. At 11:00
a.m. on the 6/29/2004 the patient was found breathless and
pulseless. At that time , his ABG showed a pH of 7.04 , PCO2 of
95 , PO2 of 47 , he was sating 54%. An ACLS code was 1. The
patient received 1 mg atropine and 0.04 of Narcan. He appeared
to be aspirating when intubated. He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he was until 2/17/2004 , when he was
discharged.
ALLERGIES: The patient has questionable penicillin allergies
with unknown reaction.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM:
In general , the patient is an obese Hispanic male who is sedated
and intubated. He responds to commands and is oriented to voice
on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. His skin showed
his lower extremities with changes of chronic venostasis. He had
erythema to the knees , nonpitting edema bilateral to the knees
and induration of skin on legs , medial thigh , and bilateral
popliteal fossae. His feet had onychomycosis bilaterally with no
clearcut abrasions or cuts. The rest of his skin exam was
remarkable for multiple ecchymoses , one weeping plaque on the
abdomen at heparin injection site. His right subclavian line was
nontender and nonerythematous with one leaking port. Head and
neck exam: His pupils were equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodations. His extraocular movements were intact. His
oropharynx was clear. His endotracheal tube and OG tube were in
place. His chest sounds were clear anteriorly. He had decreased
breath sounds laterally. He had isolated wheezing at the left
midclavicular line. His heart sounds , S1 and S2 were heard. His
abdomen was obese. He had a large panus , no appreciable
organomegaly , tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Extremities: He was moving all four extremities spontaneously.
They were warm and perfused. Neurologically , his cranial nerves
were grossly intact. There were no focal anomalies.
On addition , the patient had a sodium of 140 , a potassium of 5.4 ,
chloride of 104 , carbon dioxide of 24 , BUN of 72 , creatinine of
2.1 , glucose of 153. She had an ionized calcium of 1.04 and
magnesium of 2.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary. The patient was admitted to the MICU with
hypercarbic respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia per
symptoms , signs and chest x-ray. Given the history and timing of
the arrest , the patient likely was hypercarbic secondary to COPD
exacerbation , as hypercarbic arrest occurred several days in
house where opiates were not administered. It is highly
improbable that the arrest happened secondary to opiate ingestion
rather patient likely had COPD exacerbation. Also , the patient
has significant cardiac history of CHF and CAD , which may have
contributed. Subsequent chest CT on the floor demonstrated that
in addition the patient had very significant pleural effusions.
The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with
levofloxacin and Flagyl and aztreonam. He was also treated with
albuterol Atrovent nebulizers. Aggressive physical therapy was
also provided for the patient. The patient after completing his
antibiotic treatments for aspiration pneumonia was noted to have
MRSA growing in his sputum. He was given a 14-day course of
vancomycin as well to treat MRSA pneumonia. To help the
patient&apos;s pulmonary status , significant diuresis was attempted.
The patient was typically diuresed at 1-2 liters per day. The
aggressive diuresis was estimated to have taken in the
neighborhood of 15-20 liters of the patient and this likely
remarkably helped the patient&apos;s breathing status and his ability
to get off the ventilator. The patient had a tracheostomy and
peg placed on 8/27/04 and began breathing on trache collar on
the 6/11/04 and has been breathing until the present time
successfully on trache collar.
2. ID. The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. He
was also colonized with MRSA and VSE by the end of his course.
During his initial MICU admission he was diagnosed with
vancomycin sensitive enterococcal UTI. He was treated with
antibiotics for all of these. His aspiration pneumonia was
treated with levofloxacin , aztreonam and Flagyl. Subsequent MRSA
pneumonia was treated with vancomycin. The patient has not had ,
at the time of admission , white count or a significant fever and
his cultures two days prior to discharge have been negative.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient has a significant cardiac
history for CHF and CAD. His heart rhythm has been mostly stable
during the course of his hospitalization. Hypertension has been
treated with Lopressor.
4. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. However , renal function had improved during the
patient&apos;s hospital course. At the time of discharge , the patient
had a creatinine of 0.9 , a BUN of 38 , a potassium of 3.9 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Presumably , the aggressive diuresis that was
conducted did not affect the patient&apos;s renal function adversely.
5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He was put on Lantus
and insulin sliding scale , by the end of his day he was on 80
units of Lantus plus requiring additional insulin on the sliding
scale.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code. The proxy for the patient is his
daughter , Picot , who was actively involved in the patient&apos;s care.
NUTRITION:
The patient was fed on Jevity tube feeds during most of his
medical ICU course.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient&apos;s physical exam was notable for a tracheostomy in
place with a clean site of insertion. GJ tube placed in the
abdomen with a clean surgical wound. Clear sounding lungs with
breath sounds that can be heard more extensively than before from
the anterior side , resolving chronic venostasis and with those
exceptions the patient&apos;s exam remain similar to his admission
exam. In general , the patient is interactive , alert and
oriented.

CONSULTANTS:
Hematology of BH , Dr. Bradley Ebanks .
ASSESSMENT:
This is an 88-year-old Co Louis Awestinsde male with a history of
hypertension , diabetes , CHF who presented with increasing
shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF and also presented
with a fever concerning for pneumonia for which he was treated
with antibiotics. The patient also had a new diagnosis of
amyloid during this admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: The patient has no known diagnosis of CAD;
however , he has many risk factors. The patient had a troponin of
0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. This troponin leak
was thought to be due to demand. The patient remained chest
pain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acute
ischemic issues. The patient was continued on his aspirin ,
beta-blocker and statin medications.
B. Pump: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
In the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumably
attributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. However ,
during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that was
positive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the cause
underlying his CHF. The patient appeared mildly fluid overloaded
on admission. He was successfully diuresed with 100 IV Lasix for
several days. The patient has been switched to his home dose of
Lasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several days
prior to his discharge. His euvolemic weight on 8/10/07 was
64.5 kilograms. His discharge weight will be reported in an
addendum. During this admission , he was continued on his
beta-blocker. His calcium channel blocker and diltiazem was
discontinued during this admission given his likely restrictive
heart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. The patient
was started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reduce
preload. As mentioned above , the patient had a catheterization
with an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. A
panel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. Of
note , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time of
discharge. Of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation test
that was within normal limits. The patient had a urine
immunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with Lambda
light chain. The patient also had a serum-free light chain assay
that was equivocal/positive. The patient also had positive
proteinuria on a spot urine. The patient also had a bone marrow
biopsy done by Dr. Jarred Canner of MOMH in order to further
define this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in order
to facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. He
also had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on his
urine immunofixation test.
C. Rhythm: The patient has a pacemaker originally put in for
sick sinus syndrome. He is V-paced. The patient was discovered
to be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. On 7/9/07 , the
EP Service changed the pacemaker setting to VVI given that the
patient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rate
to the 60s-70s. The patient remained on telemetry throughout his
stay which was uneventful. The patient was also started on
Coumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation and
the diagnosis of amyloid. The patient remained subtherapeutic
and on 7/11/07 , his INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and he
will most likely be discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg every evening
which will be adjusted as necessary at the Rehabilitation
Facility.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient presented with a mild cough.
The patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one to
two days on antibiotics. The patient had no leukocytosis.
Again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray and
his clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. The patient
received a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. The
course of antibiotics ended on 1/27/07 .  The patient had blood ,
urine and sputum cultures which were negative.
3. Heme: The patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of
31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. The
patient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets at
approximately 170 which remained stable throughout his
hospitalization and again the patient as stated above was started
on Coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and for
amyloid. The Coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg given
subtherapeutic INR. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on
5/10/07 as mentioned above in order to further define the
amyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urine
immunofixation. The final results of the bone marrow biopsy are
pending.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. At first ,
he was on his home dose of NPH insulin which was 20 units
subcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. Because
of persistent hypoglycemia , the patient&apos;s NPH was reduced to 10
units of NPH insulin subcutaneous daily.
5. FEN: The patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluid
restriction and was seen by Nutrition inhouse.
6. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0
which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.
7. GI: The patient has chronic LFT abnormalities likely
secondary to CHF; however , the etiology is uncertain.
8. Question restless leg syndrome: On 2/19/07 , the patient was
complaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an old
problem. His general exam was within normal limits. He was
given a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.
9. Low back , sacral pain: His low back pain appears to be
chronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. The
patient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttock
which showed no signs of infection and a DuoDERM was placed over
it for wound care. The patient also had a stage I sacral
decubitus ulcer and a DuoDERM was placed on it for wound care and
for protection.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was on DVT dose Lovenox inhouse
and was also on Coumadin.
11. Physical Therapy: Of note , the patient has a left BKA. The
patient&apos;s family brought in his prosthetic leg as well as his
walker. Physical Therapy inhouse worked with the patient , and it
was determined that the patient was unsafe to go home and it was
recommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility to which the
patient finally agreed.

Discharge Date: 8/23/1996
DIAGNOSIS: 1 ) LEFT THIGH CELLULITIS , LEFT THIGH ABSCESS , STATUS
POST I&amp;D.
2 ) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Bradham is a pleasant 52 year old
obese black female with history of
diabetes , chronic lower extremity venous stasis , history of
cellulitis who presented with left lower extremity pain , edema , and
erythema. The patient has had a long history of diabetes since
1984 for which she has been treated with diet and glyburide with
poorly controlled blood sugars until Metformin was added in
October of 1996. In the past five years the patient has also
become morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds.
Since 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lower
extremity swelling. In October of 1996 she was treated for diabetic
stasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV
antibiotics. Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was
attributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was
thought to be compromising venous return. Her massive edema was
treated unsuccessfully with Lasix.
The patient was doing well until about a week prior to admission
when she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowel
movements a day. Her stool was watery brown without any blood or
mucus. She also reported some nausea and vomiting as well as
chills. She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatures
were not measured. One day after the onset of her diarrhea the
patient noted the development of burning pain on her left anterior
thigh just above her knee. This was associated with increased
erythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. She reports
that her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thigh
the previous day. This area of erythema on her left leg
subsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and was
associated with increasing pain. The pain was so severe that it
prevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking.
The patient presented to the Emergency Department on 4/8 for
worsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake.
On the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea had
resolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. She has had no
chest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs of
infection except her left leg. On admission she was found to have
a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and she was placed in the
Short Stay Unit. Subsequently her admission labs were noted to
reveal elevated LFTs and an elevated BUN and creatinine with a
white blood cell count of 35 , 000. Because of these abnormalities
and renal failure , the patient was transferred out of the Short
Stay Unit to the General Medicine team for further care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Bilateral lower extremity edema with chronic
venous stasis changes. HIstory of cellulitis. History of
hypertension. Uterine fibroid. Hypercholesterolemia.
Osteoarthritis. Hemoglobin C trace.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. Lisinopril 20 mg
b.i.d. Lasix 80 mg q a.m. Metformin
500 mg b.i.d. Naprosyn 375 mg b.i.d. p.r.n.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM SHORT STAY UNIT: Ancef 1 gram IV q 8.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Insulin sliding scale. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sister with diabetes mellitus.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies alcohol , cigarettes , or drug
use. The patient lives in Sa Na Oak and cares
for four young grandchildren.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese , pleasant , African
American woman in no apparent distress. Her
temperature was 99.4 , blood pressure 110/74 , pulse rate of 92 ,
respiratory rate 20 , O2 sat 96% on room air. Her HEENT exam was
nonicteric with moist oropharynx and no lesions. The neck was
supple without any lymphadenopathy. She had a right EJ IV line.
There were no carotid bruits. Her lungs were clear to auscultation
with no CVA tenderness. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.
There was a faint S4 and a loud P2 component to the S2 sound. Her
abdominal exam was obese , non-positive for bowel sounds. There was
mild tenderness over the periumbilical region with some fullness/
suggestion of a mass. There was no rebound or guarding , no right
upper quadrant tenderness , no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly ( exam
limited by obesity ). Her extremity exam revealed marked bilateral
swelling in both lower extremities with chronic stasis changes.
There were multiple venous plaques on the pretibial areas of both
legs with one venous plaque being ulcerated on the right pretib
area. Examination of her left thigh revealed a patch of erythema
and warmth that was very tender to the touch. Neurologic exam was
alert and oriented times three , intact cranial nerves III-XII.
There was slight decrease in sensation in the patient&apos;s lower
extremity , left greater than right to pin sensation. Her motor
exam was otherwise unremarkable. Her rectal exam was reported to
be guaiac negative per the Emergency Department.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION: Sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 43 , and
creatinine of 3.7. The patient&apos;s last
creatinine value on record was in September of 1996 which was 0.6. Her
LFTs revealed an ALT of 71 , AST of 57 , LDH 717 , alkaline
phosphatase 196 , total bilirubin 1.1 , direct bilirubin 0.6. Her
amylase was 8. Her albumin was 2.1 and her calcium was 8.2. Her
CBC on admission revealed a white cell count of 34 , 000 , hematocrit
of 29 , and platelets of 624 , 000. The differential on the white
blood cell count was 78 polys , 38 bands , 6 lymphs , 3 monocytes , and
no eos. Her MCV on her hematocrit was 77. Her PT and PTT were
both within normal limits. Her urinalysis revealed 3+ protein , 1+
leukocyte esterase , 8-12 white blood cells , 20-25 red blood cells ,
and 2+ squamous epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed low lung volumes with possible
left total effusion that was blurring left lower lobe air space
disease. Abdominal ultrasound performed on admission revealed no
hydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system. Study was limited
secondary to body habitus. Lower extremity non-invasive studies
revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. However , exam was
limited secondary to habitus.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By issues:
1. Left thigh cellulitis: The patient was started on Ancef
renally dosed for her left thigh cellulitis. Her legs were kept
raised and her white blood cell and fever curves followed. An
Infectious Disease consult as well as a Dermatology consult was
obtained to assist with antibiotics as well as dressing for her
lower extremity changes. Blood cultures and wound cultures sent
did not reveal any organisms. Because of the patient&apos;s very high
white blood cell count , the ID consult team was concerned for the
possibility of toxic shock syndrome; therefore , Clindamycin IV was
also added to her regimen of antibiotics. Also per ID
recommendation , stool cultures were sent for E. coli 0167: H7 which
was negative. Although there was an initial fall in the patient&apos;s
white count during the first several days of antibiotics , this
white count subsequently began rising again. This was associated
with continued poor resolution of the pain in the patient&apos;s left
thigh and perhaps worsening erythema. Because the patient&apos;s left
leg did not appear to be getting better on antibiotics , a Surgical
consult was obtained to rule out a deeper seated infection in the
patient&apos;s thigh. Imaging of the patient&apos;s leg with MRI was
attempted but was unsuccessful secondary to the patient&apos;s large
size. A CT of both of her legs were obtained instead which
revealed no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it did
incidentally detect a large effusion in the patient&apos;s left knee.
One week after admission the patient noted acute worsening of the
pain in her left knee. Because of the known left knee effusion , a
concern for a septic knee joint was raised. A Rheumatology consult
was obtained. The left knee was tapped using ultrasound guidance
removing 20 cc of turbid knee fluid. Studies on the left knee
effusion revealed 13 , 000 white blood cells with negative gram stain
and negative crystal exam times 3. Cultures of the left knee fluid
did not grow any organisms. Despite these findings , we were still
concerned that this was a partially treated septic joint given the
patient had been on antibiotics for one week. For this reason an
Orthopedic consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the OR
for possible debridement. On 6/19 the patient was taken to the
Operating Room where an abscess on the left lateral distal thigh
was found and drained. A total of approximately 20 cc of pus was
removed by Dr. Sudler . There was no connection between the pus
collection and the left knee effusion. After the drainage , the
patient&apos;s clinical status improved dramatically with a decrease in
her white count and increased mobility of her leg. She was
continued on Ancef IV and p.o. Ofloxacillin which had been added
for gram negative coverage. The Clindamycin was subsequently
discontinued. On the day prior to discharge the patient&apos;s white
blood cell count had fallen to 10 , 000. She remained afebrile.
2. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have a creatinine
of 3.7 with a baseline known to be 0.6 in September of 1996. However , on
searching through the patient&apos;s records it appears that the patient
had been noted to have increased proteinuria since September of 1996.
The acute renal failure was initially thought to be secondary to
dehydration; the patient was given IV hydration with no improvement
in her creatinine. For that reason , a Renal consult was obtained
on the third day of admission. It was the impression of the Renal
Service that the patient&apos;s acute renal failure was likely
multifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy ,
low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , and
medications which included NSAIDs as well as ACE inhibitor. For
that reason , the patient&apos;s nephrotoxic medications , which include
Lisinopril and Metformin , were discontinued. The patient&apos;s
electrolytes and volume status was followed closely for the rest of
the course of the hospitalization with continued gradual
improvement. Her creatinine peaked at 4.7. On discharge the
patient&apos;s creatinine had resolved back to 2.2.
3. Right upper extremity swelling: On the day after the patient
returned from the Operating Room for the drainage of her left
thigh , she was found to have new onset of swelling in her right arm
and breast. Initially we were concerned for the presence of a
right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Upper extremity
non-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for any
clots. An echocardiogram was also obtained showing no evidence of
right heart dysfunction. A nuclear flow study was also attempted
but was unsuccessful because of the failure to obtain venous access
on the patient&apos;s right arm. The Leahgulf Mary Katon Hospital team was also
consulted regarding the use of heparin. However , given that the
patient had poor access and had an anemia , it was decided that the
patient would not be heparinized. Her right upper extremity
swelling was observed closely and with elevation of the right arm
over the next few days gradually resolved without any
complications. On the day prior to discharge a repeat right upper
extremity ultrasound was obtained which revealed no evidence of
blood clots in her right arm.
4. Hematology: On admission the patient was found to have a low
hematocrit with a low MVC. Iron studies were performed which
revealed the likely presence of iron deficiency. For that reason
the patient was placed on iron sulfate 30 mg t.i.d. The patient
was guaiac negative , thus ruling out evidence of a chronic GI
bleed. The patient&apos;s anemia is also likely a reflection of her
renal dysfunction.
5. GI: Although the patient had experienced some diarrhea prior
to admission , her diarrhea resolved in the hospital. All of her
stool studies were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no
abnormalities in the patient&apos;s liver or biliary system to account
for the mild transaminitis found on admission. It is likely that
the patient had a bout of viral gastroenteritis a few days prior to
admission which resolved spontaneously.
DISPOSITION: To Hi Health .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ancef 1 gram IV q.8h. times 14 days.
Ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days.

Discharge Date: 10/12/2006
ATTENDING: KRAUS , RALEIGH LOUIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old female
who is transferred from an outside hospital for further
management of her CHF. The patient is a 67-year-old female with
history of coronary artery disease who was first evaluated back
in 2002 when she had a stent placed at THC for symptomatic
coronary artery disease. She reports feeling well until 10/14
when she developed substernal chest burning and pressure and was
admitted to Trowestpot Allch Memorial Hospital , where a dobutamine echo was
positive for ischemia , details unclear and she was transferred to
IIAH for further care. At Deran Medical Center ,
angiography was performed on 8/7/06 with placement of a Cypher
stent in her LAD. The evening following discharge , the patient
reported severe substernal chest pressure and activated her local
EMS. On the way to the hospital , she suffered a Vfib arrhythmia
requiring CPR and 9 defibrillations. At Geft.o Ton Memorial Hospital ,
she was acutely intervened upon with PTCA and found to have a
thrombosed LAD stent. At this point , she was transferred to
R. Medical Center Of on an intraaortic balloon pump for
support. Repeat angiography was performed revealing suboptimal
deployment of the initial stent , which was subsequently outsized
to a diameter of 3.5 mm and additional stenting was performed
distal to the original stent with good anterograde flow noted
postprocedure. The patient was managed in the CCU , where she
remained intubated on the intraaortic balloon pump. Hospital
course was notable for distributive and cardiogenic shock as well
as aspiration pneumonia and HSV , treated with acyclovir. She
improved after two weeks and was discharged on 5/14/06 with an
EF of 40% at the time of discharge. The patient was readmitted
to Tacan Hospital And on 6/16/06 with a CHF exacerbation , was
subsequently diuresed and discharged on 1/27/06 .
Echocardiography at that time demonstrated an EF of 55% with 2 to
3+ MR and RVSP of 45 mmHg. The patient represented to Harl Hospital on 9/23/06 reporting progressive dyspnea , weight
gain , PND , orthopnea and cough. At that time , she underwent
repeat angiography demonstrating RA 14 , RV 55/13 , PA 61/25/42 ,
PCWP 35 with V 246 , LHC with AO 86/57. Angiography revealed a
right dominant circulation and LMCA , which was patent , LAD 20%
mid , D1 40% , ostial left circumflex 20% mid , RCA 60% prox , LV
gram with an EF of 25% associated with global hypokinesis and
severe MR. The patient was subsequently transferred to Palm Health Systems for further management of her advanced heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant in addition to above for
hypertension , type 2 diabetes on insulin , obesity , COPD ,
hyperlipidemia , GERD , hypothyroidism , depression , status post
appendectomy and status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Include aspirin 325 daily , Lasix 80 mg
IV b.i.d. , Diovan 160 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , levothyroxine
88 mcg daily , Lipitor 20 mg daily , Zetia 10 mg daily , Aldactone
25 mg daily , Protonix 20 mg daily , Advair 500/50 one puff daily
and insulin 70/30 , 30 units subq b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Include erythromycin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and works in
a clothing company. She smokes 1-2 packs per day x46 years until
nine years ago. No alcohol use. No illicits.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports coronary artery disease in
one sibling. No premature cardiac catheterization. Mother died
of cervical cancer. Father died of alcoholism.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting , abdominal pain , hemoptysis , bright red blood per
rectum , hematochezia , or melena , no chest pain or palpitations.
Positive for cough and shortness of breath. No changes in mental
status or loss of consciousness , no dysuria , no exposures. No
recent travel. No presyncope or dizziness.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for creatinine of 1 from
baseline of 0.7 to 0.8. Hematocrit of 34 , baseline 37. ALT 68 ,
AST 33 and alkaline phosphatase 384 down from 616 on last
admission. INR 1. EKG , sinus rhythm at 90 , normal axis
intervals with old anterior septal MI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for afebrile , heart rate in the
90s , blood pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 18-20 , satting 98% on
3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress , pleasant ,
resting comfortably. Oropharynx clear. JVP 10 cm with 2+
carotids without bruits. No thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy.
Decreased breath sounds with bibasilar crackles with prolonged
expiratory phase and intermittent expiratory wheezing. Regular
rate and rhythm , S1 and S2. Notable S3 , no MR appreciated.
Abdomen was obese , distended , soft , nontender , no
hepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities , 1+
lower extremity edema to the shins with 1+ DP and PT pulses
bilaterally. Pretibial erythema , right greater than left. No
other rashes. Right groin minimally tender without bruit. Cath
site clean , dry , intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary , this is a 67-year-old female
with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , diabetes , coronary artery disease status post LAD
stent complicated by a subacute thrombosis with marked left
ventricular dysfunction with a reportedly revascularized right
coronary territory and severe MR on repeat echo. Despite
diuresis at the outside hospital , the patient remained volume
overloaded with biventricular failure on exam. The patient was
admitted to medically optimized heart failure regimen to further
clarify component of mitral regurgitation. Repeat TTE and right
and left heart catheterization to further evaluate and optimize
medical management. The patient was maintained on aspirin ,
Plavix , ARB , statin and Zetia. Beta-blocker was continued at low
dose given decompensated state. Adenosine MIBI was completed ,
which was notable for recovery 1 mm ST depressions in leads II ,
III and aVF , which resolved. There is no further evidence of
ischemia. EF was notable to be severely depressed; however ,
moderate MR on outside hospital echo was not reproducible here.
Cardiovascular surgery was initially consulted to further
evaluate for benefit of mitral valve replacement surgery;
however , this will likely not be of benefit given mild MR on
repeat echo. In addition a contrast echo was performed to
further evaluate for evidence of clot given the severe right
ventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however ,
there was no evidence of clot on echo. In addition , on echo ,
reevaluated for dyssynchrony , which was negative. The patient
was diuresed with IV Lasix until near euvolemic and then
transitioned to p.o. regimen. The patient was maintained on
Aldactone. The EP service evaluated for possible placement of
AICD versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patient
is not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible on
EP study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient with
repeat echo in 2 months and a further EP study to readdress. The
patient will be anticoagulated in the meantime. Respiratory:
The patient has history of COPD with no evidence of acute
exacerbation. Inhalers were continued. PFTs and VO2 study may
be considered as an outpatient. Renal: Creatinine was mildly
elevated compared with baseline , likely secondary to mild dye
nephropathy and overaggressive diuresis. Creatinine stabilized ,
will need to be followed closely as an outpatient as well as
electrolytes. GI. The patient was maintained on a bowel
regimen. LFTs were elevated on admission consistent with right
heart failure versus statin. LFTs trended down on admission.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable at baseline. The
patient will remain on heparin to Coumadin bridge with Lovenox
bridge as an outpatient if needed. Endocrine: The patient has a
history of poorly controlled diabetes and was maintained on
insulin as an inpatient with sliding scale coverage. History of
hypothyroidism , on Levoxyl. TSH within normal limits. ID: No
acute issues. The patient was treated for asymptomatic
bacteriuria secondary to possible permanent pacemaker placement.
She developed itchiness , which is likely secondary to the
Bactrim. Provided supportive care , the patient should avoid
Bactrim in the future secondary to intolerance. No serious
reactions were observed. Psychiatric: The patient has a history
of depression. She was continued on home medications. FEN: The
patient was maintained on a cardiac diet with sodium and volume
restriction , K mag scales. Nutrition was consulted.
Dermatologic: The patient has a history of HSV , status post
acyclovir treatment. No evidence of further infection. The
patient had pretibial erythema , which derm was consulted for ,
which they felt was consistent with venous stasis. She improved
with steroid cream and compression. The patient was prophylaxed
with Protonix and heparin. The patient was instructed to follow
up with cardiology , weigh herself daily with careful notice to
weight gain reporting to the physician and to returne to the ED
with worsening shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient
was instructed to follow a fluid restricted , low-fat ,
low-cholesterol diet as well as a restricted sodium diet. She
will follow up with her PCP Dr. Kuhnke at 786-179-5001 on
1/4/06 at 2:45. Dr. Yatsko at 051-469-9935 on 3/12/06 at 3:45.
INR will be drawn on 1/1/06 with followup INRs to be drawn
every five days. INRs will be followed by PCP.

Discharge Date: 11/29/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1 ) OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA.
2 ) CHRONIC HYPOXIA.
3 ) STATUS POST HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY ARREST.
4 ) OBESITY.
5 ) MILD HYPERTENSION.
6 ) RECURRENT LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VENOUS
THROMBOSES.
7 ) OSTEOARTHRITIS SECONDARY TO MECHANICAL
DERANGEMENTS SECONDARY TO OBESITY.
8 ) TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS.
9 ) DEPRESSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year-old morbidly
obese black female with a history of
restrictive lung disease , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent lower
extremity deep venous thromboses requiring multiple
hospitalizations who was initially evaluated on March , 1996 for
right knee pain. Evaluation revealed a small right knee effusion
consistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity. The
tap was negative for crystals and had negative cultures. The
patient was initially supposed to go home , however due to
inadequate support , she was kept overnight on the evening of September , 1996. Overnight she received Vistaril , Percocet as well as
some Demerol and Oxycodone. On the morning of March , 1996 , she
was found to be unresponsive with bloody saliva dripping from her
mouth. A Code Green was called. They were unable to find a blood
pressure. The patient was intubated. Dopamine was started.
Narcan was given. The blood pressure recovered. The patient
awakened and the patient&apos;s initial arterial blood gas prior to
intubation was 7.04 pH , pCO2 137 and pO2 of 85 and she was
subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for
a restrictive lung disease. Past pulmonary
function tests revealed an FEV of 1.8 which is in the 56th
percentile and FEV1 of 1.6 which is in the 59th percentile , TLC of
3.3 in the 54th percentile and DLCO at 116th percentile. She has
been on long term home oxygen with oxygen saturation between 85%
and 90% on two liters of nasal cannula. Arterial blood gases on
prior admissions have revealed pO2 in 50 , pCO2 in the high 40s to
low 50s. She has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. She has
been evaluated in the past with even trace apnea screen in August
of 1994 which revealed approximately 19 apnea events in just over
10 hours. The oxygen saturation decreased to 61% at the minimum
and subsequently she had respiratory monitoring in September of 1995 with
C-PAP which revealed a decrease in the apnea episodes to 19 events
in about 480 minutes with oxygen saturation decreasing to a minimum
of 71%. Apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start the
patient on the C-PAP at home , but the patient had been resistant
and she has a long history of medical non-compliance. She has a
history of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she has had
multiple medical admissions , most recently about six in the past
year , most recently in October of 1996 , for cellulitis of the left
lower extremity , in July of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness with
negative non-invasive studies and in September of 1996 , most recently
with right lower extremity cellulitis and this was complicated by
apparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. The patient
has had multiple VQ scans in the past , all of which have been low
probability. The patient has been on chronic Coumadin , however
there is a question of whether or not , she has been taking it
regularly. There has also been a question in the past of possible
diastolic dysfunction. In September of 1994 , she had an
echocardiogram which showed some left ventricular hypertrophy , no
regional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of
approximately 55% , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspid
regurgitation. Other past medical history includes a history of
depression. The patient has been managed with Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.
day. She is status post midline hernia repair. She is status post
bilateral tubal ligation. The patient has chronic hypoxemia ,
obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic lower extremity deep
venous thromboses and obstructive lung disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. 4 ) K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q. day. 5 )
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q. day. 7 ) Lasix
20 mg p.o. q. day. 8 ) Coumadin alternating 10 mg with 7.5 mg p.o.
q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for the patient living alone. She
occasional has her son stay with her. She is
divorced and she has refused chronic care in the past.
HABITS: Positive for cigarettes about a 20 pack year history. No
alcohol , no intravenous drugs.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Pulmonary: The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on March , 1996
status post a respiratory arrest thought to be secondary to
hypercarbia through the combination of the patient&apos;s underlying
lung disease as well as excessive sedation. She was intubated on
March , 1996 and quickly extubated on April , 1996 without
complications. Her chest x-ray on admission was significant for a
mild interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. After
extubation , the patient was weaned to bi-PAP with which she was
able to maintain saturations between 86-90% while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit. The patient was transferred to the floor on
February , 1996. Given the patient&apos;s history of restrictive lung
disease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up to
search for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs.
parenchymal disease. She had an echocardiogram on August , 1996 ,
which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% , mild left ventricular
hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities , a top normal
sized right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and a
suggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm of
Mercury plus the estimated right atrial pressure. This
echocardiogram was performed with a bubble study and there was no
obvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or saline
infusion. They were unable to exclude diastolic dysfunction given
the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Her chest CT on
August , 1996 was significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonary
edema , patchy opacities in the right apex and lung bases with a
nodular quality of unclear etiology and a lucent lesion in the
right lobe of the liver that was too small to characterize. In
order to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lung
disease , the patient underwent a PA gram on September , 1996 to rule
out the possibility of chronic pulmonary emboli. This study
revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. She had a normal
pulmonary vascular distribution , elevated right heart pressures
with pulmonary arterial pressure of 44/13 with a mean of 28 mm of
Mercury , right ventricular pressure 52/2 with a mean of 20 mm of
Mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23. The
Pulmonary Service had been consulted and it was thought that it was
difficult to sort out exactly what was going on. It was unclear
what the nodular lesions described on the CT represented , whether
it was inflammation or some sort of firm nodule. It was decided to
follow-up on the CT in the future and to have the patient had a
repeat sleep study as well as repeat pulmonary function tests. The
overall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was most
likely secondary to obesity. While the patient was on the floor ,
we attempted to restart her on the bi-PAP , however the patient
resisted using both the C-PAP and the bi-PAP practically every
night complaining that she had an upper respiratory infection that
made it difficult for her to wear the machine. On the evening that
she did actually try both the C-PAP and the bi-PAP , she was noted
to have labored breathing with the C-PAP at 5 mm of Mercury and
four liters nasal cannula with a pulse oximetry dropping to 81%.
When she switched to bi-PAP with settings of 12 mm of Mercury
inspiratory and 7 mm of Mercury expiratory , she was able to
maintain oxygen saturations between 88% and as high as 93% oxygen
saturation. Her oxygen saturations throughout hospitalization
ranged between 91-93% on two liters nasal cannula during the day
and as well as 88% overnight. It was decided that the patient
given her history would require bi-PAP on discharge as well as her
home oxygen.
2 ) Infectious Disease: The patient as noted above spiked a
temperature to 101 degrees on March , 1996 while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and subsequently never had elevated
temperatures nor an elevated white blood cell count. She was
started on Clindamycin and Ofloxacin intravenously and then
switched to p.o. on February , 1996 to complete a ten day course.
On March , 1996 , the patient as stated , remained afebrile
throughout her hospitalization and never had an elevated white
blood cell count. She did complain of upper respiratory symptoms
beginning on February , 1996 described as general head fullness ,
sinus tenderness and nasal congestion. She was started on Afrin 2
puffs b.i.d. for three days with some relief as well as Robitussin
and Sudafed. Her physical examination was notable some maxillary
sinusitis and the patient was actually discharged after a brief
time on Afrin nasal spray.
3 ) Cardiovascular: Echocardiogram was performed during this
admission and is as described above. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout this admission.
4 ) Hematology: The patient had a history of recurrent lower
extremity deep venous thromboses. She was maintained on Heparin
until all of her procedures had been completed and was restarted on
Coumadin on September , 1996. Her PT and PTT were followed until
the point that she had established a therapeutic INR. On August , 1996 , her PT and PTT were notable for a PT of 17.5 with a PTT
of greater than 200 and INR of 2.2. Heparin was discontinued and a
repeat PTT on the evening of July , 1996 revealed a PT of 18.5
and a PTT of 67.6 and an INR of 2.5. She was discharged the next
day on 7.5 mg of Coumadin q.h.s. Of note , the patient had been
admitted with about a 2 X 2 cm ulcer of her medial left malleolus
which appeared to heal well with granulation and scarred by the
time she had been discharged.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient as noted was admitted for evaluation
of right knee pain. The patient did not complain of right pain
subsequent to her discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Her cultures and crystals were negative and she is to follow-up as
an outpatient with the Rheumatologist in their clinic.
6 ) Endocrine: The patient maintained stable bowel sounds on
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day.
7 ) Gastrointestinal: The patient remained stable and was able to
tolerate a low cholesterol , low saturated fat diet and was
maintained on Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. However , on the date of
discharge , the patient was complaining of a burning sensation in
her throat after drinking orange juice which tended to come and go ,
but did not radiate and she was switched from Axid to Prilosec 20
mg p.o. q. day on March , 1996.
8 ) Gynecology: While on the floor , the patient started
complaining of some vaginal spotting. She has menopausal since her
40s and has had not had any recent gynecological following. It was
decided for the patient to either follow-up with her primary care
physician or with the GYN clinic at N&apos;ssciences Memorial Hospital for evaluation of this spotting for ruling out endometrial
carcinoma.
9 ) Neurological: The patient did not demonstrate any evidence of
depression and was stable on Zoloft.
10 ) General Care: The patient underwent Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy throughout the hospitalization. It was
thought that she would benefit greatly from inpatient pulmonary
rehabilitation or possibly weight loss reduction , however the
patient repeatedly declined pulmonary rehabilitation and weight
loss reduction and felt that she would be able to manage herself at
home.
The patient was discharged on March , 1996 in stable condition
to home with VNA services to follow-up on her blood sugars , her
home oxygen as well as her bi-PAP.

Discharge Date: 8/10/1994
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: PLEURISY , POSSIBLY SECONDARY TO A POST
VIRAL SYNDROME.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLI IN 1971
AND IN 1988.
2. HISTORY OF STREP PHARYNGITIS IN July
OF 1994 , TREATED WITH PENICILLIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54 year old female with
a history of pulmonary emboli in the
past , now with complaint of four days of pleuritic chest pain and
left arm heaviness. Coronary risk factors include a positive
family history , no smoking , diabetes mellitus , hypertension or
elevated cholesterol. The patient&apos;s history begins in 1971 when ,
after a tubal ligation , she had a pulmonary emboli which was felt
to be secondary to prolonged bedrest. She received Heparin and was
coumadinized for one year. In 1988 she had lower abdominal pain ,
extensive work up of which revealed a pulmonary emboli , and again
she was heparinized and coumadinized for one year. On September , 1994
she developed the acute onset of intermittent chest pressure and
left arm heaviness , associated with night sweats. There was no
shortness of breath , palpitations , light-headedness , nausea or
vomiting. The pain was exacerbated by deep breaths as well as
yawning and movement. It was not relieved by any factors. On the
morning of admission the discomfort progressed from intermittent to
constant and was unrelieved with two Advils , at which time she
subsequently presented to the W.coness- County General Hospital
Emergency Ward. In the Emergency Ward her examination was
negative. Chest x-ray was negative. VQ scan was with intermediate
probability. She received Heparin and was subsequently transferred
to the floor. She denied any fevers , chills , cough , shortness of
breath , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain or dysuria. It is
noteworthy that the patient had an Emergency Ward visit on April
at which time she complained of sore throat. Rapid Strep test was
positive for Strep pharyngitis. She was treated with a course of
Penicillin. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is as
above. She also has a history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding ,
iron deficiency anemia , lumbosacral disc disease , status post
laminectomy times three. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications on
admission are Motrin prn. ALLERGIES: She has no known drug
allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Her mother died from complications
from hypertension. Her father died from a cerebrovascular
accident. She has one sister who is deceased from burn injuries ,
one brother who passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 57 ,
and two brothers who passed away from natural causes. SOCIAL
HISTORY: She is a clerk. She is divorced with five children. She
never smoked. She drinks alcohol occasionally. She has no HIV
risk factors and no known TB exposures.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination she is a
well-developed , well-nourished female
appearing her stated age and in no apparent distress. Temperature
is 98 , pulse 94 , blood pressure 140/88 , and respirations 16. Heent
shows extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx revealed no
erythema , edema or exudate. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck was
supple with no lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally.
Lungs revealed right basilar rales. Coronary examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm with positive S1 and S2 and no S3 or S4.
There were no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft and
non-tender with positive bowel sounds. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or masses noted. Rectal was guaiac negative in
the Emergency Ward. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. Neurological examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 142 , potassium 4.1 , BUN 15 , creatinine
.8 , and glucose 74. Liver function tests were
within normal limits. CK was 697 with an MB of 8.5. White count
was 4.1 , hematocrit 37 and platelet count was 252 , 000. PT was
12.5 , PTT 29.3. Chest x-ray , which was a portable film , was clear.
VQ scan was read as intermediate probability. EKG revealed a sinus
bradycardia at 54 with normal axis and intervals. She had flipped
T waves in leads 3 , F , and V1 through V3 , biphasic T waves in V4 ,
flat T waves in V5 and V6. There was poor R wave progression and Q
waves in 1 and L.
HOSPITAL COURSE: It was felt that during the patient&apos;s
presentation the most likely diagnosis was a
pulmonary embolus , given her clinical history and her intermediate
probability of VQ scan. The elevated CK with the very low MB was
felt not to represent a myocardial infarction but to represent a CK
leak from presumed pulmonary infarction. The patient was
heparinized with the goal of maintaining her PTT in the 60 to 80
range. She had a thrombotic work up sent off , namely an
antithrombin 3 , protein C and protein S , all of which , with the
exception of the Russell viper venom , returned within normal
limits. The Russell viper venom is pending at the time of
dictation. The patient underwent lower extremity noninvasives on
hospital day number one which returned as negative. She had a D
dimer sent which was also normal. At this point the DVT Team here
at the Otver Hospital was consulted , given the
conflicted data for pulmonary emboli. The team felt that , given
the patient&apos;s clinical history and the implications of chronic
Coumadin therapy , that a pulmonary embolus should be definitely
ruled out by pulmonary arteriogram. On hospital day number two the
patient underwent a PA gram which revealed a mean RA pressure of 7
mm of mercury , a mean RV pressure of 12 mm of mercury , and no
filling defects to suggest a pulmonary embolus. At this point the
patient&apos;s Heparin was discontinued. The day prior to obtaining the
pulmonary arteriogram the patient had a good PA and lateral film ,
which revealed no focal infiltrates and no effusions. On hospital
day number three the patient underwent an echocardiogram which
revealed normal left ventricular size and mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with vigorous function and no regional wall motion
abnormalities. She had no pericardial thickening or pericardial
effusion to suggest pericarditis. She had structurally normal
cardiac valves , no significant mitral or tricuspid regurge. She
had a minimal amount of aortic regurgitation and normal right heart
size and function. At this point , given the fact that the patient
was not felt to have a myocardial infarction , given her low MB
total CK ratio , and also that she was not felt to have a pulmonary
embolus , given the negative PA gram , the diagnosis of pleurisy
secondary to possible close viral syndrome was considered. The
patient was started on Naprosyn at 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. on hospital
day number three , to which she responded quite well. After
discussion with the patient&apos;s primary doctor it was felt that ,
given the fact that serious causes for pleuritic chest pain had
been ruled out , the patient&apos;s management could be followed in an
outpatient setting. On hospital day number four it was felt that
she was safe to be discharged to home. Operations and procedures
performed during this hospitalization were pulmonary arteriogram by
Pa Hospital on April , 1994. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Discharge medications
include Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. with meals. The
patient is being discharged to home. FOLLOW UP: She will follow
up with Dr. Owen Albertine on August , 1994 at 1:30 p.m.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced with two children. No alcohol use
recently.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a MI at 73. Her mother died in
her 80s of emphysema.
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a creatinine of 1 , her ALT was
25 , AST was 35 , her hematocrit was 33 , her white count was 6.6 ,
and her platelets were 241 , 000. She had normal differential.
Her albumin was 3.5. Her urinalysis was dark , with 3+
leukoesterase , negative nitrates , greater than 200 white blood
cells per high peripheral , 2-4 red blood cells per high
peripheral , 1+ bacteria. Her EKG showed a sinus rhythm of 100.
Her left bundle branch block with a QTc of 500 , but no change
compared to baseline.
Her head CT showed an old right middle cerebral artery implant.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for initial
presentation with somnolence and altered mental status with one
hypotensive blood pressure by EMS , but subsequently no
hypotension in the absence of fluid resuscitation. Her urine
culture appeared to indicate an infection , and so she was covered
with antibiotics initially. It was also determined that she had
a significant polypharmacy and enumerable sedating medications at
her rehabilitation and there was suspicion that the medications
contributed to her initial presentation of somnolence and altered
mental status.
1. Infectious disease: The patient was initially treated with
vancomycin for a presumed repeated MRSA UTI. However , her urine
culture did not grow any bacteria , it only drew out yeast. Thus ,
she was transitioned over to a ciprofloxacin 700 mg p.o. b.i.d.
regime for a total of 12 days for a presumed urinary tract
infection.
2. F/E/N: She was tolerating oral food and medications and a
Nutrition consult was obtained. She had calorie counts which
showed adequate intake. She did not have any other metabolic
abnormality that required correction.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient&apos;s primary cardiovascular
abnormality was a prolonged QTc which occurred in the setting of
prior use of Haldol and other antipsychotics for behavioral
modification. Her QTc was monitored with serial EKGs. The
longest it had reached was 530 ms. Haldol was discontinued in
order to preserve the QTc. In addition , she was given some
amounts of Seroquel and her QTc was continued to be monitored.
4. Heme/Oncology: The patient has a history of stage III
non-small cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy and
is followed by her outpatient oncologist , as well as the
outpatient psychosocial oncology social worker , as well as the
psychosocial oncology physician whose name is Chet Nave .
5. Neurological: The patient is status post both a large right
MCA stroke , as well as a right-sided carotid endarterectomy from
a previous admission. Her neurological deficits are consistent
with her prior neurological deficits. Specifically , they include
a left-sided hemiparesis , as well as agnosia on the left side.
Her mental status included intermittent disorientation. She was
generally at her best , alert and oriented to herself , as well as
her age , as well as her location in the Domo Ings Hospital .  However , she would intermittently loose track of where
her location was and believed that she was in Naimas West Hospital , not in
the hospital. She was also intermittently confused. She also is
complicated , given her histories of seizures and stroke. It was
considered initially that her altered mental status was due to
polypharmacy. However , her sedating medications were
discontinued including her Reglan was discontinued as well as her
baclofen , Dilaudid and trazodone. Her Cymbalta was continued per
the recommendations of the Psychiatry consult. The psychiatric
consultants also suggested a one-to-one sitter. At no time was
the patient actively suicidal or homicidal. It was also later
decided that her Dilaudid would be discontinued. In addition ,
her standing Seroquel was made p.r.n. In addition , the
patient&apos;s family also suggested that the patient&apos;s base mental
status did not improve despite removing all the medications. At
this point , a Neurology consult was obtained. This Neurology
consult is pending at the time of this dictation and will be
reported in a later dictation. Given the patient&apos;s history of
complex seizures and olfactory hallucinations , she was continued
on her Lamictal , as well as her Cymbalta , which was for her
history of depression.
6. Pain: The patient&apos;s pain in her left hand existed and she
was treated with tramadol and Tylenol for this pain. She could
not specifically describe this pain.
7. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on Novolog sliding
scale for diabetes. She was also continued on a replacement dose
levothyroxine for her history of Graves&apos; and a history of
radioiodine ablation. For behavioral modification , as well as
for intermittent agitation and disorientation , the patient was
maintained on p.r.n. Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , as well as
Zydis 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. This was titrated from standing to
p.r.n. over the course of her hospitalization in order to try to
decrease any sedating medications that may be altering her
alertness and orientation.
NOTE: This dictation will be addended at a later date with
discharge medications , as well as further hospital course and the
patient&apos;s neurological state , as well as any follow up that is to
be planned.

Discharge Date: 7/6/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: VOMITING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old female
with a past medical history of
diabetes and hypertension who was recently admitted from October ,
2000 through July , 2000 with abdominal pain diagnosed with
diverticulitis , treated with levofloxacin , ampicillin and Flagyl
and discharged home. However , subsequently , she began to have
several episodes of vomiting that was initially clear and then
turned brown with some dark blood in the morning. The patient
denies any bright red blood per rectum or melena. In the emergency
department , the patient had a negative NG lavage and treated with
Compazine. She was also seen by Surgery whose initial assessment
was Flagyl related emesis and changing antibiotics to levofloxacin
and clindamycin. Gastrointestinal was also consulted who felt that
the blood was most likely from a Mallory-Weiss tear.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension , anemia , status post
cholecystectomy , status post appendectomy ,
small bowel obstruction , bilateral cataracts , bilateral tubal
ligation , diverticulitis , chronic renal failure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.4 , heart rate
88 , blood pressure 156/116 sitting , standing
169/74. ABDOMEN: Bowel sounds positive , soft and non-tender and
non-distended. RECTAL: Guaiac negative.
LABORATORY: White blood cell count was 7.7 , hematocrit 36.2 ,
platelet count 315. INR was 1.2 , PTT 26.6. BUN and
creatinine were 36 and 4.4 respectively. Amylase was 56 , lipase
151 , total bilirubin 0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 103.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Because of persistent nausea and vomiting despite
having stopped the Flagyl and decreased dose of
levofloxacin on April , 2000 , the levofloxacin was discontinued.
The patient had a gastric emptying study which was within normal
limits and did not show any evidence of gastroparesis. On January , 2000 , an upper endoscopy was done that revealed two discrete
esophageal ulcerations in the distal esophagus with surrounding
esophageal erythema , most likely consistent with pill esophagitis.
The patient was started on Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. and antibiotics
were stopped at that time as she had completed a ten day course.
In addition , the patient also had problems with hypertension to the
200s. This was treated with labetalol. Renal MRI study was done
that was negative for renal artery stenosis. The patient was
discharged home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lasix 160 mg p.o. q. day , NPH 40 units
subcutaneously q. AM , regular insulin 10
units subcutaneously q. AM , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lopressor

ATTENDING: DUDLEY SPERL MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 66-year-old female who presented with one day of
abdominal pain. She was constipated for seven days and presented
with abdominal pain on 10/17/04 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , atrial fibrillation on Coumadin ,
diabetes mellitus , high cholesterol , coronary artery disease ,
gallstones and diverticuli.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Nonsignificant.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
Avandia 4 mg b.i.d. , lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d. , Hytrin one q.h.s. ,
Lasix 80 mg x1 , spironolactone 25 mg x3 , atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. ,
Lipitor 10 mg x1 , Flovent , Bextra 10 mg x1 , Nexium 20 mg x1 ,
Humulin 22 units q.a.m. , Coumadin 5 mg , and baby aspirin 81 mg.
For this reason , the patient was admitted to the ED and the chest
x-ray at that time showed free air below the diaphragm. The KUB
showed dilated small bowel and the abdominal CT showed multiple
free air. For this reason , the patient was brought to the OR on
10/17/04 , the same day and she underwent exploratory laparotomy
and appendectomy as well. The patient had been diagnosed at that
time of perforated appendicitis. The surgery was uncomplicated
and the patient afterwards was transferred to the SICU. Please
refer to the interim dictation for the patient for the SICU
course. In the SICU , mainly she had three problems and for this
reason , she was kept in the unit. She had rapid atrial
fibrillation , oliguria , and confusion. The patient was
transferred back on the floor on 2/5/04 on no antibiotics and
was stable with NG tube in place and through this NG tube , the
patient was fed. The patient underwent speech and swallow
evaluation at that time and the Speech &amp; Swallow cleared her for
mechanical soft diet and the NG tube was discontinued.
The postoperative course mainly has been characterized by slow
recovery and decrease in mental confusion , for presence of
flatus , bowel movement and advanced diet to mechanical soft diet.
The patient also was restarted on Coumadin on postop day 9 , and
on postop day 13 , she was started also on baby aspirin. The
patient is discharged in stable condition.
On physical examination , she is alert and oriented x3.
Respiratory: She is clear in both lungs. She is saturating on
room air 92% during the day. However during the night and most
likely due to her position in the bed , she requires sometimes
oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula for saturation 97%. Cardiac: The
patient is in atrial fibrillation , stable condition. Heart rate
is controlled at 93. She is on atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. GI: The
patient is on mechanical soft diet. The abdomen is nonpainful.
Nondistended. Bowels sounds are present. The patient had
already bowel movement and she is passing flatus because she had
in the last two days three bowel movements in one day. C. diff
and leucocytes were sent that are so far negative. GU: The
patient is back on home Lasix 80 mg x1 plus spironolactone 25 mg
b.i.d. The patient has been voiding fine and with no problem in
urinating and the Foley was discontinued on postoperative day
#12. ID: The patient is on no antibiotics. Heme: The patient is
back on Coumadin and her INR is 3.5. She received yesterday a
dose of Coumadin 2.5 mg. She is back on baby aspirin also at 81
mg. She is also on subcutaneous heparin b.i.d. as prophylaxis
for DVT and she is also on pneumo boots.
The recent labs on discharge are glucose 100 , BUN of 6 ,
creatinine 0.8 , sodium 144 , potassium 3.3. She received a dose
of 20 mg p.o. potassium today. Chloride is 104 , CO2 32 , anion
gap 8 , calcium 8 , magnesium 1.8. PTT 34.7 , PTT 6.3 , INR is 3.5.
The patient is discharged with the following medications: Flovent
220 , INH x2 , Pepcid p.o. 20 mg b.i.d. , subcutaneous heparin 5000
units b.i.d. , atenolol 50 x2. She is on Seroquel 25 mg x1 p.o. ,
insulin scale , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , spironolactone 25 mg
b.i.d. , Simvastatin 10 mg x1 , baby aspirin 80 mg p.o. p.r.n. She
is on albuterol at 2.5 mg q.12h. and she is on Zofran for nausea.
She is on no pain medication and she does not have any pain.
The patient is discharged in stable condition and she will need
follow up with Dr. Ulysses Gunnett in three weeks and the patient
also will need to restart her Humulin dose for glucose control
and the patient will need to have anticoagulation and therefore
begin Coumadin for INR range between 2 and 3.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt underwent a Lt TSR , and biceps tenodesis on 4/30/06 for endstage OA.
Pt tolerated the proecdure well , and had an uncomplicated postoperative
course with exception of pain management issues. Pt was followed by the
POPS with acute pain managed with PCA , IV Ketamine , and adjustment of PO
Methadone dose. Pt was HD , and neurologically stable with no transfusion
requirements during her hospitalization. Standard care with prophylactic
IV abx , and TEDS/P-boots for DVT prophylaxis. Pt mobilized OOB with PT ,
and was seen PROM per Dr Berlin TSR protocol. Refer to the page 3 for
details. Wound was clean and helaing at time of discharge. PCA/Ketamine
was D/C&apos;d on POD 2 , and patient was transitioned to PO analgesics. Pt
stable for transfer to rehab on Alabama
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: DSD qd. The wound may be left OTA when dry. Patient may shower with an
occlusive dressing
Precautions:
7	Sling should be worn continuously for 3-4 weeks
7	While lying supine , a small pillow or towel roll should be placed
behind the elbow to avoid shoulder hyperextension / anterior
capsule stretch / subscapularis stretch. ( When lying supine
patient should be instructed to always be able to visualize
their elbow. This ensures they are not extending their shoulder
past neutral. ) - This should be maintained for 6-8 weeks
post-surgically.
7	Avoid shoulder AROM.
7	No lifting of objects
7	No excessive shoulder motion behind back , especially into
internal rotation ( IR )
7	No excessive stretching or sudden movements ( particularly
external rotation ( ER ) )
7	No supporting of body weight by hand on involved side
7	Keep incision clean and dry ( no soaking for 2 weeks )
7	No driving for 3 weeks
7	Passive forward flexion in supine to tolerance
7	Gentle ER in scapular plane to available PROM ( as documented in
operative note ) - usually around 300
( Attention: DO NOT produce undue stress on the anterior joint
capsule , particularly with shoulder in extension )
7	Passive IR to chest
7	Active distal extremity exercise ( elbow , wrist , hand )
7	Pendulum exercises
Early Phase I: ( out of hospital )
7	Continue above exercises
7	Begin scapula musculature isometrics / sets ( primarily
retraction )
7	Continue active elbow ROM
7	Continue cryotherapy as much as able for pain and inflammation
management

Discharge Date: 10/10/2004
ATTENDING: CORTEZ DERICK SADLIER MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was admitted on 9/14/04
for a right plantar surface neurotrophic ulcer secondary to
diabetes mellitus. The patient has a long-standing history of
peripheral neuropathy and slight history of peripheral vascular
disease. This has been treated thus far by podiatric
debridements until the day of admission when the patient
presented low-grade fevers and chills. The patient also has a
history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , distant past of
pancreatitis , gout , neuropathy , high cholesterol , and chronic
renal insufficiency. He has had a left fourth and fifth toe
amputation before. He has also undergone recent eye surgery of
unknown origin and had some unknown pancreatic surgery in 1968
most likely for phlegmon or some sort of pancreatic condition.
The patient was admitted on 9/14/04 with a right plantar surface
neurotrophic ulcer as well as recent history of low-grade fevers
and chills.
The patient notes that the ulcer came about after some unknown
trauma to the foot. He had been followed by podiatrist and had
outpatient MRI revealing osteo at the fifth metatarsal head and
the fourth metatarsal shaft , presented to the Egan Healthcare
emergency department after having a fever of 101.3 degrees. On
admission , the patient had a low-grade fever of 99.7 degrees ,
pulse in the 90s , respiratory rate 16 , and blood pressure 144/67.
He was saturating 95% on room air.
MEDICATIONS:
At the time of admission were as follows:
1. Lantus 100 mg q.p.m.
2. Humalog 20 units q.p.m.
3. Humalog sliding scale.
4. Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.
5. Lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
6. Allopurinol 300 mg q.d.
7. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
8. Zocor 20 mg q.d.
9. TriCor 50 mg b.i.d.
10. Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
11. Eyedrops prednisolone and atropine.
12. The patient was on iron supplementation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable findings and/or that the patient
had clear breath sounds and regular rate and rhythm. On cardiac
examination had a slight murmur 2/6 along the left sternal border
and otherwise had a obese abdomen. The extremities and back
revealed no abnormalities except for a right foot ulcer along the
fourth and fifth metatarsal distal heads. The patient also had a
somewhat cyanotic appearing and somewhat edematous and swollen
fifth right toe. The patient had decreased sensation bilaterally
in the feet up to mid shin. The patient also had a known history
of drug allergies.
LABORATORY DATA:
At the time of admission , the patient&apos;s significant labs were as
follows , his potassium was 4.3 , BUN was 38 , creatinine was 3.2 ,
and his blood glucose was 187. His white blood cell count was
12.6 and hematocrit was 27.8.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service under
Dr. Tosco and was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl. He continued to have low-grade fevers over the course of
the next three days. Finally , on hospital day 3 , had a fever of
103.2. It was decided that at the time of admission , the patient
would need to undergo an amputation of the third and fourth toe
as well as metatarsal heads to remove the infected bone and
source of osteomyelitis. On hospital day 3 , the patient was
taken to the operating room. It should be noted at that time
that the patient&apos;s creatinine bumped before his operation from a
BUN of 39 and a creatinine of 2.1 to a BUN of 59 on hospital day
3 and a creatinine of 3.9. This occurred coincidentally the day
after the patient had several MRIs of is lower extremities to
better understand the vascular supply to his lower extremities.
Therefore , the patient had contrast dye. Although , this dye was
gadolinium , which is sued commonly for MRA and is not usually
associated with any soft of renal toxicities.
The patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 3 for
a right fourth and fifth toe amputation and nonhealing ulcer
debridement. Please refer to the operative note by Dr.
Guemmer for further details. The patient tolerated the
procedure without any problems and the patient control was
adequate by postoperative day 1. However on postoperative lab
checkup , it was see that the patient&apos;s creatinine bumped to 4.9
with a BUN of 61. This was viewed and was monitored by serial
BUN and creatinine checks. The following , BUN and creatinine
came back at 69 for BUN and 5.2 for creatinine. On postoperative
day #1 , the patient&apos;s creatinine continued to rise and was found
to be 6.5 with a BUN of 81. At this point , the renal service was
consulted for further input as far as possible causes of acute
renal failure in the phase of chronic renal insufficiency and
postoperative period. The patient&apos;s vancomycin level came to be
in the therapeutic range of 30.8. FENa was checked which
revealed 0.74% FENa. This was rechecked and revealed a FENa of
0.97% both , which indicated prerenal failure. Renal team also
advised checking for other causes of the patient&apos;s anemia as well
as other causes of the renal failure. Labs have been sent and
some are currently pending regarding the C3-C4 and anti-GMB
antibodies.
The patient&apos;s creatinine continued to rise despite advanced
management including with IV resuscitation , fluid volume boluses ,
and occasional boluses of Lasix. Eventually , the patient&apos;s BUN
and creatinine rose to 94 and 8.3 by postoperative day 2. By the
following day , however postoperative day 3 , the patient&apos;s
creatinine and BUN began resolving that BUN of 95 and a
creatinine 7.8. However , at the same time , the patient began
having hypoglycemic episodes in response to the Lantus dose that
he was getting at home and continue to get here in hospital. It
was summarized by the renal team as well as by the surgical
service and that the patient may have not been taking his
medication at home and now was being his medications , while here
in the hospital. By postoperative day 4 , the patient continued
to have dysregulation of his fingerstick blood glucoses ranging
from a high of 367 to a low of 52 where she began to be
symptomatic , somewhat somnolent , and groggy.
This patient&apos;s blood glucose control was evaluated by the
diabetes management service and it was summarized by them that
the patient&apos;s renal insufficiency had a significant role in the
patient&apos;s hypoglycemic episodes and that he ended up having
insulin toxicity due to poor creatinine clearance and renal
functioning level. It should be noted that in light of this
patient&apos;s postoperative complications of acute renal failure in
the phase of chronic renal failure and chronic renal
insufficiency , the patient never required a hemodialysis because
the potassium levels remained stable. The high that the patient
reached was 5.6 of potassium on the same day that he had a
creatine of 8.3 , which was on postoperative day #2 , This was
treated with kayexalate and along the same lines , the patient&apos;s
medications were evaluated and it was decided to decrease it to
b.i.d. dosing and to start holding lisinopril , Neurontin , and
vancomycin for their possible renal toxic effects. A renal
ultrasound was obtained on postoperative day #1 as well as
Doppler flow studies. The renal ultrasound revealed normal
parenchyma with somewhat decreased renal indices indicating some
decreased amount of blood flow to their kidneys. At the same
time , an MRA of the renal arteries was obtained which revealed no
stenosis lesions of the kidneys.
The patient was eventually started on PhosLo and Ferrlecit as
well as Epogen 10 , 000 units q. week at the recommendation of the
renal service. This was continued during the duration of the
patient&apos;s stay and should continue in the postoperative
hospitalization. In light of this postoperative complications ,
the creatinine became stable by postoperative day 3 and blood
pressure medications were restarted at previous doses and were
titrated to the need that the patient demonstrated by his blood
pressure control. This was eventually attained on atenolol at
150 mg q.d. However , renal service recommended that the patient
be given Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. This seems to have controlled
the patient&apos;s blood pressure for the time being. Physical
therapy was also involved in evaluating the patient and assisted
in the management of this patient&apos;s care.
It should also be noted that a wax sponge was placed on the
patient&apos;s right open wound. This was placed on postoperative day
#3 , 4/18/04 .  The patient seems to be tolerating this well. The
diabetes management service , the physical therapy , and the renal
teams continued to follow the patient closely during the duration
of his stay until it was felt that the patient&apos;s postoperative
complications and issues including blood glucose control as well
as renal insufficiency were under control. From an operative
standpoint , the patient tolerated the procedure well and it was
decided to continue the patient on levofloxacin for a one week
course and the patient is to be discharged to the rehab facility ,
which is the Still Freedral Hospital for their ability to
care for wax sponge excellently.
The patient was seen by Dr. Ulvan in the renal staff and by the
diabetes management service by Dr. Clint Holets , pager #596-76. The
physical examination at the time of discharge was unchanged from
the previous few days where the patient was seen to have adequate
Doppler signal in all his pedal pulses , DPs as well as PTs and a
faintly palpable right DP and as well as faintly palpable left
DP.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
86 yo man w/ acute renal failure , gross hematuria , bladder mass.
RENAL:
*ARF* Original ddx included prerenal ( decreased PO intake , glucosuria )
vs. renal ( URI --&gt; glomerulonephritis ) vs. postrenal ( mass , clots --&gt;
B obstruction ... but no hydronephrosis ). Cr came down from 5.3 to near
nl w/ hydration suggesting prerenal etiology. Urine examined under
microscope was without red blood cell casts. On presentation , pt. had no
acute indication for dialysis. He was not uremic , had no rub , had good
urine output , had mild acedemia , and had normal K.As noted , his Cr came
down to near normal with hydration.
*bladder mass* A bladder mass surrounded by blood clots was identified on
the patient&apos;s admission CT. Due to conern for bladder cancer , urine
cytology was sent. Results are pending. On 8/19 , the urology team
performed a cystoscopy which revealed a large bladder stone surrounded by
hemorrhage. The clot was evacuated and the stone was broken up by
electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Biopsy samples were
taken from the inflamed bladder wall. Pathology results are pending. A
3-way foley catheter was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was
initiated. The patient received peri-procedure antibiosis with ancef and
gent. The large size of the bladder stone suggests urinary retension ,
perhaps due to persistent BPH ( despite 2000 TURP ). The patient was started
on flomax and proscar , as recommended by the urology team. The patient was
discharged with a foley catheter in place. He will return to NC urology
clinics on 10/22 for a voiding trial.
CV:
pump
*HTN* In house , pt. was treated with norvasc and lopressor. He was
discharged on norvasc and toprol XL. Ace inhibition was not initiated due
to the patient&apos;s renal insufficiency.
*murmur* On exam , pt. had a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
R and L upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. An ECHO
revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 65% , no RWMA , nl
diastolic function , normal RV size and function , nl LA and RA size ,
and mild AS with a valve area of 1.4. The patient is not
symptomatic from his AS , by history. He denies syncope , chest pain ,
orthopnea , PND , or LE edema.
rhythm: NSR
ischemia:
*CAD*
Pt. reported no chest pain. His admission EKG showed new inferior/lateral
ST-T changes. Cardiac markers revealed CK 330 , CKMB 7.5 , and Tn I&lt;assay.
His EKG changes could represent old infarct ( although ECHO showed no
RWMA ) or could represent demand ischemia in the setting of
hypertension and anemia. Pt. was treated with a bblocker , as above. Pt was
not treated with ASA given his hematuria , but such
therapy may be started on an outpatient basis. Pt. was not treated with an
acei due to his creatinine , but such therapy , too , may be started on an
outpatient basis. Pt. may also benefit from outpt. stress testing. Lipids
profile showed cholesterol 156 , triglycerides 119 , HDL 39 , LDL 93.
GI: *reflux* Pt. was treated with nexium and mylanta PRN.
He was maintained on a cardiac , diabetic diet.
ENDO: *new DM , most likely type II* On admission pt. had a small anion
gap , mild elevation of +B-hydroxybutyrate , and +ketones in his urine.
With hydration , his gap closed. The ketoacidosis was likely from
starvation. Pt&apos;s HGa1c was 10. ( He had not seen a physician in years ). He
will be d/c&apos;ed on glipizide 5. ( Metoformin was not started out of concern
for rising creatinine. He may benefit from the addition of a second oral
agent as an oupatient ). Pt. will be given a glucometer and asked to check
his blood sugar mornings.
HEME: *anemia* Pt. had a normocytic anemia , likely related to hematuria ,
gu+ stool. Iron studies revealed a Fe 49 , TIBC 294 , Ferr 73. He
was started on a multivitamin with iron. He would benefit from outpatient
colonoscopy. Prior to discharge , hematocrit was stable in the mid 30s.
ID: Pt. was afebrile. Admission u/a was suggestive of UTI. Ucx , however ,
was negative. CXR was clear. Pt. received abx peri-cystoscopy.
PROPH: pneumoboots ( pt. was not treated with lovenox given his
hematuria )
CODE: full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Pt. will require VNA for nursing and home PT.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Schumachor is a 53-year-old , HIV
positive male with history of diverticulitis complicated by
colovesical fistula who underwent laparoscopic-assisted LAR with
takedown of fistula on 2/10/06 .  He developed an anastomotic
stricture and subsequently underwent dilation several times
without benefit. He presented for revision of his LAR
anastomosis and revision of his ileostomy due to prolapse.
OR COURSE: The patient had a redo LAR with very difficult
dissection and intraoperative placement of left ureteral stent
and redo ileostomy. Please see operative dictation report for
details.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. HIV.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Coronary artery disease status post MI , status post stent in
1999 and 2000.

7. IBS.
8. Hypertension.
9. Hyperlipidemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. A laparoscopic-assisted LAR and takedown of colovesical
fistula on 2/10/06
2. Exam under anesthesia and ablation of AIN on 8/4/2006 .
3. Excision of hemorrhoid on 7/1/2005 .
MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
2. Avandia 2 mg daily.
3. Vitamin D.
4. Vicodin p.r.n.
5. Lipitor 40 mg daily.
6. Lexiva 700 mg daily.
7. Norvir 100 mg daily.
8. Atenolol 12.5 mg daily.
9. Acyclovir 400 mg daily.
10. Truvada 200/300 mg every other day.
11. Glyburide 1.25 mg daily.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room as
described above. He was stabilized in the PACU and transferred
to the regular floor for a routine postoperative care. He was
given an epidural for pain control as well as IV Lopressor for
perioperative beta blockade while the patient was n.p.o. He was
given supplemental oxygen and was weaned as tolerated. The
patient was placed on the colectomy pathway postoperatively and
his NG tube was removed in the morning on postoperative day #1.
He was advanced to sips with no nausea or vomiting. He had a
Blake drain in his pelvis and that was left initially postop
until the output decreased. His Foley and left ureteral stent
were in place for two days and then his JP drain was sent for
creatinine analysis to look for a ureteral leak. This was found
to be negative for leak and his JP drain was subsequently
removed. The patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis and he was given Ancef and Flagyl x2 two doses
perioperatively as well as his home HIV meds.
The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative course and
was tolerating a house diet and had adequate ostomy output with
no nausea or vomiting by postop day #3. However , by
postoperative #5 , the patient&apos;s abdomen was more distended and he
had increasing nausea with any type of food by mouth. A KUB was
obtained at that time which was consistent with ileus. The
patient was switched back to clear liquids until his ostomy began
to function once again. He was given IV fluids for continued
hydration at that time. By postoperative day #7 , the patient&apos;s
ileus had resolved and he was passing gas and stool into his bag.
However , the output from his bag was greater than 1200 mL per
day. The Metamucil was added as well as Imodium to decrease the
output of his ostomy. By postop day #7 , in addition to his high
ostomy output , the patient had sinus tachycardia approximately
110 beats per minute. His Lopressor was increased to 20 mg q.4h.
for increased blood pressure control , and heart rate control. By
postoperative day #8 , his heart rate was 80s to 90s and blood
pressure was 120s/70s. His ostomy continued to put out greater
than 3 to 4 L over the course of next few days. During this
time , the patient was tolerating a regular diet with no nausea or
vomiting , but his stools were increasingly liquid and high
output. His fluid loss was supplemented with LR in a 1:1 fashion
to of avoid dehydration. By postoperative day #11 , the patient&apos;s
ostomy continued approximately 4 L and a tincture of opium was
begun as a the third line agent to decrease the ostomy output.
This decreased ostomy output to approximately 1 L and the patient
symptomatically was improving and feeling good. He was
tolerating a regular diet with no nausea and no vomiting. His
pain was well controlled on p.o. pain meds , and the patient
stated that he would be able to keep himself well hydrated on
discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. daily.
2. Truvada one tablet p.o. every other day.
3. Nexium 20 mg daily.
4. Lexiva 700 mg p.o. daily.
5. Imodium 2 mg p.o. q.6h.
6. Oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.3h. p.r.n. pain.
7. Metamucil two packets p.o. b.i.d.
8. Norvir 100 mg p.o. daily.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Good.
DISPOSITION: Discharged home with services.
Discharge.
INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to keep himself well
hydrated by continuing to drink water and beverages such as
electrolyte- containing sports drinks for continued hydration.
He is instructed to match his ostomy output in a 1:1 fashion with
liquids as described. He is instructed not to drive or operate
heavy machinery while taking narcotics. He is instructed to seek
immediate medical attention for fever greater than 101 degrees
Fahrenheit , increasing abdominal pain , or concerns regarding his
surgical site.

Discharge Date: 1/19/2001
DIAGNOSIS: Gangrenous left great toe
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Kommer is a 48 year old male with a
history of brittle diabetes and known history of peripheral
vascular disease , end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and a
long history of smoking , who initially presented with dry gangrene
of the distal aspect of his left great toe.
He underwent a first toe amputation on April , 2001 , and this was
complicated by poor healing requiring debridement twice during this
hospital stay. The wound was then irrigated and closed in the
Operating Room on March , 2001. However at his follow up visit
to the clinic , his wound was erythematous and appeared to be
questionably infected. Thus , the wound was opened and debrided on
the day prior to the current admission. The patient reported a
history of chills but no fever.
Mr. Cord now presents preoperatively for an operative debridement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes.
2. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis on Tuesday , Thursday
and Saturday.
3. Hypertension.
4. Peripheral vascular disease.
5. ETOH abuse.
6. Tobacco abuse.
7. Hepatitis C virus positive.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Enteric coated aspirin , 325 mg p.o.
q.d.; Atenolol , 50 mg p.o. q.d.; calcium acetate , 1334 mg p.o.
q.d.; Zestril , 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Prilosec , 20 mg p.o. q.d.;
insulin , 70-30 , 20 units subcutaneously q a.m. , 8 units
subcutaneously q p.m.; Norvasc , 10 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet prn
pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs. In general , he was a thin appearing , middle
aged Hispanic gentleman in no acute distress. His lungs were
clear. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI
systolic ejection murmur radiating to his neck. His abdomen was
soft , non-tender , non-distended. His extremities had no edema.
His pulse examination showed palpable bilateral femoral pulses and
dopplerable DP , PT and peroneal pulses bilaterally. On his left
great toe , there was an open wound with no purulent discharge and
minimal erythema in the surrounding skin.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 36 , BUN 17 , creatinine 3.8 and a glucose of 469. CBC -
9.4 , hematocrit 30.3 and platelet count of 460. INR of 1.2.
Of note , his angiogram showed that his left common iliac artery had
diffuse disease. His external iliac artery on the left had a 40%
proximal stenosis. His left SFA had proximal 50 to 60% stenosis
and mid-50% stenosis. His popliteal had 50% disease and his tibial
peroneal trunk on the left had moderate disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Vascular Service
and started on Vancomycin , Levofloxacin and Flagyl. His wound was
changed b.i.d. and he was prepared for an operative debridement of
his left great toe. His pulses continued to be dopplerable. Of
note , the patient had very difficult to control diabetes , being
admitted with sugars in the 400 to 500 range , requiring IV insulin
boluses.
On hospital day #3 , he was taken to the Operating Room for a
debridement of his left great toe amputation and an amputation of
his second toe with primary closure. This was done under ankle
block and was uncomplicated.
The patient had a postoperative course significant for his very
difficult to control diabetes with intermittent hypoglycemia to the
40s and hyperglycemia up to the 600s range. He did receive a
consult by the diabetes team who changed his regimen to 70-30
insulin , 22 units q a.m. , 8 units of NPH insulin at 10:00 p.m. and
four units of regular insulin q p.m. , one-half hour before his
supper. He was to be covered with a sliding scale four times a
day.
The patient did receive Vancomycin , Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the
majority of his hospital stay for a total of ten days. He was
afebrile and his white blood count remained in the 8.0 to 9.0
range.
Mr. Devore received his dialysis as per his usual schedule of
Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday.
The patient did have some intermittent diarrhea , for which C. diff
was sent and his cultures at this time are still pending with no
fecal leukocytes seen on his stool sample.
On postoperative day #5 , the patient did have a white blood count
up to the 10 , 000 to 11 , 000 range and on postoperative day 7 , there
was some slight , questionably purulent drainage from his incision
line , thus a couple of sutures were removed and his wound was
opened. There was no fluid collection or pus found in the deep
wound. The wound was dressed with wet to dry dressing changes
b.i.d. using normal saline and was directed specifically to not be
packed tightly but just to be wicked open.
His antibiotics were changed to Augmentin and Levofloxacin
impirically , as the patient&apos;s cultures from the wound drainage from
negative as of the time of discharge. He will also be continued on
Flagyl for impiric coverage of C. diff , in case his C. diff toxin
turns out positive. His antibiotics should continue for another
six days post-discharge and this will complete a 2.5 week course of
antibiotics for him.
The patient had no cardiac issues while in house. He was
hemodynamically stable.
Of note , his sugars did trough on postoperative day #9 to a low of
46 and he was reconsulted by the diabetes team with recommendations
to decrease his insulin; 70-30 in the morning to 18 units , instead
of 22 units. He will continue his NPH and regular insulin coverage
as previously recommended.
On discharge , the patient is afebrile with stable vital signs. His
lungs are clear. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen is
soft , non-tender , non-distended. His pulses are still dopplerable
bilaterally. His wound has no erythema and is packed open with
clean granulation tissue and some slight fibrinous exudate in the
wound. He has no distal edema.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
45 yo M with multiple cardiac risk factors ,
including known CAD s/p MI ( 10/12 with PCI to LAD , complicated by
instent thrombosis 1 week post-cath-&gt;successfully restented ) ,
HTN , dyslipidemia , obesity , and positive FHx
presents with acute onset of chest pain. The patient
has had several episodes/admissions for recurrent
c/p since then with caths consistently
demonstrating non-significant disease. Last cath in 3/8
showed R dominant system with 30% proximal LAD lesion.
ETT-MIBI in 1/23 ( 9:30 , 5.2 METS , HR 153 , BP 130/80 , was non-ischemic
but terminated 2/2 fatigue ) showed large fixed defect in
anterior , anteroseptal , anterolateral , inferior , LV
apex with EF of 35%. Seen 9/7 at GH for
syncope , dx with VT and had AICD
placed.
On this occasion
he noted sudden onset of 8/10 chest pain while
at rest at 6:30 pm on the evening of admission.
The pain was sharp/stabbing and was bilateral
with radiation to the L arm. He also had
diaphoresis , SOB , and nausea but denies vomitting , F/C ,
LH , dizziness. He took 1 TNG SL with some relief.
EMS transported to Greena Hospital where his vitals were 98.2 , 73 , 92/62 ,
15. Rec&apos;d IV TNG , heparin , MSO4 , ASA with pain down to 4/10.
Transfered to ITH .  A: 45 yo M with known CAD s/p MI in 10/12 ,
s/p recent ICD placement for syncope/VT at BMC ,
now with his angina at rest. Given non-oclusive
CAD on multiple recent caths ( including 2 mos ago
at EHC per patient ) , likelihood of ischemia now
is low.
P: CV: Ischemia-r/o MI , asa , toprol , heparin , plavix , zocor. Ruled out
by ensymes , ETT was non-ischemic. Pump-euvolemic , no h/o CHF
Rhythm-has AICD , on tele , replete lytes

Discharge Date: 5/26/2005
ATTENDING: QUINCY BRIDENBAUGH MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypoglycemia.
2. Altered mental status.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Volume overload likely secondary to CHF.
2. Possible pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for:
1. Bilateral occipital CVAs.
2. Diabetes , on insulin.
3. Hypertension.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Visual impair with tunnel vision.
7. Monoclonal gammopathy.
8. Bilateral occipital CVAs.
9. History of left upper extremity thrombophlebitis.
10. Microcytic anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman who was found at home with
altered mental status by home services and home nursing with
confusion. Her fingerstick was 37 , which increased to 42 with
orange juice with improvement of her mental status. Her insulin
regimen has been stable for quite some time. She had taken her
regular dose of Novolin 40 units on the morning of admission.
She was sent to the emergency department. She has noted
increasing bilateral lower extremity edema over one or two
months , increased dyspnea on exertion , nocturia. In the ED , her
ambulatory sat was 91% on room air. Glucose was still low and on
chest x-ray there was evidence of a right pleural effusion and
right lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis. She was given
Lasix , glucose , Levaquin , and blood cultures were drawn. She was
admitted for treatment of pneumonia.
She has an allergy to propoxyphene.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o q.d. in the morning , 40 mg p.o. q.d. in the
evening.
2. Atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
5. Multivitamins.
6. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Folate 100 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Iron gluconate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.
10. Novolin 34 to 40 units subcu. q.d.
11. Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Father died of an MI in his 70s , mother died of leukemia. No
history of hematologic disorders in her family. No history of
thalassemia that the patient knows of.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives in an assisted living facility and has extensive home
care services and lives alone. She was previously a nurse. She
has children who live nearby.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs: Temperature was 95.2 , blood pressure 111/69 , heart
rate 73 , sating 97% on room air. She was alert and oriented x3.
Speech and mentation were normal. No lymphadenopathy. 2/6
systolic murmur at the base radiating to across her precordium.
Distant heart sounds. Right lower lobe with decreased breath
sounds and decreased phrenitis , wheezing throughout her right
lung. Abdomen: Obese , soft , nondistended , nontender , benign.
Extremities: 2 to 3+ pitting edema bilateral and symmetric.
Neurologic: She was moving all extremities well. Left eye with
slight lateral deviation. Extraocular movements intact. Pupils
equally round and reactive to light. Evidence of an old
cataract.
ADMISSION DATA:
BNP of 1111 , creatinine was 2.4 which was below her baseline of
2.6 to 2.8 , white count was 6.6 with no left shift , hematocrit
was 35.7 which is up from her baseline of 27 to 33. MCV was 67.4
which is stable and it has been in this range and she was found
to have in 5/25 a monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP. EKG showed
an inferoseptal Q wave , poor R wave progression , low voltage left
axis deviation. Echo in 5/25 showed an EF of 50 to 55% with
moderate-to-severe MR and TR , septal hypokinesis and a MIBI at
that time showed no reversible ischemia. Chest x-ray as
describes above. UA negative for UTI.
IMPRESSION:
The patient was evaluated to be low likelihood for having
pneumonia. She was thought to more likely have volume overload
secondary to CHF. Because of her visual problems and declining
physical condition and deconditioning , patient&apos;s current living
situation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for her
increasing needs and error in self administration of medications
or increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may have
precipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID/Pulmonary: Right lower lobe pneumonia versus CHF , pleural
effusion. This was treated initially with levofloxacin although
it is unlikely consolidated lobar pneumonia because of the
patient&apos;s good clinical status , lack of fever and white count and
lack of toxicity. Sputum culture and gram stein were
unremarkable. Pleural effusion on the right decreased only
minimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and for
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent a
thoracentesis on 3/1/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellow
fluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with a
sterile transudative effusion. Gram stein was negative.
Cultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may be
repeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining of
the effusion. Urine legionella was negative.
Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine is at a baseline
of 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possibly
because of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her ACE
inhibitor.
Endocrinology: The patient was admitted with hypoglycemic
diabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and social
barriers. Her NPH dose was cut to 20 units subcu. q.d. with
lispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. which she needed only
minimally about 5 units a day and her sugars were well controlled
on this regimen which supports the hypothesis that her NPH dose
of 34 units a day was too high beyond a certain point.
Cardiac:
A. Pump: The patient with CHF , known valvular dysfunction ,
exhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea.
She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and it was noted that
her weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. She was
transitioned to p.o. Lasix after diuresing very well on this
regimen. She continued her Lipitor and aspirin , atenolol was
changed metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. Lisinopril was
switched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumping
creatinine while diuresing on the ACE inhibitor. She was
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 90s to
100s at one point and responded to a bolus of fluid , decrease in
the captopril and holding the Lasix , unclear etiology , looks
otherwise low. Lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and the
patient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked and
repleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday no
more than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is able
to maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime.
Heme: The patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosis
which might suggest thalassemia. She is on iron and Epogen with
an improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change in
her MCV , which suggests that she has more than renal disease
causing her microcytosis. Further workup of her monoclonal
gammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician.
Diabetic diet: Low sodium , low fat , low cholesterol.
Prophylaxis: Heparin and H2 blocker.
DISPOSITION:
The patient has been screened for admission to Jack Nor Medical Center Of where
she will go today. Her goal is intense physical therapy and
learning greater independence in her daily functioning. Her
pelvic films were negative for fracture. She should be ambulated
t.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
5. Multivitamins.
6. Aspirin325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Lisinopril should be held for the moment.
9. Iron gluconate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d.
10. NPH 20 units subcu. q.h.s.
11. Lispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
12. Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.
Ms Mengel should follow up with Dr. Rufener when she is able to
within the next week or two. Ellington is her primary care
physician , Jarrett Sandlan her PCP number is 653-609-3621. She
should b switched to Toprol as her blood pressure tolerates and
to lisinopril as her creatinine tolerates after low-level
diuresis of about 50 cc to one liter a day. Studies pending
include cytology and culture of pleural fluid and follow-up chest
x-ray on the day of her discharge. Lasix dose can be increased as
needed for better diuresis.

Hospital course:
CARDIAC: Mildly tachycardic in-house , going in and out of Atrial Flutter
and Atrial Fibrillation. Beta Blocker titrated to Toprol XL 200 mg BID
with satisfactory rate control. Nifedipine and Metolazone were
held in-house , given need for BP room for rate control. Her BP
remained well-controlled despite her being off of these meds. She was
otherwise asymptomatic. Patient was begun on Coumadin on discharge , with
INR to be followed by PCP and IGMC Coumadin clinic. TSH WNL. Echo also
unremarkable with EF 55-60%.
RENAL: ARF , likely progression of CKD with UTI contributory cause.
Initiated dialysis on 10/13 .  Repeat dialysis on 5/24 noted poor flow , was
referred to IR for fistulogram. Fistulogram revealed stenosis of graft ,
which was angioplastied with good flow. Nevertheless , pt had placement
of HD catheter on 11/3 as access to the graft was still difficult. She
has f/u with vascular surgery ( Tienda ) for possible graft correction
in near future. Pt continued on Lasix 200 mg BID , Cozaar and Vasotec ,
per renal. Sevelamer was increased to 1200 TID due to slight
hyperphosphatemia.
ALLERGY: Pt notes potential allergy to IV dye. She received prednisone
60 mg 12 hours and 2 hours prior to her fistulogram. She tolerated the
fistulogram well.
ID: E Coli UTI. Treating with Ciprofloxacin for 7 days.
ENDOCRINE: Continued insulin while in-house. Three episodes of early
morning hypoglycemia ( FS 30-50s ) were noted. Her evening NPH were
decreased while she was in-house. These episodes were asymptomatic ,
likely due to poor POs and repeated runs of NPO while she was in-house.
She is to resume her regular insulin regimen on discharge.
HEME: Begun on coumadin at discharge for new AFib. She will have her
labs drawn at her PCP&apos;s office. The WMH coumadin clinic ( 204 ) 273-3408
will follow her INRs , with target 2-3.
FEN: Renal diet+diabetic+low fat diet.
PPX: PPI , heparin 5000U BID , colace
CODE: FULL CODE
DISPO: Home with Home PT services
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please continue dialysis as instructed by your renal doctors.
2. Take coumadin 5 mg every night. See your PCP , Dr. Gofton on 10/19
at 4pm. Your PCP will draw your blood , check an &quot;INR&quot; and send it to the
DRH coumadin service. The coumadin service will then call you and tell
you to adjust your coumadin dose if necessary.
2. Your new medicines are: Toprol XL 200 mg twice a day , Sevelamer 1200
mg three times a day with meals , Ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice a day for 5
days. STOP Nifedipine and Metolazone until you see Dr. Hawelu .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Renal service at ETJMC will set up o/p dialysis - in the meantime , she
will get HD at HVH .
2. Coumadin: INR eventually to be drawn regularly at PCP&apos;s office. Please
call in the results to IH Coumadin Clinic at 107-568-5779 - they will
instruct the patient to vary her dose if needed to target INR 2-3.
3. GRAFT: Please see Dr. Pazik ( vascular surgery ) at GCH on 2/28 at
12:45pm for evaluation of possible revision of your graft.
4. VNA: Please draw initial INR on Monday while her eventual draws at PCP
office is being set up.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
An 86-year-old female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , coronary artery disease , hypertension , history of
recent CVA , presents with hypotension and shock , question of
sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient , as mentioned above an 86-year-old with history of
end-stage renal disease , insulin dependent diabetes , CAD status
post MI , bilateral above the knee amputations secondary to
peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular accident in 10/18 ,
who was initially admitted on 10/26/05 for nausea , vomiting , and
diaphoresis. Previously , the patient was admitted to Sourceshcate Naj. Hospital
for vertigo that was consistent with a right pontine lacunar
infarct , but despite being on Plavix and aspirin that was in
10/18 .  Her hospital course was complicated by an MI , and the
patient was medically managed. The patient was again admitted to
the Crny&apos;ssha Medical Center on 5/18/05 for hypotension and unresponsiveness
after dialysis. She had negative CT at that point. Since that
admission , she had been doing well until 10/26/05 when she had
nausea vomiting and diaphoresis following hemodialysis. She was
admitted to rule out cardiac cause versus infection. Her
hospital course was complicated by continued hypotension and
decreased temperature. In the emergency department , on
presentation , the patient had a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate
of 102. Her blood pressure was 83 to 122 over 40s to 60s. Her
respiratory rate was 16. She was sating 95% on room air. She
got 500 mg of levofloxacin and her Lopressor was held due to
hypotension , and she was admitted with concern for infectious
process. She was initially admitted to the floor where she was
found to be afebrile with the rate of 92 , respirations of 20 , and
blood pressure was 100/57. Her exam revealed bibasilar rales ,
left greater than the right. Her abdominal exam revealed
nontender and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
Her extremities revealed warm. She had bilateral below the knee
amputations. Her cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate and
rhythm with the 2/6 systolic murmur.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for chronic renal insufficiency , end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis , insulin-dependent diabetes , CVA ,
bilateral below the knee amputations , CAD , status post MI in
10/18 , hypertension , and peripheral vascular disease.
MEDICATIONS:
Folate 1 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , NPH , Isordil , lisinopril ,
Plavix 75 mg , Paxil 10 mg , Pravachol 20 mg , Neurontin , Protonix
40 mg , vitamin B12 100 mcg , and Nephrocaps.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives with her grandchildren. She does not smoke or drink.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Significant for sister with coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Neurologic exam: She is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA:
Significant for CK of 39 , MB of 2.3 , and troponin of 0.36. Her
white count was 8. Her hematocrit was 36.2 , and her platelets
were 298 , 000. Her INR was 1.3. Her EKG revealed a regular rate
and rhythm. Normal axis. T-wave inversions and flattenings in
the lateral leads on low voltage in the limb leads. Her chest
x-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and left effusion.
IMPRESSION:
An 86-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , presenting with episodes of nausea , vomiting , and
diaphoresis of unclear etiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient had a slight
troponin leak. It was unclear for initial presenting symptoms or
subsequent secondary to ischemia. On her second hospital day ,
she developed hypotension. Initially , her systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s and her blood pressure medicines were
held. Subsequently , her blood pressure dropped into the 70s and
she required dopamine and was transferred to the Cardiac Care
Unit. In the Cardiac Care Unit , she was started on the dopamine
drip of 10 mcg/kg/minute. In the Cardiac Care Unit , the initial
differential diagnoses were hypertension was cardiogenic versus
septic physiology. However , her white count revealed significant
elevation of 24.6 with bandemia , 10% bands. She also had an
elevated lactate of 9.3 concerning for GI etiology. Possibly gut
ischemia was the cause of her infection. She was covered broadly
with amp , vanc , levo , and Flagyl. She subsequently required the
addition of Neo-Synephrine as a second pressor agent to maintain
her blood pressure. Dopamine was weaned off. However , on the
second day in the CCU , on 9/26/05 , the patient developed sudden
hypotension. Physicians were called to see the patient and at
that time she was found to have no palpable pulse. Code was
initiated. The patient was found to be in pulseless electrical
activity. Chest compressions were initiated , and she was mask
ventilated , and she received multiple rounds of epinephrine and
atropine. She received 2 amps of bicarbonate and 1 amp of
calcium gluconate given concern for hyperkalemia in the setting
of end-stage renal disease. Anesthesia then arrived and the
patient was intubated. Despite all efforts , the patient&apos;s rhythm
deteriorated to asystole , and she was pronounced dead at 5:30
p.m. on 9/26/05 , which was the time of death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HYPERTENSION.
2 ) DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Wesley Malick is a 56 year old woman
with coronary artery disease , history
of unstable angina , and status post PTCA in September of l990
presenting with crescendo exertional angina. Cardiac risk factors
include positive for hypertension and diabetes , family history , and
elevated cholesterol. Negative for tobacco and negative for
previous myocardial infarction. The patient initially presented in
September of l988 with chest pain. She had an exercise tolerance
test at that time where she went nine minutes with non-diagnostic
changes. In April of l988 , she had an exercise tolerance test
with thallium. She went 7 minutes and 33 seconds stopping because
of shortness of breath with non-diagnostic changes and demonstrated
reperfusion defects. She was treated at that time with Diltiazem
and Enalapril. Patient did well until February of l990 when she
was admitted to the Uscven Medical Center with unstable
angina and electrocardiogram changes. An exercise tolerance test
at that time demonstrated six minute and twenty second duration
with blood pressure response of l46/86 and global greater than 2 mm
ST depressions. The patient went to Catheterization where she had
normal filling pressures. She was noted to have a 30% left
anterior descending lesion , a 90% Dl lesion , and a 40% OMBl lesion.
At that time , her ejection fraction was 43% and she was noted to
have inferior hypokinesis. Patient was treated at that time with a
PTCA. Her Dl was reduced from 90% to 20% without complications.
Patient has done well since that time until about five days prior
to admission when she noted increasing exertional angina while
walking up stairs that was relieved easily with one Nitroglycerin.
This continued to progress , always symptoms occurring with exertion
with several episodes of pain on the day of admission not
associated with shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting ,
or radiation. Patient said that her longest episode of pain was
approximately twenty minutes. This was because she did not have
her Nitroglycerin with her and was unable to take any medication.
Patient denies any history of rest pain. In addition , the patient
had some suggestion of difficulty sleeping at night requiring more
pillows. However , she denies that this is related to her
breathing. Patient has no history of medical non-compliance and
denies any constitutive symptoms such as fevers , chills , sweats ,
rash , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , or change in bowel habits.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Hypertension. 2 ) Diabetes , adult
onset. 3 ) Elevated cholesterol. 4 ) Carpal-tunnel syndrome. 5 )

depression that was upsloping in V4 through V6 without significant
change from March , l980.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to a monitored bed and was
ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial
CK enzymes of l76 , l33 , and ll5. There were no evident changes in
her serial EKG. Of note , however , her second EKG had lead
reversal. Patient did well after admission with no evident chest
pain. There was some concern on admission with the story of
difficulty sleeping at night raising the possibility of some
congestive heart failure. However , throughout the admission , the
patient showed no symptoms of this. Indeed , she slept well
throughout the nights without any difficulty breathing and there
was no evidence of congestive heart failure on her chest X-Ray. The
patient went for cardiac catheterization which demonstrated that
she had , in fact , reoccluded her Dl vessel to 95% stenosis and of
note , she also had her OMBl with a 50% lesion. However , it was
noted on catheterization that there was a small dissection proximal
on the Dl vessel providing a relative contraindication to reattempt
at PTCA. Therefore , this procedure was not attempted. It was felt
that the best approach for this patient would be to improve her
medical management at the present time and then at some future date
if necessary , to bring the patient back to catheterization with the
hope that an attempt at PTCA could be made later. The patient&apos;s
Lopressor was increased to 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. and her Isordil was
increased to 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient underwent exercise
tolerance test using the standard Bruce protocol and she went for
six minutes and four seconds stopping because of shortness of
breath denying any chest pain. However , she did have l.5 mm flat
ST depressions in leads II , III , and F and the lateral leads as
well as a l/2 mm ST elevation in aVL.
DISPOSITION: Patient was sent home on her current medical
management with the understanding that she should
report any changes in her symptomatology as well as should maintain
close follow-up with Dr. Maher . She will carry with her , at
all times , Nitroglycerin. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Ecotrin one
tablet p.o. q.d. 2 ) Insulin 60 units of NPH and 20 units of
Regular q.a.m. and 20 units of NPH and 6 units of Regular q.p.m. 3 )
Lovastatin 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. 4 ) Lopressor 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 )
Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. Her
disposition is to home with follow-up appointments within a week
with Dr. Malecki .

Discharge Date: 2/29/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old male
with a history of hypertension
admitted with acute anterior myocardial infarction and a very poor
historian. His cardiac risk factors include a history of cigarette
smoking , hypertension , family history , questionable history of
hypercholesterolemia and no history of diabetes. The patient is
followed by Dr. Zirker for hypertension. Approximately one year
ago , he was sitting on a bike awaiting an exercise test and he felt
lightheaded without any chest pain. He was admitted to ACH for
question of rule out myocardial infarction. He had an exercise
tolerance test one day later without chest pain or shortness of
breath. He exercises daily as well as jogging. Two weeks prior to
admission , the patient walked one block , he had acute shortness of
breath while awaiting for a train. He had a head cold with
congestion and cough at that time. He had no chest pain but did
have diaphoresis and mild nausea and vomiting as well as
lightheadedness and some palpitations lasting approximately one
hour in duration. On the day of admission after taking a shower in
the morning , he had increasing shortness of breath gradually at
rest with epigastric tightness without radiation but he did have
nausea , vomiting and diaphoresis. He was seen at Higheun Medical Center because he was &quot;unable to breathe&quot;. In the
emergency room he had a blood pressure of 207/150 with saturation
of 93% , rales and positive S4. He was treated with nitroglycerin ,
morphine , Lasix and Nitropaste. He was also given Lopressor , 15
mg. EKG showed Q&apos;s in V1-2 , 1-2 mm ST increasing in V1 , lateral T
wave inversions. Blood pressure dropped to 99/67 with treatment
and he was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , -15
degrees axis. There were left atrial
abnormalities. There was ST elevation of 1-2 mm in V1-3 , T wave
inversion in I , L , V4-6; Q&apos;s in V1 and V2. This was new compared
with prior EKG. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed pulmonary capillary wedge of 30 , RV 46/14 , PA 46/30 ,
ramus occluded 50%. The patient developed left arm pain with
inflation and slow flow after PTCA. The patient had decreased
blood pressure and heart rate and was treated with Narcan and
atropine. The patient was treated with nitroglycerin , heparin and
aspirin. He was also started on Lopressor. He was given IV Lasix
for diuresis and magnesium. The patient&apos;s third set CPK came back
at 429 with 10 MB&apos;s. The patient was stable overnight. His
electrophoresis came back negative. It was felt that an acute
myocardial infarction was less likely and it was felt that
pulmonary edema was secondary to his hypertensive disease being out
of control. His heparin was discontinued and he was switched to
atenolol and lisinopril. The patient underwent exercise tolerance
test where he completed a submaximal predischarge protocol without
pain or dyspnea. His resting EKG showed evidence of anterior
septal myocardial infarction with a peak heart rate of 120 , blood
pressure 180/90. There were some mild fixed defects anteriorly.
He also developed some dysuria after removal of the Foley with
100 , 000 enteric gram negative rods.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. MEDICATIONS: On discharge included
aspirin , one po q day; lisinopril , 20 mg po q day; atenolol , 100 mg
po q day; Bactrim DS , one po b.i.d. times seven days;
nitroglycerin , p.r.n.; Pyridium , 200 mg po t.i.d. times two days.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. Suydam .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 39-year-old Hispanic female
presented for an elective repair of an
incision ventral hernia. She developed the hernia at the upper
margin of a previous cesarean section incision in her third
postpartum month. Her only risk factor is obesity. She denied
wound infection , chronic cough , constipation or previous abdominal
hernias. She is not required to do heavy lifting in her activities
of daily living or her occupation. The hernia now causes pain but
has no associated symptoms of nausea , vomiting or obstendation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has suffered from chronic headaches
which have been investigated in the past; a CT scan and EEG are
reportedly normal according to the patient. She has been treated
for these symptomatically with the use of Naprosyn. OBSTETRICAL
HISTORY: She is gravida VIII , para VI , A II with two miscarriages
being spontaneous. She had a cesarean section with her last
delivery. She is also status post tubal ligation. MEDICATIONS: On
admission included Naprosyn , p.r.n. for headaches. ALLERGIES:
PENICILLIN WHICH CAUSES A RASH; COMPAZINE , DYSTONIC REACTION;
ANESTHESIA , IN THE PAST SHE BECAME BRADYCARDIC WITH SYMPTOMS OF
LOCAL PHLEBITIS FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF AN UNKNOWN ANESTHETEIC
AGENT. SOCIAL HISTORY: She has a very remote smoking history and
does not consume alcohol. She is currently involved with a weight
loss program at a nutrition center.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a pleasant , obese
Hispanic female was in no acute distress at
the time of exam. Her blood pressure was 130/88. Her temperature
was 98.6. Her pulse was 78 and regular. Respiratory rate was 20.
She weighed greater than 300 pounds. Her head and neck exam
revealed pupils that were equal and reactive to light and
accommodation. Fundoscopic examination was normal. She had normal
oral pharyngeal mucosa with no exudative lesions present. Her
thyroid was palpable at the isthmus only and was nontender. Her
breast examination revealed no masses or tenderness and no skin or
nipple changes. Chest expansion was decreased secondary to chest
wall obesity. Her air entry was symmetric bilaterally with no
adventitious lung sounds. Her heart sounds were normal with no
evidence of murmurs , rubs or clicks. Her abdomen was benign with
normal bowel sounds and no palpable masses. She had a midline
incisional scar from her previous cesarean section. At the upper
margin , there was a soft reducible hernia that measured 5 x 7 cm.
There was a palpable 1-2 cm defect in the fascia. She had no
evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal exam was guaiac negative.
Neurological exam was nonfocal with cranial nerves III-XII grossly
normal. Her sensory exam showed light touch and pinprick was
normal. Babinski&apos;s were downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission revealed a white blood cell count
of 7.9 with normal differential. Hematocrit was
31.1. SMA 20 showed normal electrolytes. Liver function tests
were all within normal limits with the exception of a mildly
elevated LDH at 199. Urinalysis was negative. Chest x-ray was
within normal limits. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats
per minute with normal intervals and normal axis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent repair of her ventral
hernia with mesh placement on 11/17/90 .  The
procedure was well tolerated with no intraoperative complications.
In the postoperative period , she had an exacerbation of ashtma that
responded well to inhaled albuterol nebulizer treatment. In
addition , she had a prolonged postoperative ileus and required IV
hydration until postoperative day number six. At that time , she
was able to tolerate both a clear and regular house diet and began
to pass flatus and bowel movements. The patient was discharged
home in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Colace , 100 mg po
b.i.d.; Tylenol , 650 mg po q four hours p.r.n. and hydrogen
peroxide to her incision on a p.r.n. basis. Her staples were left
in place. She will be seen in follow-up in the Geh/ Man Hospital within one week after discharge. She is to avoid any heavy
lifting for the next six week period.

Discharge Date: 4/18/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) STATUS POST TORSADE ARREST.
3 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Coronary artery bypass grafting times
three on 5/12/93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 72 year old man with a
history of myocardial infarction in
1979 and exertional angina times the last several months which was
well controlled on sublingual TNG until he experienced a twelve
hour episode of chest pain which was followed by exercise stress
test on 2/6/93 .  The patient , previous to his recent onset of
chest pain , had been very active with thirty to forty minutes of
exertion daily without chest discomfort. For the past five days
prior to admission , he noted progressive acceleration in his chest
pain symptoms which were occurring with minimal exertion. The
patient&apos;s local physician performed an exercise stress test and the
patient developed symptoms at seven minutes of walking with
associated ECG changes. Several hours after the stress test , he
had recurrent chest pain at home and took a total of twelve
sublingual TNG without relief. He presented to the Ings Hospital Emergency Room. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Medications
at home including Tenormin , Allopurinol , and Coated Aspirin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. Cardiac risk factors were
negative for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco , and
diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service where he appeared to rule in for
myocardial infarction. He was admitted to Dr. Vess
service and underwent cardiac catheterization on 2/25/93 .  This
revealed a 50% distal left main lesion , 100% mid left anterior
descending lesion , 70% mid left circumflex lesion , 70% D1 lesion ,
and 100% right coronary artery lesion. In the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory , the patient had an intraaortic balloon
pump secondary to ongoing chest pain and was referred to Dr. Bersaw
for coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient was taken to the
Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting on 5/12/93 .  At
that time , he underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass
grafting times four with grafts including vein grafts to the left
anterior descending , the D1 , OM1 , and proximal descending artery.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively , was
noted to be somewhat hypoxic. His post-operative chest film the
morning of post-operative day number one was notable for
opacification of the left hemithorax. The patient was taken back
to the Operating Room for evacuation of blood from the left chest
and at that time , small bleeding site was found from a sternal wire
on the left side. The patient returned to the Intensive Care Unit
and did well post-operatively being extubated post-operative day
number one. His initial post-operative course was notable for
atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100 range as well as some
intermittent hypotension. The patient was transferred back to the
Ies Hospital on Maryland for further management. On the day of
his transfer , however , while being treated for rapid atrial
fibrillation , he experienced a torsade arrest and a Code Blue was
called. The patient was blindly intubated and from this event , was
felt to have experienced an aspiration pneumonia. Patient was
successfully resuscitated and was extubated several days later at
which point he was transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical
Service. From that time on , he had a stable post-operative course
with intermittent slow atrial fibrillation which was well tolerated
by the patient. He continued to progress well and consideration
was made for need for transfer to a rehabilitation facility but the
patient made good progress with his cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
by the Physical Therapy Service and was safe for discharge to home
on post-operative day number thirteen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. ,
Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Tylenol #3 as needed
for pain , Atrovent two puffs q.i.d. as needed , and Enteric Coated
Aspirin one per day. He will follow-up with his local Cardiologist
in one to two weeks and with Dr. Beauchesne in six weeks.

Discharge Date: 4/1/2006
ATTENDING: JESCHON , SHANE M.D.
SERVICE: GMS PACE team.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
LIST OF DIAGNOSIS DURING ADMISSION:
1. CHF/dilated cardiomyopathy
2. Chronic headache.
3. Chronic abdominal pain.
4. Iron deficiency anemia.
5. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with a
past medical history significant for CHF exacerbations , dilated
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% , history of depression ,
bipolar disorder , and history of polysubstance abuse who
presented to Ami Ge County Hospital on 10/2/2006 ,
complaining of worsening shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
The patient had noted that she had increasing lower extremity
edema , decreased appetite and nausea; however , she had no weight
loss. Of note , the patient was recently admitted overnight on
3/3/2006 , with similar complaints. In the ED , the patient
complained of abdominal pain , which reportedly is chronic. Pain
is thought to be related to keloids at the sites of her open
cholecystectomy scar and hysterectomy scar. The patient had a
CAT scan of her abdomen done on her last admission on 6/2/06 ,
which showed diffuse micronodular opacities with wide ranging
differential diagnosis including infectious colitis , lymphoma , or
mastocytosis. A colonoscopy is recommended for further
evaluation. The patient was admitted to the hospital for control
of her shortness of breath , which was related to CHF exacerbation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for dilated cardiomyopathy ,
history of depression , bipolar disorder , polysubstance abuse , and
hepatitis C.
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , Elavil 100 mg
q.h.s. , Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d. , iron 325 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg

ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin and
erythromycin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently resides at home alone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for chronic headache and chronic
abdominal pain , as well as worsening shortness of breath as noted
above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile.
Heart rate 92 , blood pressure 154/91 , and respiratory rate 18.
O2 saturation was 100% on 2 liters and 96% on room air. The
patient was comfortable in no apparent distress. She is awake ,
alert , and oriented x3. The patient had an elevated JVD. Her
heart was regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. Chest
was positive for bibasilar crackles and wheezing throughout.
Abdomen was obese , soft , and nondistended. Diffuse tenderness ,
especially at cheloid site. Extremities , 2+ pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , creatinine 0.9 , BUN 21 and
hematocrit 36.1. BNP was greater than assay. EKG with normal
sinus rhythm with a rate of 80 , which showed biatrial
enlargement , LVH and a prolonged QT. This was unchanged from
prior EKGs. Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly with no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient&apos;s shortness of breath was
attributed to her CHF , and the patient was treated with Lasix 80
mg IV b.i.d. with a goal of greater than 1 liter negative per
day. The patient&apos;s weight was monitored daily. On admission , it
was 180.4 pounds and on discharge , it was 167 pounds. The
patient&apos;s creatinine was also closely monitored and it did bump
to 1.3 on 4/18/2006 , but then on discharge , it went back down to
1.1. The patient was discharged home on her usual home dose of
Lasix , which is 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient&apos;s ambulating O2
saturation was 99% on room air. The patient did have some
intermittent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She remained asymptomatic. Her electrolytes were repleted
aggressively and the patient&apos;s metoprolol was increased from 12.5
mg to 25 mg t.i.d. As a result , the patient was sent home on
Toprol 75 mg daily instead of her prior home dose of 50 mg daily.
The patient had cardiac enzymes checked because of her
intermittent episodes of NSVT. The patient&apos;s troponin was less
than assay. She was continued on aspirin , spironolactone ,
lisinopril , Imdur , Zocor , and Cozaar. The patient also has
outpatient appointments with cardiology in the CHF clinic.
2. GI: The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain and
a history of ischemic colitis. Pain during this admission was
similar to previous pain. On exam , the patient was diffusely
tender; however , it seemed to mostly be at the site of her
keloids. The patient was referred to have an outpatient
colonoscopy. The patient&apos;s primary care physician was notified
to arrange this procedure.
3. Neurology: The patient has a history of chronic daily
headaches and migraines , and she had a persistent headache during
this admit. She was treated with Tylenol , Reglan and warm
compresses p.r.n. , which did control her pain. The patient also
was continued on Elavil. A followup appointment in the headache
clinic was made with Dr. Fabello on 1/7/2000 .
4. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of drug seeking
behavior. No narcotics were prescribed for headaches during this
admission. She was continued on Klonopin 0.5 mg q.12h. and
Aricept 5 mg daily. New psychiatry followup appointment was
arranged prior to discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient had both microcytosis and
hypochromia by RBC indices , which were suggestive of iron
deficiency anemia. She was continued on her iron
supplementation.
6. Dermatology: The patient did complain of some right deltoid
pain. On exam , right deltoid was tender and erythematous;
however , it did improve without any treatment and on day of
discharge , it was only mildly tender with no erythema.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on Nexium and was
given Lovenox 40 mg daily for DVT prophylaxis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On discharge , the patient&apos;s vital signs
were stable. Her JVP was flat. Lungs were clear , and the
patient only had trace edema in her lower extremities. Weight on
discharge was 167 pounds. Oxygen saturation while ambulating
with 99% on room air.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was given a prescription for
her new increased dose of Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily. The patient
had physician home care set up for her where she will have CHF
monitoring and daily weights. The patient was instructed on a
1.5 liter fluid restriction at home and low-sodium diet. The
patient is to follow up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Cary Genco on 6/1/2006 , at 11:00 a.m , follow up with
Dr. Tillotson , psychiatry on 7/14/2006 , at 1:00 p.m. , Dr. Booker G Fracassa from cardiology on 1/26/2006 , at 9:00 a.m. and Dudley D Crout in CHF Clinic on 5/25/2006 , at 3:30 p.m. Lastly , the
patient is to follow up in the headache clinic with Dr. Durant

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV:
*Pump: Cont&apos;d ACE ( Lisinopril 40daily ) , utilized Lasix ( max Lasix dose
40IV bid ) to initiate diuresis. Orthopnea resolved after 3days of
diuresis. ECHO obtained on HD#4=nl LV size w/mild conc hypertrophy , and
severely reduced function ( EF15-20% ) and global hypokinesis. Mod RVE
and hypertrophy , and globally reduced function. Mild LAE , mod RAE.
Trace to mild MR , mod to severe TR , trace PR , and sm pericardial
effusion. The CHF service consult ( Dr. Busler ) obtained hx of 20oz
port wine consumption 3+days/wk. CHF team is attributing non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy to idiopathic vs ETOH. Rec&apos;d goal SBP&lt;120 ,
agreed w/diuresis , ACE , +/-adding ARB , and changing b-blocker back to
Atenolol.
CHF team advised there is was clear indication for anti-coagulation. F/u
appts made Houston Jackson Hugo K. Torain . Pt will have VNA-CHF
home services.
Admit wt=197.6lbs , d/c wt=185.5lbs.
*Isch: Hx of NSTEMI , pos MIBI , neg cardiac cath 11/3 .  Has a baseline
abnormal EKG that is concerning for inf/lat ischemia. Had a troponin
leak this admit in setting of CHF. Repeat CAD workup not pursued. Cont&apos;d
Aspirin , and B-blocker ( was initially on Metoprolol 25tid , then
transitioned back to Atenolol 50daily per CHF service recs ).
Tchol=119 , HDL=26 , LDL=77. Pt is DM , but no statin was started b/c of
elevated LFTs.
*Rhythm: Episode of NSVT 10/23 ( R-on-T VT in setting of QT prolongation
QTc=526 ). No additional ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on
via continuous telemetry monitoring. CHF service advised deferring AICD
placement unless pt fails 6mos of optimal medical CHF managment. Repeat
EKG&apos;s 10/13 QTc=495 , 5/9 QTc=478. Decision was made to cont Fluoxetine ,
given the minute risk that this med would contribute to QT prolongation.
2. GI:
*Team suspects hepatocongestion/GI venous congestion and/or gut ischemia
from poor arterial perfusion as cause of recent GI c/o&apos;s and LFTs. Low
grade abd pain and N/V resolved as team treated CHF , transaminases
remained ess unchanged.
PRN Reglan was continued. If GI symptoms return , pt may need additional
outpt workup ( HIDA scan , gastric emptying study ). Pt has an existing GI
appt to see Dr. Skwara in 11/13 .
*Cont&apos;d PPI for gastritis , duodenitis seen on EGD 10/25 .  It is unclear if
this can completely explain pt&apos;s Fe def anemia. She will need an outpt
colonoscopy to further eval.
*Celiac sprue studies were sent=pending at time of discharge.
3. ENDO: hx of DM-2 , HgA1c=8.8. Pt advised team that she prefer to
discontinue Glucophage in favor of starting insulin. During this admit DM
was managed w/bid NPH , pre-meal novolog , and AC/HS novolog scales. On
10/13 pt&apos;s total insulin requirement was 44units. FSBS 6/12 8am ) ,
271( 12pm ). Pt to transition to Lantus 35units qam to begin 7/25 .  VNA
arranged for insulin teaching and to assist PCP w/dose titration. Syringe
education was provided.
4. HEME:
*RBC: microcytic hypochromic fe deficient anemia. RI=2.19. Pt did not
save stool to perform stool guaiac testing. Cont&apos;d Ferrous Sulfate this
admit , added Colace and Senna for constipation prophy. Will likely need
outpt colonoscopy , team deferring this to PCP and Dr. Daso ( outpt GI ).
Hg-electrophoresis was sent=pending at time of discharge.
*Coags: mildly elevated PTT/INR this admit. Suspect nutritional
depletion of vit K +/- ?liver dysfunction from CHF/liver congestion
leading to mild auto-anticoagulation. INR improved as pt able to
tolerate POs. She was not treated w/Vit K.
5. MISC:
*Nutrition consulted for heart failure and DM diet teaching.
TH social worker was consulted to assist pt w/maintaining abstinence
upon discharge. Pt given instructions to f/u w/her outpt Jerrod J Whitehill at Insonmahunt , New York 40955
*Full code during this admission.

ATTENDING: BRICE ARMSON M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ON ADMISSION: This is a 73-year-old
female with known coronary artery disease , status post CABG , now
with CHF of 30% and a long history of second hand smoke
inhalation , who presented with shortness of breath. One week
prior to admission , she had had upper respiratory infection
symptoms and with some sick contacts. One day prior to
admission , the patient began with increased shortness of breath
over a 3 to 4-hour period while lying down. She came to the
emergency room where she was found to be wheezing. She did not
have any chest pressure or pain , but she did have some shortness
of breath and a cough productive of white sputum. She had no
wheezing , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and no change in her eating
habits. No missed medications. She denied any PND , DOE or
orthopnea , and she had not noticed increased leg edema. In the
emergency department , she was given Atrovent , prednisone , Lasix ,
albuterol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol as it was unknown at the
time whether or not this was a CHF exacerbation or a COPD
exacerbation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile at 97.5 with a pulse of
71 , blood pressure of 111/63 , and respiratory rate of 18 ,
saturating 98% on 2 liters. Physical examination was more
significant for a DVD at 10 cm. Heart exam was significant for
gallops being absent. No S3 or S4. Respiratory exam was
significant for some wheezes , but no rales however.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: A Chem 7 was significant for hyponitremia
at 132 and a hyperkalemia at 5.4. Her digoxin level was
therapeutic at 1.8. Total bilirubin was 1.8. A BNP was mildly
elevated at 189. First set of enzymes were cardiac enzymes to
rule out MI were negative.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: The patient&apos;s admission medications were
digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily ,
Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. , spironolactone 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg
daily , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Lasix.
ALLERGIES: Included Captopril , which gave her a cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lived with family. Denied any drinking and
smoking , but however did have significant second hand smoke
inhalation history by her husband having been a heavy smoker
during their many years of marriage.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease in
which she had an acute myocardial infarction in 1995 for which a
stent was placed in the LAD. She then had an instant V stenosis
and had then a two-vessel CABG , which was the SVG to the LAD , and
the SVG to the RCA. In 1997 , she had a SVG , LAD stent to
stenosis to then to VStent. In 1988 she had a third SVG LAD
stent placed and an ICD was placed for a low VF and presumably
arrhythmias. The cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , and smoke inhalation history.
She was admitted for shortness of breath , presumes likely
secondary to a CHF or reactive airway disease precipitated by an
upper respiratory tract infection.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient was cycled through
three sets of enzymes , which were all negative. The patient did
not have chest pressure or pain at any moment of her
hospitalization and did not need any nitroglycerin. There were
no EKG changes. She was continued on her statin , beta blocker ,
and ACE inhibitor , and aspirin. Cardiovascular pump. The
patient oscillated between the mildly fluid overloaded to
euvolemic. She was maintained on Lasix , and did well that way.
The patient received an echo on May , 2004 , which showed
normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with
overall systolic function being moderately in pair with ejection
fraction of 35%. There was severe hypokinesis and akinesis
involving the mid distal septum apex and distal inferior and
lateral walls , and there was also abnormal septal motion
consistent with intraventricular conduction delay. An ICP was
seen to be in place and the aortic valve was mildly calcified.
The left atrium was mildly enlarged. There was also moderate
tricuspid regurgitation with velocity of 2.9 m/second detecting
pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 33mmHg. It was determined
that since 7/26 there had been no significant interval change.
Rhythm: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm with an ICD
placed. There were no issues.
2. Pulmonary: Initially when the patient was admitted with her
significant coronary history , she was being treated like a CHF
exacerbation. However , despite her being relatively refractory
treatment it was decided to increase the treatments for a
possible COPD exacerbation. In this way , she was receiving
Duonebs and albuterol nebulizers 2-2 hours alternating and it was
decided to change her from p.o. prednisone to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m.
In addition , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin was added. Finally ,
azithromycin was added so as to possibly treat any atypical
pneumonia as the patient had only some interstitial pattern on
her chest x-ray , and did not have any focal area of
consolidation.
3. Endocrine: When the patient was admitted , she was maintained
on her home dose regimen for diabetes mellitus. However , when
being admitted she was given p.o. prednisone for COPD
exacerbation , and therefore , had uncontrolled blood sugars.
Because a finger stick blood glucose and insulin sliding scale
did not fully control her blood glucose. She at one point began
to have an non-gap metabolic acidosis. Anticipating possible
decay , she was started on regular lab draws and insulin drips.
Her gap promptly closed and the patient was , otherwise ,
asymptomatic. She did not have any potassium , fluid or other
complications. Throughout she was also receiving NPH insulin in
the a.m. and p.m.
The patient was discharged to follow with her primary care
physician , and the patient received at home VNA services.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications included
1. NPH insulin10 units in the a.m. and 4 units in the p.m.
2. Flovent , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin.
3. Zocor 40 mg daily.
4. Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d.
5. Digoxin 0.125 daily.
6. Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.
7. Azithromycin 25 mg daily.
8. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.
9. Combivent inhaler.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DEANGELO MACK PEED MD
Ms. Mulready is a 90+-year-old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease including a non ST elevation MI in 4/13
medically managed , congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 25% and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of
1.0 who was transferred from the Ime Tesion Hospital with shortness
of breath several days after discharge from that hospital where
she was treated for , a multilevel pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
She had been hospitalized at Ham11 Eghe Torsa Health where she was treated for
pneumonia and after treatment had returned to her rehabilitation
facility/skilled nursing facility where she was not eating and
was found to be very tachypneic and diaphoretic and tachycardiac
for the three days prior to admission here. The night prior to
admission , she had been readmitted to Nordi Medical Center where she
was found to have a worsening CHF exacerbation with symptomatic
bradycardia with heart rate in the 20s. The patient received
diuresis , had a chest MRA to rule out pulmonary embolism , which
was negative and was transferred to Redd Hospital
for telemetry. The bradycardia was thought to have been from a
recent increase in the patient&apos;s Toprol XL dose. On admission ,
the patient was afebrile. Temperature 96.5 , pulse in the 70s and
80s , pressure 140/80 , breathing a 100% on four liters. Exam
significant for an awake , alert , pleasant older women , very hard
of hearing , decreased breath sounds with rhonchi right greater
than left and decreased breath sounds in the right middle lobe ,
poor inspiratory effort. Exam also significant for a hard
systolic ejection murmur , crescendo decrescendo heard best at the
right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids , also
audible at the apex. Her JVP was at 12 cm. She had no lower
extremity edema. Her labs were significant for a creatinine of
2.7 , a slightly elevated dedimer at Hen Mekend Medical Center , a chest x-ray that
showed a right middle lobe pneumonia that was resolving ,
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: There was no evidence of acute ischemia. She
had a small elevation of her troponins in the morning after
admission thought secondary perhaps to CHF exacerbation or
chronic renal insufficiency. She was restarted on a very low
dose of Lopressor keeping atropine at her bedside in case of
symptomatic bradycardia. She did have a heart rate occasionally
in the 40s during this hospitalization , but was asymptomatic
throughout. In terms of her rhythm , in addition to the
asymptomatic bradycardia , she did have several runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. These diminished with
repletion of magnesium and again were asymptomatic. The
electrophysiology was consulted and they did not feel that any
intervention was indicated given the asymptomatic nature of her
arrhythmias. In terms of her congestive heart failure
exacerbation was thought to be the primary reason for her
tachypnea and dyspnea. She was diuresed gently given her aortic
stenosis and tolerated well a net fluid loss of 500 to a 1000 cc
per day with great increase in her comfort breathing. Notably
she never had an increased oxygen requirement even when
tachypneic. We will do a dry weight before her discharge and
send her out on a dose of Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a dry
weight to be followed at the skilled nursing facility. She will
also have a follow up appointment with Dr. Erin Bahadue at
Oer Healthcare .
2. Infectious disease: On chest x-ray , the patient has a
persistent right middle lobe process an on the second day of her
hospitalization had increasing tachypnea , was found to be fluid
overloaded and was gently diuresed as mentioned earlier. Because
a recurrence of her pneumonia cannot be ruled out , we will
complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl , which was
added for the concern of aspiration to add anaerobic coverage.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency. The
patient&apos;s creatinine has improved during her hospitalization and
is currently 2.0. We have replaced her magnesium and put her on
a small dose of daily K-Dur 10 mEq per day to compensate for her
Lasix diuresis.
4. Neuro: The patient was seen by the speech and swallow
service. Their recommendations were mechanical , soft , solid diet
with thin liquids , out of bed at all meals.
The patient will be discharged on Flagyl to finish a 14-day
course , levofloxacin to finish a 14-day course. The patient&apos;s
levofloxacin should be taken until 1/29/03 and the patient&apos;s
Flagyl should be taken until 8/30/03 .  The patient will also be
discharged on the salicylic acid 81 mg , Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. ,
Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin was given for prophylaxis as an
inpatient , but she should be treated according to MVCMC policies ,
lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
multivitamin , simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 10 mEq x1 p.o.
q.d. , and Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.
She will be discharged to the EH in good condition.
Thank you for the opportunity to care for this lovely patient.

Discharge Date: 2/9/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Coronary artery bypass graft.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old , morbidly
obese gentleman with multiple cardiac
risk factors transferred from Sherm Ilfami Medical Center after
presenting there with a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the
setting of chest pain , having ruled in for a myocardial infarction
with several subsequent VT/VF arrests. He has a history of insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,
and former tobacco use. He had multiple exercise tolerance tests
in 1993 which were highly predictive of ischemia with significant
EKG changes and symptoms in the recovery phase. He was put on
maximal medications , and his most recent exercise tolerance test in
4/06 was not as positive as previously , but still suggestive of
ischemia. The patient relates increasing exertional chest pain for
several months , and increasing antianginal medications required.
He had witnessed syncope at work , 911 was called , and he was found
to be in VF and defibrillated into asystole , which then converted
to atrial fibrillation. He did not require intubation. He was
taken to Wtazealt Imedet Medical Hospital , admitted , and ruled in for a
myocardial infarction. Despite some short term memory loss related
to the incident , he does recall having chest pain just prior to
syncope. On the night before transfer , he was resting comfortably ,
sitting at the side of the bed for the first time when he went into
VF on the monitor and loss consciousness. He was immediately
cardioverted to sinus rhythm and begun on lidocaine. He had
another episode of VT two hours later which deteriorated into VF ,
again requiring cardioversion sinus bradycardia. Lidocaine was
increased to 3 mg per hour and arrangements were made to transfer
to the Aand An Hospital .  On arrival , he denied chest
pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , orthopedic problems including severe shoulder
dislocations as a child with chronic shoulder osteoarthritis and a
recent meniscal tear of the knee.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Subcu insulin 70/30 50 q.a.m. , NPH 50 mg
q.p.m. , Corgard , Procardia XL , Mevacor ,
enteric coated aspirin , and TNG p.r.n.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology
service initially. He was seen in
catheterization and found to have a complex LAD stenosis that was
60% in the mid and 70% in the distal LAD , 40% proximal left
circumflex , 70% complex stenosis in the OM2 , and an occluded RCA.
His LV gram showed an ejection fraction of 40%-50% with
anteroapical akinesis. He had no further chest pain or ectopy on
the TNG , lidocaine , and beta blockers , and he was successfully
diuresed. Given these findings , he was taken to the Operating Room
on 1/26/96 , at which time he had a coronary artery bypass graft
with a LIMA to the LAD , and a saphenous vein graft to the OM1 and
to the PDA. He came off bypass and required atrial pacing and
renal dopamine. However , postoperatively , on transfer to the
Intensive Care Unit , he did not require any further pacing.
Dopamine was weaned successfully to renal dose and then to off.
The patient extubated without difficulty by postoperative day one
and he was started on Lopressor and enteric coated aspirin. He had
a high insulin requirement which , over the course of his stay , ran
up to over 100 units total per day. He was transferred to the
floor by postoperative day one. Because of his obesity , he
required a big boy bed and he was seen by physical therapy to
improve his mobilization. He was successfully weaned off oxygen
and was ambulating by the time of discharge without any trouble.
Because of his history of VF/VT , he was planned for EP studies and
these were negative. The patient&apos;s stay , however , was prolonged by
evidence of cellulitis , particularly of his right saphenous vein
graft site. There was no breakdown or discharge , however , there
was erythema and warmth , which was treated with IV antibiotics
( ultimately Ancef IV ) and elevation. The patient&apos;s white count
remained stable. He was never febrile. The redness was ultimately
decreased by the time of discharge , and he was sent home on p.o.
Keflex.
DISPOSITION: To home with services.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler two puffs four times a
day , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day , NPH 65 units q.a.m. and 45 units q.p.m. subcu , Mevacor 20 mg
twice a day , Lopressor 25 mg three times a day , Niferex 150 b.i.d. ,
Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
t.i.d. while on Percocet , and Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will have follow up with Dr. Rich N Mengsteab , primary medical doctor , for wound monitoring
and management of his sugars. He will have follow up with Dr.
Anton Litteral of cardiology and with Dr. Joaquin Weitman of cardiac
surgery.

ATTENDING: BOENISCH , RAUL MD
DEATH SUMMARY: The patient was a 69-year-old female with a
history of coronary disease status post prior myocardial
infarction and surgery in 2002 who presented to R.healt Medical Center Emergency Department on 5/10/05 with three days
of chest pain and shortness of breath. Of note she had been
noncompliant with prior regimens and treatments and despite
diuretics started three days by her primary care physician she
reported new shortness of breath and chest pain at rest. An EKG
in the emergency department revealed widespread ST depressions.
She was treated for pulmonary edema with IV nitroglycerin , Lasix ,
aspirin , heparin , beta-blockers , and then she was taken urgently
to the cath lab where coronary angiography revealed a left main
coronary artery thrombosis with proximal and distal stenoses of
about 70% , 50% of her LAD , and 60% of her first diagonal. The
patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after placement
of an intraaortic balloon pump for further management and
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
CHF , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , CAD , prior myocardial
infarction , restrictive lung disease , diabetes mellitus , chronic
renal insufficiency , morbid obesity , and iron deficiency anemia.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin , hydralazine , nitroglycerin , quinine , Norvasc , Lasix ,
Toprol , lisinopril , albuterol , and famotidine.
ALLERGIES:
She was allergic to erythromycin , Bactrim , and IV contrast.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Noted no fever , chills , sweats , coughs , abdominal pain , nausea ,
or vomiting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was morbidly obese with moderate respiratory distress lying
at about 30-degree angle. Her O2 saturation was 97% on 3L nasal
cannula. Temperature was 99 degrees , pulse was 80 and regular ,
BP was 140/50 , and respirations about 20. Mucous membranes were
moist and intact. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to
light. Her sclerae were anicteric. Her conjunctivae were pale.
She had a 15-cm of JVD with 2+ carotids without bruits. Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally with crackles two-thirds of the way up
the bases. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6
holosystolic murmur. Her abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and
nondistended. She had no clubbing , cyanosis , or palpable edema.
She has 1+ distal pulses noted.
Her EKG was normal sinus rhythm with ST depressions in the
inferolateral leads and a right bundle-branch block was present.
Her chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
consistent with edema. So the patient was admitted to the
coronary care unit and a consult with Cardiovascular Surgery and
serial crits were performed. The patient&apos;s condition continued
to deteriorate. She developed respiratory distress. Anesthesia
was called and her airway was secured via an emergent intubation.
The patient subsequently developed signs of abdominal pain and
presumed sepsis and ischemic bowel. She was brought to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Status post an
exploratory laparotomy the patient had a complex course in the
surgical ICU where she underwent multi-organ system dysfunction.
Her prognosis was very dire. This was explained to the family
and on 7/12/05 at 2:20 a.m. the family decided to withdraw care ,
which will be consistent with both the patient and family&apos;s
wishes and desires , and the patient was pronounced dead at 2:24
a.m. on 7/12/05 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Septic arthritis.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Rheumatoid arthritis.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male
with a history of rheumatoid arthritis , hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , interstitial lung disease , sinus bradycardia with pacer
who presents with 2 days of fever and diffuse joint swelling of
his MCP&apos;s , DIP&apos;s , knees , elbows , ankles , and especially his left
elbow. He reports that his fever was as high as 101 , and he has
been experiencing malaise over the past 2 days. He denies any
chest pain or shortness of breath. He denies diarrhea or
dysuria. He has no history of recent trauma.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Rheumatoid arthritis , treated with Enbrel and etodolac.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Interstitial lung disease.
4. Iron deficiency anemia.
5. Sinus bradycardia status post DDD pacer placement.
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 5 mg q.d. , Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d. ,
etodolac 400 mg b.i.d. , Enbrel , Serevent , risedronate 35 mg q.d. ,
Niferex 150 mg t.i.d. , folic acid 1 mg q.d. , Prevacid 30 mg q.d. ,
and Flomax 0.4 mg q.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM:
1. Infectious Disease: In the emergency department , the
patient&apos;s left elbow was tapped by the orthopedic service. The
fluid was sent for Gram stain and culture , and showed 92 , 000
white blood cells with 95% polys , and no crystals. Gram stain
and culture remained negative throughout the patient&apos;s hospital
stay. The infectious disease service was consulted as well as
the patient&apos;s outpatient rheumatologist. Given the patient&apos;s
clinical history and the high white cell count found in the joint
fluid , it was decided that he would be started on cefotaxime and
vancomycin. On 4/22/2003 , despite cultures still being
negative , it was decided to manage the patient conservatively ,
and he was taken to the operating room , where the joint was
irrigated , and the fluid was sent as well as a biopsy of the
joint tissue. Pathology severe mixed acute and chronic synovitis
with foreign body giant cell reaction. The cultures sent from
the operating room remained negative until the time of discharge.
A nasal swab looking for MRSA was sent and came back negative.
Based on these findings , it was decided that vancomycin will not
be necessary as an outpatient , and the patient was discharged on
IV ceftriaxone q.24h. for 4 weeks. By the time of discharge , he
had been afebrile for greater than 48 hours.
2. Rheumatology: Enbrel , which is a potent immunosuppressant ,
was held during this admission because of a suspicion for
infection. The patient was continued on NSAIDs for pain. The
rheumatology service followed the patient during his admission
throughout.
3. Cardiovascular: The electrophysiology service saw the
patient in the emergency department and interrogated his
pacemaker. They concluded that it was sensing correctly.
Following his joint washout , the patient did have an episode of
confusion , and his heart rate was found to be in the low 100s.
The EKG was difficult to interpret because of the patient&apos;s
pacer , and enzymes were sent , which later came back negative.
During his admission , a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at
the right sternal border , thought to be a flow murmur , but it
should be worked up as an outpatient if it persists. The patient
was treated with metoprolol during his admission for his
hypertension , and this was transitioned to atenolol , and he was
discharged on atenolol 50 mg q.d.
4. GI: The patient was treated with Nexium during his
admission , and was maintained on a cardiac diet.
5. Heme: The patient has been worked up as an outpatient for
significant anemia. The conclusion after bone marrow biopsy is
that he has profound iron deficiency anemia. He is currently on
3 times a day Niferex , and this was continued during his
admission. He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit under 30. His post-transfusion hematocrit
was only 32.
6. Pulmonary. The patient has a history of interstitial lung
disease and COPD. This was not active during this admission , and
he was continued on his Serevent and albuterol p.r.n.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to call if he
had any fever , pain not controlled with medication , nausea or
vomiting not controlled with medication , worsening elbow
stiffness or pain , or any concerns about his health. He was
instructed to go to the Gei Muirnea Medical Center office in Ha Pesey Radelp
at Arvlo every day for IV ceftriaxone infusion.
He was instructed to call Dr. Bogin in the orthopedics department
for an early followup appointment. He was also instructed to
schedule an early followup appointment with Dr. Rutt in
rheumatology.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Serevent Diskus 1 puff inhaled b.i.d.
2. Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.
3. Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Etodolac 300 mg p.o. b.i.d.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Hello Mr. Lockner , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you were diagnosed with heart failure and
atrial fibrillation. We helped you by getting rid of some excess fluid
from your lungs , and slowed your heart rate down. We also started you on
an antiarrhythmic ( amiodarone ) to try to convert you into sinus rhythm.
After discharge please continue taking your amiodarone. Also please
following these instructions: 1. ) Weigh yourself daily ( your current
weight is 200 pounds ). If you gain significant weight , especially within
one or two days ( e.g. &gt;3-5 pounds ) this may be fluid building up in your
lungs. Please call your doctor. 2. ) Please taking measures to stop
smoking. 3. ) Please check your blood sugar everyday in the morning before
breakfast and record these values for your doctor. 4. ) Please see an
opthalmologist within 1-2 months for a check-up. 5. ) Please take Lasix 80
mg twice a day. 6. ) Please continue taking ezetimibe and pravastatin for
your cholesterol control. 7. ) Please see your primary care doctor , your
renal doctor , and your heart doctor soon. 8. ) Please take 6 mg Coumadin a
night and get your INR checked at the Free Medical Center Coumadin clinic on 7/11/06 .
They will then instruct you to change your dose accordingly. Your goal
INR is 2-3.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Cardiology -- consider electric cardioversion in 4-6 weeks if still
not in sinus rhythm on amiodarone. Please check LFTs , PFTs , TFTs ( last
value 10/15/06 nl )
2. ) Primary care -- titrate hypoglycemics -- consider switching from
glyburide to glipizide given renal dyxfxn?
3. ) Coumadin -- goal INR 2-3 to be managed at SBMH coumadin clinic.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old woman
with ischemic cardiomyopathy who now
presents with fever , malaise , and rigors. In April of 1991 the
patient suffered an anterolateral myocardial infarction and was
treated with TPA. She had recurrent chest pain five days later and
was retreated with TPA without improvement and then underwent PTCA
of her left anterior descending artery. The left ventriculogram at
that time revealed an ejection fraction of 20%. This myocardial
infarction was complicated by pericardial tamponade and hypotension
treated with pericardiocentesis. She also subsequent to this had
suffered recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure and
ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram at this time revealed a
significantly decreased ejection fraction with a new left
ventricular aneurysm and moderate mitral regurgitation. She was
evaluated for cardiac transplant but opted for Amiodarone and
aneurysmectomy/AICD implantation. In February of 1991 a cardiac
catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 18%. The patient
was seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on 1/18/95 and complained of
chills and weakness and subsequent urinalysis was consistent with
urinary tract infection. She was started on Bactrim p.o. Since
then she has had increased nausea and vomiting with three episodes
of falling and imbalance. She denies dizziness , lightheadedness ,
palpitations , or chest pain. She denies fever or chills although
she had rigors in the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hypertension.
Increased cholesterol. Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post anterior myocardial infarction
complicated by ventricular tachycardia and congestive heart
failure. Left ventricular aneurysmectomy. AICD placement. Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. Status post cholecystectomy and
appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Cardene , Digoxin , Synthroid , Zocor ,
Captopril , Lasix , K-Dur , vitamin C , insulin , and
magnesium.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for brother who suffered a myocardial
infarction at the age of 50. She does not smoke
and does not drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well appearing woman in no apparent
distress. Temperature 101.2 , pulse 77 ,
blood pressure 102/52 , oxygen saturation 91% on room air. The
examination was notable for lungs that had faint bibasilar rales.
The heart examination showed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 and
S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border
radiating to the left lower sternal border. Abdomen: Soft and
nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. Back: No costovertebral angle
tenderness. Rectal: Guaiac negative. Extremities: No clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory data was unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure
and no infiltrates. The ECG was unchanged compared with previous
ECGs. The urinalysis was notable for too numerous to count WBCs.
The urine culture showed Escherichia coli.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on IV
antibiotics , specifically Ampicillin and
Gentamycin. She was gently hydrated. Over the next several days
she continued to improve although she still felt moderately weak.
Her urine cultures grew an organism which was sensitive to
Ampicillin and she was discharged on p.o. Ampicillin to follow-up
with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Clement Wittig , to document
resolution of her symptoms and to return to normal state of health.

A/P: 58 y/o female with hx of DVT and menorrhagia s/p hysterectomy
admitted for epistaxis and c/p.
1-Epistaxis: may be secondary to anti-coagulation vs underlying blood
dyscrasia vs allergic rhinitis vs recurrence of previous epistaxis
( possible AVM ) vs longstanding HTN vs tumor. Pt had another episode
of nosebleed/clot while an inpatient , but no uncontrollable bleeding.
There was no need to tamponade pt&apos;s nares , however , in light of her hx
of menorrhagia , previous DVT/PE , and family hx of DVT&apos;s , it will be
important to assess for different causes of hyper/hypocoagulability in
this pt as an outpt ( platelet d/o , von willebrand&apos;s disorder , hemophilia ,
osler-weber-rendu d/o ). It will be also important to assess for possible
nasal AVM or ?tumor( low likelihood ). Coumadin was continued as pt has
high risk of forming DVT&apos;s. Her BP was also controlled with
HCTZ/triamterene and captopril to help control bleeding. Pt&apos;s BP dropped
significantly in response to Lopressor and HR&apos;s were down in the 40&apos;s ,
thus her Lopressor was held. Patient needed captopril for high BP , thus
will D/C on lisinopril 2.5. She needs to be followed up for compliance and
understanding of importance of BP control , as patient was not compliant on
medications on presentation , had very high BP on presentation.
2-chest pain: ACS vs PE vs GERD vs panic attacks. As pt has several
cardiac risk factors , her CE&apos;s were cycled and she was ruled out for MI.
An Echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but EF was 65% ,
no effusions were found , and there was only mild MR. Pt does not have an
official DM dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk for
glucose intolerance , thus a HbA1C will need to be obtained as an
outpatient. Pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipid
profile was obtained. It will be important that she take her statins
regularly. The pt had palpable cords and calf tenderness ( L&gt;R ) , so LENI&apos;s
were obtained prior to d/c and these were negative for DVT , although it
was a poor study due to her size. Pt also has a hx of GERD , thus the c/p
may have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or GERD as it radiated to the back and
right shoulder. Pt denies having had spicy foods or nausea/vomiting before
the episodes , however. Pt had chest tenderness along the sternum and L
ribcage , which may have contributed to her feeling of c/p. Finally , pt
seems to have a hx of anxiety , per herself and her daughters and as she
felt she was going to die and felt stressed during the nosebleeding , this
could have caused her c/p. Patient had a adenosine MIBI prior to discharge
and this was negative for any ischemic changes , and she was discharged to
home to follow-up with her PCP for further medical management of cardiac
risk factors.
3-Fibromyalgia: pt was asymptomatic , but we continued her home regimen
and pain control.
4-FEN: IVF were avoided given high BP on admission and K and Mag were
repleted as needed. She should continue a low choles/fat , and no salt
added diet.
FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your blood pressure was very high on admission but was easily controlled
with blood pressure medication. This was probably due to not using your
blood pressure medications regularly. It is crucial that you take your
blood pressure medications regularly as prescribed as uncontrolled high
blood pressure can lead to heart disease , kidney disease , and eye
disease. You must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , low
fat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressure
or even lead to heart failure. You must also continue your coumadin
regularly as prescribed as you have a high risk of forming blood clots.
Please come to the ED if you have continued uncontrolled nose bleeds ,
severe uncontrollable headaches , fainting spells , chest pain , or
shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow-up HGBA1C , BP control , lipid panel , and chest pain with PCP as
an outpatient.
2. We recommend that the patient have a pharmacologic stress test as an
outpatient to evaluate for possible areas of potential cardiac ischemia.

Discharge Date: 4/18/1999
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70 year old female with a
history of coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , and peripheral vascular
disease who is status post a PTCA/stent of obtuse marginal 1 in
July of 1990 which restenosed and required rotablation and
restenting in January of 1998 who presents now with unstable angina.
The patient had increasing chest pain over the past month
progressing to pain at rest. The patient presented with substernal
chest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressure
of 230/90. The patient&apos;s blood pressure was controlled with IV
Lopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
5/18/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of left
circumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending artery
stenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percent
ostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostial
posterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction was
noted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percent
calculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary
artery bypass graft.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.
Congestive heart failure. Type II diabetes
mellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left lower extremity revascularization.

dorsalis pedis pulse and 1 plus posterior tibial pulse on right
lower extremity and 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse and 2 plus
posterior tibial pulse on left lower extremity with 1 plus edema
bilaterally. Neurologic: The patient was conscious and alert and
oriented times three with no deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , BUN 18 , creatinine
1.0 , glucose 205. WBC 12 , hematocrit 37 , INR
0.1. ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave
changes.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace , Axid 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
and insulin NPH 22 units q.a.m. and regular 10 units q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin- rash.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 8/17/99 the patient was brought to the
operating room and underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
After surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 the patient was
extubated without incident.
On postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the
150s. The patient was treated with IV Lopressor and Diltiazem drip
at 10 mg/hr. The patient subsequently converted spontaneously to
normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively the patient continued to
experience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from
160s to 190s. The patient was started back on Lopressor and
Captopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. The
patient was also started back on Amlodipine for further blood
pressure control. The patient continued to experience brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was followed by her cardiologist
postoperatively , Dr. Grunow . The patient was started on
anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient&apos;s atrial fibrillation
continued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time of
discharge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greater
than 24 hours. The patient was seen by physical therapy service
and it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.
The patient is scheduled to be discharged on postoperative day #8
to rehabilitation facility in stable condition with all wounds
clean and dry.

ATTENDING: BOYD ENOCH GROTELUESCHEN M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Dizziness , blurred vision.
LIST OF OTHER DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , coronary
artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and glaucoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 56-year-old man
with known coronary disease , congestive heart failure , and
diabetes mellitus , presenting with an episode of weakness and
blurry vision. The patient had a recent admission at Doyle Health Care Services 7/20/04 through 10/17/04 with malignant
hypertension and CHF. At that time , he had 3+ lower extremity
edema , a BNP of 1374 , and an ejection fraction of 20%. On echo ,
he was diuresed and lost 10 kg of fluid and was discharged to
follow up with the CHF Service. Since that time , he has been
maintained on 60 mg p.o. of Lasix , recently increased to 60 mg
b.i.d. , also with some recent increases in his Toprol XL and
amlodipine. The patient presented to the emergency department on
the day of admission with an episode of weakness and blurred
vision. He states that he was at work helping set up for a party
and he became somewhat week. His vision blurred and this
resolved when he sat down to rest. He reports having had one
similar episode approximately one month ago , for which he did not
seek medical care. He had no chest pain , no palpitations , no
shortness of breath , no fever or chills at home and in the days
prior to the episode had had good appetite and no complaints of
dysuria.
In the emergency department , his vitals were temperature 97.1 ,
pulse 70 , and blood pressure 147/68. The patient was
comfortable. An EKG revealed a question of ST changes and it was
noted that his creatinine was increased to 2.1 from his baseline
of 1.4 and then his blood glucose was 307. He was admitted in
order to rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
congestive heart failure , hypertension , cognitive deficits , and
glaucoma.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Amlodipine 7.5 mg ,
Timoptic 0.5 one drop OU q.d. , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Imdur 120 mg
q.d. , Zestril 50 mg q.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 60 mg
b.i.d. , glipizide XL 10 mg q.d. , and atorvastatin 40 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for the fact that the patient lives with
his mother and works at Ondo Carmi Medical Center Cafeteria.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for vitals as above.
The patient&apos;s jugular venous pulsations were visible at less than
10 cm. His heart was regular with S1 , S2 , S4 , and no murmurs.
His lungs had bibasilar crackles , right greater than left. His
abdomen was soft , nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. His
extremities were notable for no edema. Scattered excoriations
with quite long nails.
LABS AT ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 , blood glucose
of 307 , creatinine of 2.1 , white blood count of 7 , and hematocrit
of 42. BNP was 118. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 , left
atrial enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , and T-wave
inversions with ST changes in I , II , and V1 through V5. Chest
x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient ruled out for MI. He had no
complaints of chest pain at any time during his admission.
Initially , his Lasix and lisinopril were held in the context of
concern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episode
of weakness. However , these were restarted on the second
hospital day at slightly diminished doses compared to his
baseline.
2. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine improved and at the time of
discharge , it was back to his baseline of 1.5.
3. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s diabetes mellitus is very poorly
controlled. At present , his hemoglobin A1c measured at admission
was 11.4 indicating an average blood glucose level of greater
than 300. While in-house , he continued to receive his baseline
dose of glipizide XL , however , he was also covered with regular
insulin on a sliding scale. The patient has no prior history of
insulin use at home. After consideration of the risks and
benefits of other oral agents including the high nature of his
hemoglobin A1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would be
necessary for adequate control of his diabetes. Various concern
over the patient&apos;s ability to successfully manage insulin therapy
at home and so , a simply regimen was selected. To begin with , he
was discharged on standing dose of 6 units of NPH in the morning
and 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposable
insulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medication
himself , but simply to select the correct dose and give the
injection.
4. Neuro: The patient&apos;s episode of blurred vision did not
recur. It is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this.
He did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admission
that revealed no problems. He had no other neurologic or visual
symptoms during his stay in the hospital.
5. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was somewhat
hyperkalemic at admission with a potassium of 5.3. This resolved
with a single dose of Kayexalate and his potassium returned to
normal levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition on
6/19/04 .  To receive close followup , he will have visiting
nurses&apos; visits including two visits the day after discharge in
order to assist with insulin management and he has an appointment
with his primary care physician , Dr. Clifford Evanko , the day after
discharge on 5/6/04 .
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Timoptic 0.5% one drop
OU b.i.d. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d. ,
glipizide XL 10 mg p.o. q.d. , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH insulin 6 units subcutaneously
q.a.m. before breakfast and q.h.s.

***********
ASSESSMENT: 42F c multiple encounters with medical system for evaluation
of abdominal pain/ atypical cp admitted for workup of these issues.
1.GI: The differential diagnosis of the patient&apos;s abdominal
pain included PUD and enteritis/colitis. She was placed on BID
PPI and Maalox/Benadryl/Lidocaine for possible GERD pain. Narcotics
and anxiolytics were held for previous h/o narcotic seeking behavior ,
and the patient was agreeable. Her loose stools resolved , with no sample
available for stool culture , fecal leukocytes , fecal fat , C diff or
Guaiac. EGD showed normal gastric pouch and no evidence for ulcers or
other pathology that would explain her pain. She was discharged on her
home PPI.
2.CV: i- The patient has had extensive workup for atypical chest pain in
the past. She was ruled out for MI with neg cardiac biomarkers x 3 , and
was continued on her home beta blocker.
p- The patient had low blood pressures with SBP in the 80&apos;s on 7/18 ,
increased to 90&apos;s to 100&apos;s with fluids. Low blood pressure was possibly
due to fluid depletion from diarrhea and high atenolol dose. Atenolol
100 mg was converted to Lopressor 12.5 mg q6h with SBP in the 120&apos;s. She
will be discharged on atenolol 25 mg , to be titrated up by her PCP as
needed.
r- The patient had prolonged qtc of 509 ms ( slightly up from up from
480&apos;s in the past ) , with no obvious medications that would contribute.
No QT prolonging medications were given.
3. HEME: The patient has long standing anemia with baseline Hct in
mid-30&apos;s. Admission Hct was 42 , decreased to 34.9 with IV hydration and
remained stable ~35 thereafter. There was no evidence of GI bleed on EGD.
4.RHEUM: The patient has low back pain , with diffuse body pain and ESR
74. PMR is on the differential , and she will follow-up with Rheumatology
as an outpatient.

multivitamin , folate , calcium , Lispro sliding scale , NPH insulin ,
senna , Colace and oxycodone.
ALLERGIES: None.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband who is her
Healthcare Proxy.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 99.1 , heart rate
69 , blood pressure 149/77 with an oxygen saturation of 99% on
100% nonrebreather. Morbidly obese. HEENT examination is significant for fixed
left pupil secondary to surgery , with a pinpoint right pupil.
JVP cannot be assessed secondary to obesity. Pulmonary exam is
significant for diffuse rhonchi with wheezing. Cardiovascular
examination significant for a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
lower sternal border. Extremities reveal 2+ pitting edema with
2+ pulses.
LABORATORY STUDIES: On admission were significant for sodium of
149 , BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.3 , glucose of 21 , white count of 13 , hematocrit
of 34 , platelets of 63 , 000 , an alkaline phosphatase of 284 , ALT
of 82 , total bilirubin of 4.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 , albumin
of 2.5 and an INR of 2.1. CXR reveals a RLL pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Aspiration pneumonia. The patient was admitted with a right
lower lobe pneumonia. She grew MRSA in her sputum and was
treated with vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl. She did well
and was extubated on her first hospital day after arriving in the
MICU. However , she continued to aspirate and failed a bedside
swallow study in the MICU. She was stabilized and transported to
the medicine floor on overnight BiPAP. She again failed bedside
swallow evaluation with thin liquids , and was therefore started
on a very conservative pudding thick puree diet. She did
subsequently aspirate on secretions ( she was not eating at that
time ) and became acutely hypoxic with an ABG that showed a pH of
7.45 , pCO2 of 48 and a PO2 of 36. Her family was brought in and
it was explained that the patient was recurrently aspirating and
was critically ill. A family meeting was held , where it was
decided that the patient would be DNR/DNI , and every attempt
would be made to bring the patient home with hospice. She
actually stabilized from her acute event and was able to wean
from BiPAP to 3 L oxygen nasal cannula. Nevertheless , the
patient&apos;s family understood that her respiratory status remained
tenuous and that she would likely re-aspirate. She was
discharged home with hospice services per family request.
2. CHF. The patient diuresed greater than 26 liters during this
admission. Much of this diuresis was without pharmacological
intervention , although she did receive minimal Lasix support. At
the time of discharge , she was tending towards euvolemic or dry and was
not on any Lasix. She was felt to be in the polyuric phase of
ATN , which was resolving.
3. Diabetes. The patient was discharged on insulin NPH and a
sliding scale regular insulin. Her doses have been decreased
because she was found to be hypoglycemic on admission.
4. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. Given the patient&apos;s history
of bleeding ( she had a GI bleeding while in the MICU in the
setting of an INR of 2.0 ) , Coumadin was held. On review with the
medical team , it was felt that the risk of stroke was far
outweighed by the risk of a significant bleed. Therefore , the
patient is not discharged on Coumadin.
5. Acute renal failure. The patient was treated with
antibiotics prior to this admission , and developed ATN secondary
to that medication. Of note , her urine was positive for
eosinophils on admission. At the time of discharge , the
patient&apos;s creatinine was 2.1 , which in part was due to ATN and
also due to significant diuresis. Her baseline creatinine is 1.7
and she is currently trending downwards.
6. Thrombocytopenia. The patient is noted to have a chronic
thrombocytopenia. This was exacerbated with heparin products ,
which were discontinued. She did require platelet transfusions
for a platelet count of 34 in the setting of acute bright red
blood per rectum. However , her platelet count was stable at
greater than 125 on discharge.
7. LFT abnormalities. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was
within normal limits , although was of poor quality given the
patient&apos;s obese body habitus. She does have a possible
cholestatic picture , but the patient had no other symptoms.
Given her DNR/DNI status with hospice services pending , no
further workup was performed.
8. Agitation. The patient is , at baseline , mourning and
disoriented , but responsive. She did require Haldol and Ativan
p.r.n. , but also did well with 1 to 1 interaction. Morphine was
adequate for pain control.
9. Speech and swallow evaluation. The patient failed several
speech and swallow evaluations. She is put on a pudding thick
puree diet , but this is palliative , as she will very likely
aspirate even on this diet.
10. Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was continued on
prednisone 20 mg q.a.m.
DISCHARGE EXAMINATION: Temperature 96 , respiratory rate 22 ,
pulse 68 , blood pressure 130/60 , oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters. Exam is notable for morbid obesity , coarse breath
sounds , right greater than left , large ecchymosis of varying
stages particularly at subcutaneous injection sites , and baseline
disorientation , which is not different from the patient&apos;s usual
mental status.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON DISCHARGE: White count 11 , hematocrit 33 ,
platelets 214 , 000 , glucose 134 , sodium 148 , chloride 111 , BUN 40
and creatinine 2.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg q.2 h. p.r.n. ,
Pepcid 20 mg p.o. at bedtime , insulin NPH 4 units SC b.i.d. ,
insulin regular sliding scale , Ativan 2 to 4 mg p.o. q.6 h.
p.r.n. anxiety , metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , prednisone 20 mg
p.o. q.a.m. , morphine immediate release 15 to 30 mg p.o. q.3 h.

DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home in very poor
condition. She is discharged with hospice services for end of
life care.

protein/3+ glucose/trace ketones/trace
blood/negative leukocyte esterase/negative nitrates/3-6 white blood
cells/3-6 red blood cells/1+ bacteria/negative casts/1+ epis.
Sodium 135 , potassium 4 , chloride 97 , CO2 21 , BUN 29 , creatinine
1.6 , glucose 459. Acetest positive. White blood cell count 26.48 ,
hematocrit 41.3 , MCV 89.9 , platelets 278. White blood cell
differential with 81 polys , 13 bands , 4 lymphs , 2 monos. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 113 , axis equal to negative to 37 ,
intervals equal to 152/90/450 , as well as old Qs in V1 and V2 , left
anterior hemiblock , left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest x-ray
showed no infiltrate , no effusions , cardiomegaly , or pulmonary
edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient&apos;s glucose came down quickly with IV
insulin and aggressive hydration. She
unfortunately ruled in for myocardial infarction with peak CK on
4/13/99 of 285 , and peak troponin of 6.15 for which she was
treated with beta blockers , aspirin , and heparin , as well as
Zestril and Zocor. She had some recurrent episodes of chest pain
during her admission following her non-Q wave myocardial
infarction.
She also had an echocardiogram on 4/13/99 which showed an ejection
fraction of 45% , and hypokinesis in the middle and distal
intraventricular septum. She had 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and
preserved right heart function.
On 1/12/99 , she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% osteo left main lesion and a 40% tapered distal lesion. Her
left anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased up to 50% in
its mid portion. The first diagonal had a discrete 70% stenosis ,
and the second diagonal had a discrete 90% stenosis. The right
coronary artery had a 40% discrete proximal stenosis , the posterior
descending artery had a osteo 90% stenosis. The right circumflex
had an 80% proximal stenosis.
The patient had an exercise stress test on 10/4/99 which was a
modified Bruce. The patient completed a 9 minute test with a
maximum heart rate of 100 , which was 65% of predicted. Her maximum
blood pressure was 156/60. She was asymptomatic with no ST changes
and remained in sinus rhythm. The test was therefore interpreted
as negative for ischemia.
It was thought that the patient would probably benefit from CABG
procedure but it was deferred secondary to patient preference , as
well as her infection. With regard to her infectious disease
issues , the patient was treated with levofloxacin. Her white blood
cell count was persistently elevated. She had one urine culture
which appeared contaminated and her blood cultures were negative
for this admission. She had a pelvic and abdominal CT on 2/1/99
which demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , no evidence of
abscess , and punctate renal stones without evidence of obstructive
uropathy. Her fever resolved.
First it was thought that the patient did have a urinary tract
infection. She maintained relatively benign urinalysis , which was
collected only hours after she received ceftriaxone , it was
difficult to believe that she had ever had pyelonephritis. Because
of her persistently elevated white blood cell count was also
unclear although it did finally decline. In short , the series of
events that led up to her admission appeared likely to be urinary
tract infection leads to tachycardia and demand related myocardial
infarction , and then combination of infection and myocardial
infarction leads to nonhepatic hyperosmolar state. Nonetheless , a
different sequence of pathologies is also possible.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition.

OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. STATUS POST ATHERECTOMY COMPLICATED BY
REOCCLUSION AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59 year old female
with multiple cardiac risk factors who
presents with exertional chest discomfort and early positive ETT.
The patient has a history of cardiac risk factors of obesity ,
diabetes mellitus , and cholesterol. The patient describes a
6-month history of exertional angina described as chest heaviness
with mild shortness of breath whenever she walked more than one
block or climbed stairs. The patient is followed by Dr. Garrett H Lipkind , LMD at Skaemp Center .  She had an ETT on
5/23/92 , modified Bruce protocol , in which she went 2 minutes and 2
seconds , stopped secondary to typical anterior chest discomfort.
The heart rate was 135 , 83% predicted. EKG changes were
significant for 20 mm horizontal ST depressions in 1 , V4-5 , 1 mm ST
depressions in II , III and F. The patient was referred for cardiac
catheterization. The patient denies orthopnea , PND , and has mild
occasoinal hypertension. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , oral agent times six months. Asthma ,
no recent symptoms. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucotrol 7.5 mg
p.o. q-day , Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Isoril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Propranolol 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: ? ALLERGY TO UNRECALLED ANTIBIOTIC. FAMILY HISTORY:
Brother required CABG in his 50&apos;s , mother died of heart disease ,
age unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 140/70 , pulse 70. Neck:
negative JVD , 2+ carotids , without bruits.
Chest: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 and S2 , a I/IV systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right
sternal border. Abdomen: Plus bowel sounds , nontender.
Extremities: +2 femorals , no bruits , positive left DP , trace PT ,
right positive 2 DP and plus 2 PT.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN/creatinine 12/1.2 , glucose 318 ,
hematocrit 42.3 , white blood cell count
8.38 , cholesterol 222 , triglycerides 173.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent catheterization on 1/15/92 .
She had a proximal 95% LAD lesion and diagonal 1
40% stenosis. She had an anomalous posterior circumflex with
luminal irregularities. Her mean RA was 5 , and her mean capillary
wedge pressure was 11. Her cardiac output was 6.2 , wifh an FCR of
1226. The patient underwent athrectomy of her proximal LAD lesion
through a 10 French arterial sheath. The stenosis was reduced
from an 80% to 20% residual. The Heparin was shut off , and
sheaths were pulled later that afternoon. Her post atherectomy
course was complicated on the evening of 11/12/92 by the onset of
severe chest discomfort. The patient had significant flipped
T-waves in III and F and 2 mm ST depressions as well in III and F.
The patient was subsequently brought to the cath lab on 11/12/92
where the LAD was found to be 100% occluded and was dilated to a
30% residual with balloon PTCA. Thrombus was found at the prior
athrectomy site. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care
Unit after the PTCA which she proceeded to rule in for a myocardial
infarction with peak CPK&apos;s of 1390 with MB&apos;s of 55. The patient&apos;s
post PTCA course was complicated by several episodes of transient
chest discomfort which was relieved both by Mylanta and sublingual
TNG. These episodes were not compared with EKG nor felt to be
secondary to recurrent dyspepsia. The patient on 2/9/92 , seven
days post MI , had a modified Bruce ETT where she went 9 minutes
without any ischemic changes. The patient&apos;s blood sugars remained
elevated throughout her hospital course. She was maintained on
Glucotrol with NPH subcu q.a.m. was added with the hope that the
patient would eventually after the stress of her MI , her blood
sugars would return to prior levels. The patient was thus treated
with Mevacor for hypercholesterolemia. The patient was discharged
in good condition on 10/10/92 with followup with Dr. Kneisel in Frejames Ny&apos;smiss Hospital .

PICC-associated RUE DVT , enterococcus bacteremia , and gout flare. Had
episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath from time to time. This
AM , she complained of shortness of breath which has developed over the
last few days. She denies chest pain , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis.
Staff at Cet E Hospital rehab facility noted tachypnea , dyspnea so EMS was
called. O2 sat was 88%RA , BP 166/80 , HR 78 , RR 38. In the TH ED , she
was 85% on 3L nc and was put on NRB. She was eventually put on CPAP and
given lasix 120mg iv x1 , and nitro drip. O2 sat improved and was put back
on nasal canula and NTG drip was discontinued.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 57 year old woman with
cardiac risk factors with complaint of
substernal chest pain relieved by two sublingual nitroglycerins.
Cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco
use in the past , hypercholesterolemia , and early menopause with no
estrogen replacement. She was admitted on 11/10/95 with complaint
of chest pain at rest without associated symptoms. There was no
complaint of decreased exercise tolerance , exertional symptoms. No
PND , edema , nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis at this time. The
complaint at that time was 3 out of 10 chest pressure which
spontaneously resolved. It recurred intermittently without
associated symptoms , no EKG changes. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzymes and EKG. CKs were 156 , 135 , and
108. She was treated with aspirin , beta blockers , and
nitroglycerin. The concern was for a question of unequal blood
pressures in the patient and complaint of back pain. A GEE was
done to rule out aortic dissection. On GEE there were no valvular
abnormalities or evidence for dissection and no regional wall
motion abnormalities. ETT was done on 8/26/95 .  The patient
exercised for 4 minutes 13 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol.
She was stopped secondary to leg fatigue and dyspnea with a heart
rate of 84 - 113 with a target of 138. Blood pressure was 136/80
and elevated to 164/90. There were no EKG changes and no evidence
for ischemia on this study despite limited effort.
On the evening of admission on 7/25/95 she again had the acute
onset of sharp , burning , mid-epigastric versus sternal pain without
radiation and with associated shortness of breath , diaphoresis ,
nausea , and an acid taste. She took two sublingual nitroglycerins
with relief of symptoms. The pain lasted a total of 15 minutes.
She has been pain-free since arrival to the hospital.
MEDICATIONS: Glucotrol 20 mg q.d. , Cardizem CD , Benadryl 50 mg
t.i.d. , Provastatin 20 mg q.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide
12.5 mg q.d. , Trazadone 50 mg q.h.s. , aspirin 1 q.d. , Lopressor 75
mg q.d. , nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. , Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a receptionist. She has three children.
She has never married. She lives alone.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile with blood pressure of
132/96 , pulse 95. She was on one liter of
oxygen , saturation of 97%. Respiratory rate was 20. HEENT:
Normal. No JVD. Lungs were clear. Heart: PMI was nondisplaced.
Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs.
Abdomen: Soft but obese. Nontender , nondistended. No
hepatojugular reflux. No abdominal bruits. No pulsatile masses.
Extremities: Without edema , cords , or femoral bruits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for potassium of 3.7 , magnesium
1.9. Hematocrit 36 , WBC 11.5. CK first
set was 118. Triponin was 0.0. EKG was notable for normal sinus
rhythm with occasional PVCs. Intervals and axis were within normal
limits. There was a slight upper concavity and ST-T segment in V2
and V3 when compared to old although this could be consistent with
J point elevation and a question of a 0.5 mm segment elevation in
V2. The EKG was without change from previous admission.
IMPRESSION: This is a 57 year old woman with multiple cardiac risk
factors presenting with complaint of substernal ,
midepigastric pain , burning. Although she had multiple cardiac
risk factors , her pain is of an atypical quality and sounds more
consistent with a gastrointestinal source. The GEE was a
suboptimal study and it was deemed more appropriate on admission to
both rule the patient out but consider a pharmacologic stress test
before cathing this patient.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Since the patient&apos;s symptoms did sound more
gastrointestinal , she was started on Axid for
possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as provided
with Maalox and told to keep the head of the bed elevated. She was
continued on Glucotrol for diabetes mellitus and was instructed on
risk factor modifications , including diabetes mellitus control ,
controlling cholesterol and hypertension. She is currently a
non-smoker.
On the day following admission the patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzyme sets respectively. A set was 118;
B set was 105; C set was 105; D set was 100. EKGs were without
change. As well , the patient had remained symptom-free during the
hospital course and was scheduled for a Dobutamine MIBI for
6/23/95 .  The patient on Dobutamine MIBI study showed heart rate
going up from 70 to 101 , blood pressure 170/80 went up to 230/90.
There were no EKG changes and no chest pressure. MIBI images were
notable for a fixed mild reduced uptake in the inferior wall
consistent with but not diagnostic for myocardial injury. There
were no reversible perfusion abnormalities detected. As such the
patient was discharged home with a change in her medication
regimen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Ecasa 325 mg q.d. , Glucotrol 20 mg b.i.d. ,
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.d. , Provastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. FOLLOW-UP: The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. Jonker as an outpatient for
further workup and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
as well as following her for her cardiac disease via the risk
factor modification.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DEHAEMERS , WAYLON M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: Shortness of breath and failure to thrive.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Clostridium difficile colitis and
ischemic cardiomyopathy.
OTHER DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE: Congestive heart failure; coronary
artery disease; hypertension; atrial fibrillation; diabetes type
2; end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis; history of urinary
tract infections; and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: No operations or procedures were
done.
TREATMENTS: No treatments were done.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: In addition to what is noted below , he does
note increased fatigue. No fevers , chills , or night sweats. No
palpitations. No diaphoresis. No abdominal pain. Occasional
diarrhea with loss of bowel control. No nausea or vomiting. No
dysuria. No hematuria. No bright red blood per rectum.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and failure to thrive.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 73-year-old gentleman with
end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who was treated for C. difficile
colitis and worsening CHF. The patient has a long history of
ESRD secondary to hypertension and diabetes. He began
hemodialysis in January 2005. He also has a long history of
peripheral vascular disease status post right carotid
endarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as well
as atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA diagnosed by MRI with
the timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from his
atrial fibrillation. This gentleman presented with worsening
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worsening
dysphagia and anorexia on January , 2005. Apparently , he was in
good health or at least his usual state of health until April ,
2005 , when he was admitted to Aton Norran Rehabilitation Hospital Of for GU
symptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. He stayed
there for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitation
center. After being discharged there for 1 week , he developed
worsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the door
when his neighbor knocked. The neighbor brought him into the ED
on January , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which the
patient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. He
has gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now only
being able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressively
short of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. In fact , he
currently cannot even get through his HPI without 3- to 5-word
dyspnea. He denies any PND. Concerning for his dysphagia , he
feels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control his
volume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early January
2005. His goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake in
order to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.
About 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. He states that
this was because of the &quot;his renal diet.&quot; It was unclear if the
diet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite was
prior to the diet. Over the past 3 weeks , he has noted
progressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. He is able to
swallow liquids. Since discharge from rehabilitation a week
prior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. He quotes
he cannot even take noodles and soup. He has no nausea or
vomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominal
pain. His throat is sore and dry. He constantly wants water and
ice. Also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-
to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. In the ED ,
he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;
respirations 18; and 97% on room air. He was given Lopressor for
rate control for his atrial fibrillation. His EKG showed new T
wave inversions in the inferolateral leads and Q waves , which
were new for his baseline in the inferior leads. There was also
an S1 , Q3 , T3 , which was new but absent once his rate was
controlled.
The patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred to
the unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to have
right subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in the
left arm. His blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.
He was then transferred back to the floor. An abdominal CT was
done on September , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonic
wall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to the
rectum. The differential diagnosis at this time was
pseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. His lactate
level was normal. He had a benign examination , and because of
the distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that he
most likely had C. difficile , which was found to be culture
positive on August , 2005. He had an echocardiogram , which
revealed an EF of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesis
as compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital in
January 2005 with an EF of 30% to 35%. He had severe TR. On July , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernal
chest pain. Enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. An EKG
showed ST depressions in V2 through V6 , which resolved with rate
control. He received aspirin and heparin and continued his
Lopressor and statin. The decision was made not to catheterize ,
as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel disease
and not a surgical candidate. The patient made the decision with
the cardiologist , family , and the team. The patient was
scheduled for an EGD and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia and
colitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of the
non-ST-elevation MI on January , 2005. Subsequently , the patient
was managed medically for his worsening CHF and shortness of
breath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays ,
and Saturdays. The patient began Flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. on
January , 2005 , which should be continued through August ,
2005 , for a full 14-day course.
IMPRESSION: This is a 73-year-old man with acute worsening
shortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weight
loss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past
2 months. He was found to have Clostridium difficile colitis and
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. His
course was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
on January , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likely
demand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failure
setting. His EGD and colonscopy was postponed secondary to the
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was managed
medically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestive
heart failure. He continues Flagyl p.o. for Clostridium
difficile treatment. He was transferred on July , 2005 , to a
rehabilitation facility.
PROBLEMS BY SYSTEMS:
1. Gastrointestinal: We are treating his C. difficile colitis
with p.o. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from January , 2005 , through
July , 2005. His stool did grow out Staphylococcus aureus ,
but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , and
therefore , we are not treating. Per ID consult , we are holding
all other antibiotics and treating only when cultures are
positive. He had a planned EGD and colonscopy , which was
postponed due to the NSTEMI on January , 2005. He should have a
scope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the road
once the patient is stable. His LFTs were noted to bump on
July , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likely
secondary to either shock liver or just his NSTEMI. Continue to
monitor them at rehabilitation. The patient is unable to swallow
solids and is currently on a full liquid diet. After EGD ,
consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. The patient refuses NG
tube , so encourage p.o. intake. He will take Nepro if asked. He
should have at least 100 cc of Nepro a day.
2. Cardiovascular: CHF with an EF of 10% to 15% with global
hypokinesis compared to January 2005 EF of 30% to 35%. He has
severe MR and TR. He is on Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril
12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. He was started
on digoxin 0.25 three days a week on Sunday , Wednesday , and
Friday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on July , 2005.
He was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken off
between 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. He had an
NSTEMI on January , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demand
ischemia from CHF. Continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.
We discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. A decision was made
not to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to have
three-vessel disease. EKG currently shows Q waves inferiorly
with ST depressions in V3 through V4 and T wave inversions in V3
through V6. The depressions improved with rate control. He does
have a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which is
false due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check blood
pressures in the left arm. He has atrial fibrillation and he
used to be on diltiazem for rate control. He was on Lopressor
with good effect. He was restarted on his Coumadin dose at 4 mg
q.h.s. on July , 2005 , for anticoagulation. He is on
telemetry. He should be monitored of his INR for a goal INR of 2
to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of Coumadin as
accordingly.
3. Endocrine: Now on half-strength NovoLog sliding scale. He
has had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.
His fingersticks can go up to 250. We think this is okay not to
cover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.
4. Pulmonary: On admission , he had acute shortness of breath
and tachycardia. An EKG showed S1 , Q3 , T3. PE CT was negative.
There was no parenchymal disease. Some hilar lymph nodes were
noted. His repeated chest x-rays were every other day , which
only showed changes in the CHF status. There was routinely no
consolidation or interstitial disease seen. His last chest x-ray
showed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on July , 2005.
5. Infectious Disease: We are only doing Flagyl p.o. for C.
difficile treatment. He should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.
through August , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. We
questioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to
96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growth
to date. You could consider a third generation cephalosporin if
a pneumonia develops.
6. Renal: Hemodialysis on Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday.
7. Hematology: He has anemia. Panel workup with mixed picture
of iron and chronic anemia. We are repleting his iron with
vitamin C. He received 1 unit on October , 2005 , at
hemodialysis. His current hematocrit is 31. Guaiac stools have
been negative.
8. He has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.
He has a normal TSH , PSA , and free PSA. No mass is seen on
abdominal CT or chest CT.
9. Prophylaxis: He is on heparin subcutaneously and Nexium.
10. Disposition: He is going to rehabilitation today on February , 2005.
11. Code status: DNR/DNI.
12. Health care proxy: His brother , Son Gonzaliz ,
167-227-0450.
PLAN TO DO:
1. Hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.

before being presented to the emergency department. He also
described a decrease in his urine output one day prior to
admission and dysuria x2 days. The patient denied any nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain or pressure. No palpitations , and
no dyspnea on exertion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

failure , and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , prednisone 20 mg daily ,
valacyclovir 400 mg daily , calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily , metoprolol
25 mg b.i.d. , Bactrim single strength daily , NPH 16 units q.a.m. ,

Nexium 20 mg daily , Colace 100 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily ,
multivitamin , and tramadol 50 mg q.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
He reports no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 97.7 , his heart rate was 93-97 , his
respiratory rate was in the 30s , his blood pressure was 167/90 ,
and his O2 saturation was 97-99% on 2 liters. In general , he was
in fairly significant distress. He had difficulty catching his
breath. His head and neck exam is significant for equal , round
and reactive pupils. No cervical lymphedema , and no icterus.
His JVP was up to about 12 cm. He did not have any carotid
bruits. His cardiovascular exam was significant for rate and
rhythm that were regular at 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and
heard best in the right upper sternal border. He did not have S3
or S4. His chest incision was clean , dry and intact. His
pulmonary exam was significant for crackles bilaterally about a
halfway up his back. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended , with positive bowel sounds. Incision of the
abdomen was similarly clean , dry and intact. His extremities
were significant for 3-4+ lower extremity edema , significant
pitting to the thighs , and some dependent decubitus edema as
well. He had 2+ pitting edema in his left upper extremity. He
had a fistula on his right arm. He has a decubitus sacral ulcer
with a VAC dressing in place on admission. Neurologic exam was
significant for alert and oriented x3. His cranial nerves were
all intact. He had no focal deficits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Status post CABG and AVR. On
admission , we held the patient&apos;s anticoagulation for a possible
biopsy of his kidney. We continued his Lopressor at b.i.d.
dosing. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction. He
had four-beat runs of NSVT on the day of admission , which he did
not repeat after repletion of his electrolytes. He had chest
pain again on hospital day #3 overnight. He did not have any EKG
changes with his chest. He was given Lopressor x1 , he ruled out
once again. The pain that he had developed was thought to be
likely incisional and not cardiac. Pulmonary exam: The patient
developed acute worsening of pulmonary status while in the
observation area at the emergency department on admission on
hospital day #1. He had an increasing O2 requirement , worsening
pulmonary exam , and a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema.
He was not diuresing effectively with more than 360 mg with IV
Lasix , which was administered to him in the emergency department ,
so Renal was called urgently to see him in observation and he was
sent for urgent dialysis. At dialysis , they removed greater than
4 liters of fluid and the patient was patient was symptomatically
improved. He did continue to have lower extremity edema
post-dialysis and an oxygen requirement of 2 liters nasal cannula
to maintain his oxygen saturation. He was given IV Lasix 80 mg
x1 on hospital day #4 with excellent urine output. His lower
extremity edema improved significantly after hospital day #4.
2. Renal: On admission , the patient&apos;s creatinine was 5.3. It
peaked at 6.6 and trended down to 5.1 with clear signs of
improvement. On admission , there was no improvement in his urine
output with large doses of IV Lasix , however , and Renal was
consulted to clarify whether this was an acute rejection versus
ATN from toxic doses of cyclosporin. In the emergency
department , he was given one dose of Solu-Medrol 500 mg , however ,
he was found to have elevated cyclosporin levels at 679 , so this
was thought to be the likely cause of his acute renal failure and
his cyclosporin was temporarily held. Since that time , on his
hospital day #1 , his cyclosporin levels trended down to the point
at which there were just slightly over 100 on hospital day #3 and
cyclosporin was reinitiated at lower doses. He was dialyzed on
admission with removal of 4 liters of fluid , CVM , BK , and LDH
were sent from dialysis. His creatinine improved , so further
dialysis and biopsy were deemed unnecessary.
3. ID status: The patient presented with UTI on admission.
This was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg x1 and then 250 mg
q.48h. for a course of seven days. Blood cultures grew 4/4
Gram-negative rods , and the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis.
After dialysis , the patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g
daily and continued on levofloxacin 250 mg q.4-8h. Transplant
and Infectious Disease was consulted who recommended ceftriaxone
be discontinued and the levofloxacin to be continued for two
weeks after discharge with repeat cultures. HSV swap from sacral
wound was sent. These repeat cultures and HSV swab were all
negative , and levofloxacin was continued for two weeks
postdischarge.
4. FEN: We held the patient&apos;s fluids. We checked his I&apos;s and
O&apos;s on a daily basis with daily weights. His hyperkalemia on
admission was 6.1 , resolved with Kayexalate , insulin and D50
meds. He was given additional Kayexalate when he came up to the
floor and his K resolved , backed down to his normal range. The
patient was kept on a renal and cardiac diet. His albumin and
total protein were low , so a nutritional consult was called ,
which optimized his nutritional status.
5. Endocrine: The patient had a tight glycemic control on NPH
16 units q.a.m. and 19 units q.p.m. , NovoLog 6 units q.a.c. with
sliding scale , and the patient&apos;s sacral decubitus ulcer had a VAC
dressing in place on admission. Plastics was called to address
his VAC. They took down the VAC due to some leakage on admission
and he was treated with 1/4 Dakin&apos;s solution and wet-to-dry
dressing t.i.d. On discharge , he continued on the wet-to-dry
dressings. He will be followed as an outpatient VNA , and will
have the VAC replaced by the VNA as an outpatient. His
hematocrit was stable throughout his hospital stay.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Nexium throughout his
hospital stay and we held his anticoagulation for possible
biopsy. He will resume his outpatient anticoagulation and INR
checks with his INR Follow-Up Clinic. He was able to leave the
floor for cigarettes , and he signed an agreement suggesting that
he was going to tolerate the risk of leaving the floor for short
period of time even while on telemetry.
On discharge , his medications included calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.
daily , Colace 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin 16 units q.a.m. , 18
units q.p.m. , ketoconazole 200 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. ,
prednisone 20 mg q.a.c. , cyclosporin 125 mg b.i.d. , tramadol 50
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , Bactrim single strength one tablet
p.o. daily , CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , valacyclovir 500 mg daily ,
levofloxacin 250 p.o. every other day x2 weeks , NovoLog 6 units
q.a.c. , Neoral 125 mg b.i.d. , and aspirin 325 mg daily.
The patient was discharged to home in stale condition.

Discharge Date: 3/13/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. HYPERTENSION.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
3. NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS , DIET CONTROLLED.
4. NASAL POLYPS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Ulses is a 74-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post a myocardial infarction in September 1995. At that
time , he had a peak CK of 6 , 700 and an MB fraction of 199. His
infarction was treated with TPA at Netla Ainor Center .  In January
1995 , he was admitted to Cerri Medical Center with
substernal chest pain. A catheterization , at that time , showed
100% left circumflex. He had an angioplasty to 20% residual , which
was complicated by a small dissection. He had an LV gram with
inferior hypokinesis , and he also had an 80% OM1 lesion that was
angioplastied to 30% residual. His ejection fraction was 53%. He
has been subsequently followed as an outpatient without recurrence
of his anginal symptoms. Approximately six weeks prior to
admission , his Vasotec was changed to Cozaar and his Niacin was
changed to Pravachol. At that time , he began having some
intermittent substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion.
Two weeks prior to admission , he was admitted to an outside
hospital with a complaint of chest pain. He is without current
myocardial infarction. He had an exercise tolerance test and was
then discharged. The results of the exercise tolerance test were
not available at the time of admission here. There was a question
of an irregular heartbeat during his exercise and he stopped the
procedure secondary to fatigue. The patient stopped his own
Pravachol and he changed from Cozaar to Vasotec 10 mg q.day , at
that time. As mentioned above , the patient has had increased
frequency of substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion
over the last six weeks. At 2 a.m. on the day of admission , the
patient experienced a substernal chest pain as a dull ache without
radiation. He had no other associated symptoms. He does not
associate the pain with any particular level of exertion , that it
can happen sitting still or with activity without any particular
pattern. With today&apos;s episode , he had climbed two flights of
stairs and then developed this chest pain which lasted for 10-15
minutes. It was not relieved with rest or after one to two tabs of
sublingual nitroglycerin. By the time he arrived at the Emergency
Department , his chest pain was gone. In the Emergency Department ,
his systolic blood pressure was noted to be 230 and he was treated
with nifedipine times one and IV nitroglycerin which brought his
blood pressure down to 140/90 and he was admitted for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , as above.
Hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus times five years , diet controlled , and nasal polyps.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol
5 mg p.o. q.day.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Toprol.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of coronary artery disease at age
48. His mother died of congestive heart failure
at age 80.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has been retired since his 60s. He is a former
warehouse owner and shipping business owner. He
occasionally will bicycle eight miles at a time or be able to walk
six miles at a time two to three times a work. He has not done
this since this summer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was in no acute distress , no chest pain.
His temperature was 97.1 , blood pressure
140/70 , pulse 68 , saturation 96% on room air , and respiratory rate
14. HEENT examination revealed extraocular muscles were intact.
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation.
Oropharynx was clear. Neck revealed no JVD , no bruits. Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination was
bradycardic , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with positive bowel
sounds , no organomegaly. Rectal examination was guaiac negative
per Emergency Department. Extremities had no cyanosis , clubbing ,
or edema. There were 2+ pulses , DP and PT. Neurological
examination revealed he was alert and oriented times three , grossly
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: EKG revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 43
intervals 0.133 , 0.121 , 0.483 , axis 48 ,
interventricular conduction delay , and small ST depression in V4
and V5 of 0.5 mm. Chest x-ray revealed no edema , no infiltrate ,
question of opacity in the right upper lobe versus first rib.
Sodium was 141 , potassium 5.1 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN
12 , creatinine 0.9 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , LDH 298 , troponin I 0 ,
and CK 96.
ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of
coronary artery disease , status post myocardial
infarction and status post angioplasty of his left circumflex and
OM1 branches , admitted with unstable angina over the past six weeks
after a severe episode of chest pain the day prior to admission ,
causing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was
admitted for evaluation and for control of severe hypertension.
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient&apos;s blood pressure was
controlled nicely initially on IV nitroglycerin. His Vasotec was
increased to 10 mg b.i.d. and then discontinued. He was weaned
down off of the IV nitroglycerin and started on Imdur 60 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and was also started on losartan , which was tapered up to 75
mg p.o. q.day with improved control of his blood pressure. The
patient apparently had a poor reaction to Norvasc in the past , so
this medication was not tried.
On 1 of September September 1996 , he underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed a right atrial pressure of 6 , right ventricular pressure
36/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 40/16 , mean of 23 , pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure mean of 11 , left ventricular pressure
195/36 , cardiac output 5.3 , and cardiac index 2.5. He had a 70%
LAD lesion and a 50% first diagonal branch lesion. Circumflex was
okay and he had 40% and 25% serial RCA lesions. A 3.0 micron stent
was placed in the proximal LAD down to a residual of 25%. He was
started on Ticlid and continued on heparin for 48 hours.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol 50 mg
p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin sublingual q.5
minutes p.r.n. , Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.day , losartan 75 mg p.o. q.day ,
and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to be taken for one month.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Eisentrout next week.

Discharge Date: 3/8/2005
ATTENDING: MAZZUCA , MARQUIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raj is a 65-year-old male
with a history of morbid obesity , bilateral leg swelling ,
palpitations , remote seizure disorder last one in 1981 ,
obstructive sleep apnea , has started CPAP in 4/10/2005 , and
migraines.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has a past surgical history of left
meningioma that was diagnosed in 1987 , infection of the plate
that was in his skull that was debrided in 2000 , Achilles repair
in 1975 , and right knee surgery in 1965.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke. He rarely drinks alcohol ,
and denied initial drug surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: His initial height was 5 feet
9-1/2 inches. His weight was 318 pounds on admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He came to Miwest Child University Medical Center
for an attempted lap banding on 7/30/2005 .  Unfortunately during
the surgery , there was damage to the thoracic aorta and the
attempted lap banding turned into an exploratory laparotomy ,
median sternotomy , left thoracotomy , and aortic injury repair.
He suffered cardiac arrest on the operating room table. Left
hemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descending
thoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively ,
and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag and
partial VAC sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Notable for a couple of major events over the
past couple of months , and we will go to those major events. On
7/25/2005 , Mr. Benck was weaned off pressors. On the
10/15/2005 , the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued. On
1/2/2005 , his creatinine started to increase. On 4/15/2005
and 10/12/2005 , the patient was bronched for respiratory distress
with resolution of the respiratory distress. On 10/18/2005 , he
was taken down to the operating room to increase the size of the
endotracheal tube. His abdominal wound dehisced en route , a J
tube was placed , a left triple lumen catheter was placed , and his
exploratory laparotomy wound was able to be closed with wax
sponge to be on top of the wound closure. On 4/30/2005 , he had
a tap of his left chest. There was fluid collection there from
the left thoracotomy. On 8/8/2005 , the left chest tube was
placed and on 1/11/2005 , a left chest tube was discontinued. On
2/7/2005 , he was trached and two chest tubes were placed and a
left VATS was completed again , because of a persisted fluid
collection. On 4/24/2005 , a right PICC was placed and the
triple lumen and his A line were discontinued. On 6/10/2005 , a
TEE was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and no
major regional wall motion abnormalities. On 9/30/2005 , his
trach was changed to a #7. On 2/10/3005 , his trach was changed
to a #8 Portex. On 11/28/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound for
again a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidence
of hydronephrosis. On 3/23/2005 , CVVH was started after Quinton
was placed in the right IJ , on 5/4/2005 , his #8 Portex trach
was replaced with a #8 Shiley. On 10/18/2205 , a clot developed
in the CVVH catheter. On 1/25/2005 , a wound which was being
seen periodically by I&amp;D has had periodic wound I&amp;Ds and VAC
changes. On 6/23/2005 , the right IJ Quinton was discontinued
and a right IJ tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed. On
2/7/2005 , he had a metabolic heart and began to trach collar
for increasing amounts of time. On 9/20/2005 and 12 ,
there was report that his J tube had been slightly displaced and
then had been pushed in by the ICU team. The patient developed
left lower quadrant pain. He was sent down for the CT of the
abdomen and pelvis , and now the J tube was not fully visualized I
think because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast was
not seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tube
feeds safely which we have with no problems. On 6/16/2005 , he
desaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the left
upper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the left
upper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed.
He developed rigor short after with the temperature to 104 , some
mild hypotension and tachycardia. TEE at the bedside show no
dissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. His PICC
was discontinued and the tip was sent for culture , and he
received doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin. He was able to
eventually J-collar through this. On 3/26/2005 , a 3 out of 4
gram negative rods which ended up being enterobacter were
cultured out. We believe that he suffered a transient bacteremia
from the PICC. Levofloxacin was started and ID was consulted
because the enterobacter was resistant about everything except
amikacin and imipenem. On 10/3/2005 , allergy was also consulted
and restarted an imipenem desensitization process which he has
completed , and he is now on imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours for a
total course of 15 days that was started on 10/3/2005 , and a
PICC was replaced. Today , he was planning to go to hemodialysis
in order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that it
is not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia we
would like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. He has been
able to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 units
of heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the catheters
to flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremity
either ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in the
left upper extremity due to the increased swelling. His last
temperature here is 98.3 today. His blood pressure runs
systolics 90 to 110 with a heart rate in the 90s to 110s. He is
on no drips or IV fluids , just his full strength Nepro of 55
which is his goal and he is essentially anuric , but when we do
straight caths which we tend to do once every 1-2 days , he puts
out usually 100-200 cc of urine and he has been J-collaring
successfully now for over three or four days saturations in the
95% to 100% and an FiO2 of 40%. OT and PT have also been seeing
him.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Neurologically , his mental status has much improved. He had
initially some ICU delirium after the initial surgery that has
really greatly improved. He right now is on no major mood
stabilizers or antipsychotics. We do give him oxycodone for
pain , which he really has had to use.
Pulmonarywise , we have kept him on J-collar when he does need to
go for a procedure we do send down the vent in case just because
he is still fairly large person and may need the ventilatory
support for positioning. He is right now on Combivent and DuoNeb
nebulizers p.r.n.
Cardiovascularwise , his blood pressure has been stable and so has
his tachycardia. The beta-blocker that he was initially on
Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenem
desensitization the feeling being that if he did has an
anaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed action
and we did not want any beta-blocker on board. We have held and
would continue it starting at a low dose after he completes his
course of imipenem.
Gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates very
well and there are no issues any more with the J-tube position.
We are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult ,
though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream with
absolutely no problems on p.o. He is also on Pepcid IV for GI
prophylaxis.
Genitourinarywise , he gets hemodialysis every other day. They
have been taking 4-5 liters per day and again with straight
catheterizing once every 1-2 days and usually get about a 100 cc
to 200 cc of urine. Renal has been following him , and they are
unhappy with his course of dialysis. Again , the hemodialysis
catheter is to be wire exchanged today , which is 11/5/2005 , but
again they have been able to use it just fine so far.
Hematologywise , he is on heparin subcutaneous 10 , 000 units t.i.d.
Endocrinewise , we have been checking his fingersticks and he is
right now on Lantus 15 units subcutaneous b.i.d. with a sliding
scale for coverage. He has just been following the fingersticks
that way and imipenem , he is to continue for 14-day course total
of imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours. The first dose was given in
the a.m. on 10/3/2005 , and there are no new culture results
after the gram-negative enterobacter was found. All other
surveillance and urine culture have been negative.

10/6/06 .
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS:
Abdominal wound dehiscence.
PRIMARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Respiratory failure status post tracheostomy , wound dehiscence
with VAC sponge placement.
SECONDARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Morbid obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , COPD - on home oxygen
and BiPAP , settings 15/10 , hypercholesterolemia , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease - with echo dated
3/23/05 with EF of 65% and mild AS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 77-year-old female who was transferred originally from
an outside hospital for continued care after a fascial dehiscence
status post subtotal colectomy. She was originally admitted to
the outside hospital on 10/10/05 with abdominal pain. The CT
scan showed free air. She also had acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 1.8. She was taken to the operating room where she
underwent exploratory laparotomy and where she was found to have
a mid descending colonic perforation secondary to diverticulitis.
She underwent a partial left colectomy and end colostomy with
Hartmann&apos;s pouch. She was placed on clindamycin and levofloxacin
postoperatively. She was extubated on postoperative day #3. She
had persistent elevated white blood cell count for which they
changed antibiotics to Flagyl and fluconazole. A CT scan
revealed questionable dehiscence of her abdominal wound and a
binder was placed. She was subsequently found to be C. diff
positive. She was reintubated for respiratory distress on
postoperative day #7 along with decreased blood pressures and
increased white blood cell count. She was started on
hydrocortisone and pressors were also started. She was extubated
on postoperative day #13 and was started on p.o. meds
subsequently. She was started on her home BiPAP settings. She
is also started on diltiazem drip for her paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She was transferred over to the Vau Haain Medical Center for surgical intervention of her abdominal wound
dehiscence.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. COPD , on home O2 and BiPAP sittings 15/10.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
6. Coronary artery disease - echo dated 3/23/05 with an EF of
65% and mild AS.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO.
2. Exploratory laparotomy with left colectomy and end-colostomy
and Hartmann&apos;s pouch.
Please see the previously dictated discharge summary for the
remainder of her course up to date of 10/27/06 .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
1. On 4/16/06 , tracheostomy.
2. On 2/18/06 , percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
insertion.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE FROM 10/27/06 THROUGH 9/10/06:
Neuro: The patient was maintained on oxycodone per NG tube
initially and then per G-tube for analgesia. She also received
Seroquel for agitation and hallucinations. Upon discharge to
rehabilitation , the patient was alert and oriented , moves all
extremities and following commands. She had good pain control on
oxycodone elixir and Seroquel.
Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
after her initial septic event. She remained in a normal sinus
rhythm for the remainder of her ICU course. She was maintained
on Lopressor 100 per per G-tube q.i.d. Her pressures tolerated
this dose.
Pulmonary: The patient continued on BiPAP failing each trial off
the BiPAP. She would become tachypneic and desaturate with
elevation of her pCO2 once off BiPAP. After several days off
BiPAP trials , the decision was made and discussed with the family
and the patient regarding her need for tracheostomy. It was
explained to her that tidal volumes were low and would drop off
BiPAP and that she would benefit from a tracheostomy placement.
The patient was consented and informed and taken to the operating
room on 4/16/06 where she underwent a tracheostomy. She
tolerated the procedure well. She was quickly weaned to pressure
support ventilation. She was maintained on minimal vent settings
for a couple of days postoperatively. She was eventually trach
collared , as she has been over the last three to four days. The
patient does tire out after two to three hours of trach collar ,
after which we placed her back to pressure support ventilation.
The patient has also had some mild bilateral pleural effusion on
chest x-ray that has not progressed and has been stable
throughout her course. The patient has a history of obstructive
sleep apnea and COPD at baseline. The patient received inhaler
and nebulizers standing and p.r.n. She will need to continue her
trach collar trials most likely having more trach collar trials
at smaller intervals. The patient&apos;s current vent settings upon
discharge to rehabilitation are pressure support 5 and 10 , tidal
volumes 350-400 , breathing at a rate of 23 , and saturating 99% on
an FIO2 of 40%.
GI: Patient&apos;s abdomen remained stable with a VAC sponge. She
had her VAC sponge changed as needed twice a week with good
granulation tissue forming. There were no signs of infection.
Due to the patient&apos;s respiratory failure and need for
tracheostomy , patient also underwent a PEG placement on 2/18/06 .
She tolerated this procedure well. Medications were started on
the day of surgery and her tube feeds were resumed on
postoperative day #1 from her PEG. The patient is currently
receiving Two Cal formula tube feeds at a rate of 45 , which is
her goal rate. She should continue on that. The patient may be
changed to Jevity if she needs more fluid volume. The patient&apos;s
abdomen is soft , VAC sponge in place to suction and draining ,
ostomy is functioning well and viable with good output. The
patient should continue on a H2 blocker for a PPI while on the
vent.
GU: The patient is still somewhat fluid overloaded most likely
due to third spacing due to poor nutrition and
hyperprolactinemia. The patient was aggressively diuresed
throughout her stay with the Lasix drip , and albumin and albumin
and Lasix combination. Over the last few days prior to discharge
to rehab , the patient has responded to boluses of Lasix , actually
diuresing quite well and being negative 500 to a liter negative
daily. The patient&apos;s weight is actually down from admission.
The patient&apos;s urine output is approximately 80 to 100 mL an hour
after a 40 mg bolus of Lasix. The Lasix medication has been held
at this time due to increasing her sodium to 148 on the morning
of discharge. The patient will not be discharged on Lasix.
However , the patient may need a dose of Lasix at 20-40 mg if her
urine output drops off. Upon discharge , the patient has about 1+
edema bilaterally. The patient&apos;s electrolytes upon discharge are
sodium 148 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 96 , CO2 , and bicarbonate 40 ,
BUN 33 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 128 , calcium 9.6 , and magnesium
1.7.
Heme: The patient remained stable from a Hematology standpoint.
Her hematocrit upon discharge was 32. The patient has normal
Coags , INR 1 and PTT 27.3. The patient was maintained on
subcutaneous t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis in addition , to
Pneumoboots. The patient was also started on darbepoetin after
getting iron studies before poor nutrition. There is no signs of
active bleeding.
ID. After patient&apos;s sepsis , she remained relatively afebrile
throughout the rest of her stay. She was VRE positive , grew
Enterococcus from her ostomy. She had no new positive cultures
for the rest of her course. She was maintained off antibiotics
for the rest of her course.
Endocrine: The patient was maintained on tight glycemic control.
She is written for insulin sliding scale approximately q.6 h. in
addition , to a standing regular insulin 4 units q.6 h. plus
Lantus 15 units q.h.s. The patient&apos;s sugars have still been
moderately elevated from about 130 to the 200&apos;s at times. Her
insulin sliding scale should be tightened.
Tube lines and drains: The patient has a trach , PEG , Foley , and
abdominal VAC sponge , and peripheral IVs.
CONSULTATIONS:
Diabetes Medicine , Nutrition.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Diet: The patient should continue on Two Cal tube feeds at a
rate of 45 , which is her goal rate. The patient may switch to
Jevity 1.2 at goal rate of 45 if she needs more fluid volume or
if she is dehydrated.
2. Activity: The patient should be out of bed to chair as often
as possible. She should be trach collared as often as possible
as tolerated.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: weakness , chest pain
***
HPI: Mr Bickford is a 65 year old with a past medical history of
hypertension , cocaine/EtOH abuse , rheumatic heart disease with AI/MR , who
presents with chest pain from rehab 12 hours after discharge from 9 day
admission. His chest pain is identical to prior episodes occurring during
his previous admission. He originally presented with 2-3 weeks of
generalized weakness with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed with
severe polymyositis ( CK up to 33 , 000 ) during last admission. He was given
IVF+bicarb for renal protection from myoglobinuria and became volume
overloaded , with successful diuresis to euvolemia by the time of
discharge. He had intermittent CP occurring at night , described as
nonradiating over left chest associated with SOB. He had persistently
elevated troponin with no ischemic changes on EKG , and his CP was felt to
be due to myocarditis. He was treated with ASA , labetalol , isordil ,
CCB , and ativan with improvement. He was started on IV solumedrol
with immediate significant improvement in CK ( down to 10 , 000 ) and
troponin ( 0.64 ). During his 12 hour stay at rehab , he developed CP
with SOB occurring at night. He was then readmitted to TH for cardiac
catheterization and further care.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Chest pain and shortness of breath. He was re-admitted for nocturnal
chest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. He
underwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy ,
suggesting that the elevated CK-MB and troponin were likely from
myocarditis , as previously suspected. Notably , his chest pain was often
associated with shortness of breath. It was noted on his prior admission
that he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended to
protect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresing
well to lasix. It was thought that his CP and SOB might be due to PND given
his valvular disease. Consequently , his vasoldilatory medications were
switched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bed
kept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. On the day after admission , he
had one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicated
pain in his RUQ. A KUB was negative , as was a PE protocol CT , and he
responded very well to lasix. He had one further episode of SOB at night ,
again responsive to lasix and position. He had a repeat echo that showed
no progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalent
EF of 70-75%. He was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , and
ativan prn.
2. Arrhythmias. He was on rate control with calcium channel blockers.
He had several noctural few beat runs of NSVT , but no other significant
events.
3. Rhabdo: He has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevated
CK , with possible contribution from cocaine. So far , the remaining work up
has been negative. Preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis and
chronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. He
was changed back to IV solumedrol on admission , and switched to PO solumedrol
on discharge. His CK dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , and
then hovered around that dose. Rheumatology Consult Fellow Gavin Nordman felt
this was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent of
recovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months.
diagnosis.
4. Renal. His Cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission ,
likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly from
over-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of BUN of
42. His lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellent
symptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering at
the time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatient
dosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenal
physiology.
5. FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Mr Water You were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined by
looking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you have
not had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. You
do , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune system
attacks and breaks down your muscle. As you know , the recovery process
will be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at least
four to eight weeks. Your rheumatologist , Dr Zoelle , will coordinate your
medication and care. You have an appointment with her in two weeks.
Also , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you will
need to see a cardiologist. You have an appointment with Dr Kissi for this
issue. In addition , you have an appointment with your new primary care
physician , Dr Holverson . Please attend all of these appointments , and be
sure to take all your medications as prescribed. Lastly , it cannot be
emphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take of
yourself , making sure to stop smoking , stop drinking alcohol , and stop
taking any illicit drugs.
Please seek medical attention for difficulty breathing , worsening
weakness , black or bloody stools , or any other concerns.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Myositis. Please follow CK , may need additional agent in the long term.
Per Rheumatology , response may take weeks.
2. Chest pain. His pain is NOT of ischemic origin. He does have rheumatic
heart disease , and appears to have PND with pain and shortness of breath
that is responsive to lasix , position , and oxygen.
3. Lasix dosing. He will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt to
identify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making him
pre-renal.

Discharge Date: 5/2/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND LOWER EXTREMITY SWELLING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old male with
history of diabetes and ischemic
cardiomyopathy who presents on 11/26/01 with increased shortness of
breath and fatigue. His cardiac history began in 1980 , when he
suffered from an myocardial infarction and had a second myocardial
infarction in 1986. He had a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graft
in 1987 with a LIMA-left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft
to OM and saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The patient developed
decreasing functional status postoperatively and recent
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.
In October 2000 , Mr. Straight was admitted to the Luke&apos;s Medical Center with chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed native 3
vessel disease with occlusion of his venous graft to his obtuse
marginal and posterior descending arteries. On that admission , Mr.
Etling was aggressively diuresed and post discharge , he was able to
complete his normal activities of daily living with no shortness of
breath or chest pain. Over the several months prior to admission ,
however , Mr. Knoeppel noted progressive worsening of shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion and fatigue , such that , on the day of
admission , he reported that he could not walk from his driveway to
his house without symptoms. He reported no baseline orthopnea , but
states he does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
history of gallstones , hypothyroidism ,
nephrolithiasis , cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant only for the coronary artery
bypass graft in 1987.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of an myocardial infarction in his
50s. His mother also died of an myocardial
infarction in her 70s.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Captopril 37.5 t.i.d. 2. Isordil
30 t.i.d. 3. Digoxin .125 q. day. 4.
Synthroid .25 q. day. 5. Lipitor 20 q. day. 6. Torsemide 80
b.i.d. 7. Coumadin 4 mg Monday/Wednesday/Friday , 5 mg other days.
8. NPH 40 units b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 97 , pulse 69 ,
blood pressure 100/70 , respiratory rate 16 ,
satting 92% on room air. Neck examination revealed jugular venous
pressure , elevated behind the ear and approximately 27 mm with
positive hepatojugular reflux. The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealed
regular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy , positive S3 and PMI
in the midaxillary line. Abdomen was benign. Extremities showed
no lower extremity edema with 1+ distal pulses and warm to the
touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a sodium of 146 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.3 , hematocrit 36 , INR 1.4.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 67 with left axis deviation ,
right bundle branch block and Q-waves in leads 2 , 3 and AVF.
Chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Ohio
service for diuresis and possible inotrope
support. He was diuresed over the course of 10 days using
Torsemide 80 mg IV t.i.d. and his Captopril was gradually increased
as tolerated to a maximum dose of 75 mg t.i.d. The patient
diuresed without difficulty and by the time of discharge , he had
weighed a dry weight of approximately 96 kilograms.
The patient was also evaluated for possible heart transplant.
Work-up was extensive and included an echocardiogram on 11/20/01 ,
which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20% with global hypokinesis
and akinesis of the inferior septal walls with moderate mitral
regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Abdominal
ultrasound on 11/20/01 , revealed probable cardiac cirrhosis. A
liver spleen scan on 10/1/01 , was consistent with mild cardiac
cirrhosis , as was an MRI of the liver on 4/24/01 .  As a result ,
the patient was not considered a candidate for transplant.
Pulmonary function tests on 4/10/01 , revealed a DLCO = 14 , which
was 49% of expected. On 3/20/01 , the patient underwent a
dobutamine MIBI stress test that was consistent with a moderately
enlarged area of prior myocardial infarction of the left circumflex
territory and posterior descending artery territories. The
examination was also suggestive with an area of modest dobutamine
induced ischemia in the territory of the left anterior descending
with preserved viability.
Endocrine wise , the patient&apos;s diabetes was managed in-house on a
regular insulin sliding scale. Because his hemoglobin A1C level
was below 6 on discharge , he was placed back on his regiment of NPH
40 units b.i.d. In terms of his thyroid , we made no adjustments to
his Levoxyl regiment. He has been coumadinized for a low ejection
fraction and was discharged on his regular regiment of 4 mg
Monday/Wednesday/Friday and 5 mg on all other days.
The patient also has a history of depression and he was maintained
on Prozac 20 mg q. day.
Hematologically , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 36
during his hospitalization. His MCV = 75.1 in a 61-year-old male
with necrocytic anemia. We obtained a colonoscopy which revealed
polyps , all of which were snagged with no complications. The
pathologies are currently pending.

Discharge Date: 5/30/2003
ADMIT DIAGNOSES: 1. HEART FAILURE.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HISTORY OF CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.
4. ASTHMA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year-old woman
with history of dilated cardiomyopathy
and estimated ejection fraction of 35 to 40% who presented with
lower extremity edema , weakness , fatigue , and syncopal episodes x
2. At baseline the patient states that she is able to walk and
perform her activities of daily living without symptoms of heart
failure. Per patient , about five days prior to admission , she
began to notice increasing lower extremity edema , rapidly spreading
from her calves up to her thighs. She also noted symptoms of
weakness and fatigue. On 9/29/03 the patient reported two syncopal
episodes- the first of which was preceded by dizziness after which
she lost consciousness after lying down. She awoke and walked to
her apartment where she apparently lost consciousness a second time
although she does not remember having any prodromal symptoms prior
to the second episode. The patient was found by her neighbor and
taken to the Niry Hospital .  At Labi Straubll Hospital ,
the patient was treated for heart failure with diuresis with IV
Lasix. An echocardiogram at the Malvfi Hospital showed an ejection
fraction of 10 to 15% , 4+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and
ECG showed no ischemic changes. The patient did have one run of
11-beat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Liver function
tests were noted to be elevated. Her hepatitis panel was
reportedly negative. The patient was transferred from Got Center
to Towhiddle Amentcon Pal Medical Center as her primary care physician and
cardiologist are at Oten Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypotension. History of cerebrovascular
accident. Type II diabetes mellitus.
Asthma. Dilated cardiomyopathy.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , Albuterol inhaler , Flovent inhalers ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals , Colace , iron , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH 35 units q.a.m. and
q.p.m. , Humalog sliding scale , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.3. WBC normal. TSH was normal at
2.1 , ESR 8. ECG showed sinus rhythm , left atrial
enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , no ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient has a dilated
cardiomyopathy and was admitted with volume
overload. The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix throughout her
hospital course with successful diuresis of 1 to 2 liters of fluid
per day. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to
25% , severe global hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right and left heart
catheterization was performed. The right heart catheterization
showed the following: Right atrial pressure was 8 , right
ventricular pressure 35/5 , PA pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of
15. The left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronary
artery disease , no obstructive lesions. The patient showed marked
clinical improvement with diuresis with IV Lasix. Prior to
discharge the Lasix was changed from IV to p.o. and the patient was
stable on p.o. regimen of Lasix prior to discharge. The left heart
catheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary artery
disease. The patient was continued on statin for this reason. The
patient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along with
a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outside
hospital. This raised the concern along with her low ejection
fraction that she could be having arrhythmias causing syncope. On
telemetry during this admission , the patient was noted to have
additional runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia along with
an episode of complete heart block. The electrophysiology service
was consulted and placed an ICD and pacer on 11/25/03 .  This
procedure was well tolerated.
Renal: The patient was noted to have low albumin on admission and
protein in her urine , concerning for nephrotic syndrome. Renal
consult was obtained. The 24-hour urine was collected. Renal
ultrasound was negative for hydrosis or renal vein thrombosis. An
SPEP and UPEP were sent which are pending at the time of this
dictation. The renal consult felt that the diabetes mellitus was
the likely explanation for the protein wasting in the urine. The
patient was continued on an Ace inhibitor.
Infectious disease: The patient was noted to have a localized area
of infection at the area of old IV site on admission. She was
started on p.o. dicloxacillin to treat this infection. Surgery was
consulted and ruled out septic thrombophlebitis.
Hematology: The patient was taken off Coumadin on admission but
was continued on heparin for anticoagulation. The Coumadin was
restarted after the pacer and ICD were placed.
Endocrine: The patient was treated on a regimen of Lentes and
insulin sliding scale. Her blood sugars were stable on this
regimen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will planned to
be discharged on the following medications:
Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.hs. , Lentes 40
units subcu q.hs. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , and Keflex 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Avary . She will follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Dobies , on
3/3/03 .  She will have a repeat echocardiogram in July to
reassess her ejection fraction and valvular disease.

734704198 | AIMH | 52319813 | | 7554935 | 2/23/2003 12:00:00 AM | BACK PAIN | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 2/12/2003 Report Status: Signed

Discharge Date: 4/22/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67-year-old man with a
history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting , mitral valve
replacement with previous history of endocarditis in April 2002
who presents with severe back pain. The patient was well until
Friday before admission when he drove 2 1/2 hours to Coln As Las
and he had some back stiffness. The following day the patient
noted back pain , took some Tylenol but remained &quot;stiff all day&quot;.
On the following day , Sunday , he appeared better , able to tolerate
walking well. On Monday he again had severe pain , came to the
emergency department here at Ux Erla A Hospital where he
had a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities.
He was discharged to home with Percocet. On the morning of
admission the patient was again with pain. He was urged by his
cardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule out
epidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. He was negative
for any fever or chills. No bowel or bladder incontinence. No
radiation of pain down the legs.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except for HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.0 , heart rate 78 , blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 95% on
room air. GENERAL: The patient was sitting in the stretcher ,
comfortable but with pain upon movement. HEENT: Pupils are equal
and reactive to light. Mucous membranes moist. Oropharynx is
clear. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a mechanical
S1 and S2. PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with
trace bibasilar crackles. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender ,
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm and well
perfused. 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
Lower extremities limited by pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting , status
post myocardial infarction , mitral valve replacement with a St.
Jude valve , congestive heart failure , history of endocarditis ,
history of hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg q day , digoxin 0.125
mg q day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Captopril
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol 50 mg q day , Lipitor 80 mg q day ,
Coumadin 3 mg po q day , Levoxine 75 mg q day , Lasix p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a white blood cell count
of 11.17 , hematocrit of 44.6 ,
platelet count of 129 , with 27 lymphocytes , 55 neutrophils , D-dimer
278.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 67-year-old male with a history of mitral valve
replacement complaining of severe back pain with
Streptococcus endocarditis in 2002 admitted of thoracic back pain
for four days. The pain progressed to the point where the patient
had difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. CT scan of the
thoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative for
abscess. The patient had no fevers. His admission exam was benign
with no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. There
was variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain to
palpation over the spine. The patient was managed conservatively
with Oxycodone , Motrin and Baclofen. He was initially admitted to
GMS , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then became
negative.
1. Infectious disease: Blood cultures drawn on March , 2003
grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. Due
to concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epidural
abscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. Infectious
disease consult was obtained. Vancomycin and gentamicin were
started on March , 2003. On October , 2003 a transesophageal
echocardiogram was negative for vegetation. A MRI of the spine was
negative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI did
show severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing the
patient&apos;s back pain. The patient has had numerous positive blood
cultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , blood
cultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative work
up including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negative
transesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negative
abdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative tagged
white blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. Dental
consult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic source
from the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicion
for an oral source. Repeat films and dental evaluation on November , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as an
outpatient. There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gums
that occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing from
poor dentition and gum care. The dentist recommended deep cleaning
as an outpatient with prophylactic antibiotics. the patient was
initially started on gentamicin , vancomycin , on October , 2003
switched to gentamicin and penicillin. He will complete a 2 week
course of gentamicin and penicillin G on November , 2003. At that time
on August , 2003 the patient should start a 4-week course of
ceftriaxone 1 gram q day. PICC line was placed on August , 2003
to provide long term access for antibiotics.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol , Imdur ,
switched from Captopril to Lisinopril. Rhythm: The patient was on
amniocentesis , digoxin , Coumadin for St. Jude valve and paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI is negative. Pain significantly
improved on January , 2003. The patient was on Neurontin and
OxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting on
Baclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persists
outside the treatment of endocarditis.
3. Endocrine: Continue on Synthroid.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Insurance does not cover home
antibiotics so the patient will be
discharged to a skilled nursing facility for intravenous
antibiotics likely to the O Hospital on August ,
2003.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Follow the patient&apos;s INR closely while on Motrin and
antibiotics , in the past when on antibiotics his INR has been
difficult to control , goal range for the patient should be
around 2.8 to 3.5 and his Coumadin was increased from 3-4 mg
on August , 2003 given that his INR was trending downward to
2.0 on January , 2003.
2. Complete a 14-day course of penicillin G , gentamicin on November ,
2003 then complete additional four seeks of ceftriaxone
starting on August , 2003 to be completed on July , 2003.
3. The pain is likely secondary at least partially to
degenerative joint disease with some contribution possibly
from an infectious source but unlikely. Should titrate the
pain medications down as tolerated.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day , digoxin
0.125 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Motrin 400-600 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. for back or
musculoskeletal pain take with food , Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q day ,
oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q 4-6h p.r.n. pain hold if somnolent or
respiratory rate less than 12 , Senna tablets two tablets p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q day , Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Imdur
30 mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec 40 mg p.o. q
day , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
gentamicin sulfate 110 mg IV q 12h x six days , penicillin G 3
million units IV q 4h x six days , Ceftriaxone not to be started
until August , 2003 for 28 day course ending July , 2003 1000 mg
intravenously q day , OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q 12h x seven days.
FOLLOW UP: The patient should follow up with Dr. Jefferey Mero ,
cardiologist at Blackci Medical Center who knows
the patient well and who also will follow his INR levels once
discharged from the rehabilitation center.

Hospital Course.
( 1 ) CV: The patient was admitted with dyspnea and chest pain. On exam ,
he was in volume overload with episodic atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. At time of admission , he admitted to recent
dietary indiscretions. Of note , his digoxin level at time of admission
was also less than assay , suggesting medication noncompliance. He was
ruled out for MI by serial ECG and enzymes. His dyspnea/chest pain was
associated with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
improved with rate control and diuresis. He was digoxin loaded and
aggressively diuresed to a weight of 140.7 kg. On day of discharge ,
his breathing was back to baseline and he appeared euvolemic by exam.
He will be discharged on coumadin for his atrial fibrillation/history
of PE. As his INR was 1.9 at time of discharge , he will not be
discharge on a lovenox bridge but will need to follow-up in 2 days for
an INR check. He will follow-up with Dr. Youmans , Dr. Elke ( his new
PCP ) , and the cardiology anticoagulation service.
( 2 ) PSYCH: The TM team was consulted for his nicotene addiction and
made referrals for him to the smoking cessation program at the Johour Memorial Hospital .
Pyschiatry was consulted , and they recommended resuming celexa. In
addition , he was sent up to see a psychiatric social worker for
counseling.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your primary care doctor if you should develop worsening
shortness of breath or weight gain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable

right upper quadrant tenderness/epigastric. Pulsatile liver ,
positive bowel sounds. Rectal refused. Extremities showed no
edema , well perfused. Pulses 1+ dorsalis pedis , 2+ tibialis
anterior. Neurologic exam was alert and oriented x three , grossly
intact.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: White blood cell count 7.3 , hematocrit
42.4 , platelets 240. PTT 30.6 , INR 3.1.
Urinalysis was pending. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 123 ,
positive PVCs , left axis deviation , nonspecific T wave inversion
AVL , V5 , V6. Chest x-ray showed a very dilated heart , prominent
hila , increased PVR , no effusions. AICD lead seen in right
ventricle.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Congestive heart failure. The patient has
clear evidence of left and right systolic
dysfunction. Patient with known cardiomyopathy , may have had
worsening of function with recent viral upper respiratory
infection. No clear dietary indiscretions. Begin Lasix drip ,
strict Is and Os , daily weights , low salt diet , cardiac monitor ,
check echo. 2. Abdominal pain. May have food poisoning on
Sunday. Also may have gastritis or pancreatitis. Right upper
quadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure.
3. History of hypothyroidism. Check TSH.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiomyopathy service , Dr. Jim Gerardot ,
attending , began following patient on the first
hospital day. It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and
recommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of
keeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. The
patient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during the
entire hospital stay. Patient does not tolerate well either the
immediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. The IV
form hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but he
still prefers the oral form. Over the course of the admission , 10
mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,
eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.
Captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day on
the second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg three
times a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affect
our ability to diurese with Lasix. After six days , the patient was
adequately diuresed. JVP was now not visible. Lungs were clear.
There was no edema. The patient is tolerating captopril well.
Coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mg
per day because of the high INR on admission. Two days prior to
discharge , INR fell to 1.9. Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.
At discharge , INR was 1.7. Patient does not wish to stay to have
INR corrected. VNA has been arranged to administer Lovenox and to
check PT , PTT over the next few days until this normalizes to a
therapeutic level.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , Compazine 10
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.
Patient is being discharged home with VNA services. He will follow
up with Dr. Scottie Fowles on 11 of May at 9:20 A.M.

Discharge Date: 10/16/2004
ATTENDING: MILFORD WIZWER M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familial
cardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% with
marked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitral
regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and PA pressures of 51
plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. He was also status
post ICD placement in 2001. At baseline , he has a one staircase
exercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. He also
admits that he has been having increasing orthopnea and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies , chest pain ,
palpitations , or peripheral edema. He also has a history of
dietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to
heart failure exacerbations. Currently , he states that he has
been eating &quot;salty foods , &quot; and has been drinking a lot of extra
fluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking
his medications. Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in his
exercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably an
increase in abdominal girth. Because of these symptoms
consistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians
suggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of
his decompensated heart failure. Of note , he has been previously
on a transplant list , but has been delisted given his
noncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
In addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiency
with the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril
2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125
once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. for
volume overload.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,
occasional alcohol use , no IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
His mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have the
familial cardiomyopathy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to
20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. His
cardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI with
the right ventricular heave. He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites and
palpable liver edge. His extremities were warm without edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
From the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diurese
him IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. However , he did not respond well
enough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with
Zaroxolyn p.r.n. We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitor
early on because of blood pressures in the 80s. On admission ,
his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was
2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to start
a low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. However , his urine
output was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increased
the Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg
IV Lasix bolus. On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 an
hour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very good
and effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,
negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in with
admission weight of around 90 kg. On each day , he diuresed about
an half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,
he was less than 86 kg. We monitored strict I&apos;s and O&apos;s , checked
daily weight. During the course of his diuresis , his sodium
levels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking a
lot of free water. The combination of free water intake in the
setting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of his
hyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually
to 122. We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake
to less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodium
levels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day of
discharge. We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. Eventually , his blood
pressures remained stable. His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 on
admission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urine
output , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasix
drip for one more day. We then discontinued the Lasix drip and
transitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , which
was his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. He
continued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of
discharge , his I&apos;s and O&apos;s were finally about 500 cc negative ,
which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. His
JVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. We
re-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours and
his blood pressures were stable in the 90s. Given his potassium ,
which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decided
to increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given his
underlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standing
K-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. An echo was done , which
showed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. They did not
comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. However , he
is a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS
complex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good
heart failure regimen up until this point.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
At discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mg
once a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. We also added folate 5
mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.
He also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.
DISPOSITION:
He is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr.
Grassi in her Thyroid Clinic on 3/1/05 .  He has been again urged
to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he
is a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he
is not listed given the aforementioned reasons. Overall , Mr.
Plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. He
no longer has orthopnea. He is able to exert himself much more
without symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and
he is eager to go home

Discharge Date: 4/2/1999
IDENTIFICATION: A 73-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for extensive coronary artery disease , diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and smoking , who presents with
chest pain , and is admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Boyles has a long history of
coronary artery disease with a coronary artery bypass graft in
1989 , left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft
to the obtuse marginal artery three. In 1992 he had unstable
angina , and catheterization showed that the distal grafts were
totally occluded. He had a redo coronary artery bypass graft with
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and the
left circumflex , his postoperative course being complicated by
atrial fibrillation. In 1996 , he had a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of
the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , and saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery. In 1997 , he had a repeat
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal one , and an saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery. Most recently he was admitted in
October of 1999 with an exercise tolerance test mibi , for which
exercise for four minutes and seven seconds he had inferolateral
ischemia. Echocardiogram showed an left ventricular ejection
fraction of 50 percent , anterior inferior posterior hypokinesis , 1
to 2+ mitral regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of
42.0 millimeters of mercury plus right atrial pressure of 6.
Catheterization showed 100 percent occlusion of his saphenous vein
graft to the diagonal one , which was stented. His right coronary
artery and diagonal one were totally occluded. His left anterior
descending artery was 95 percent. His left circumflex was clear.
At that time he was randomized to the Airssylv Medical Center trial. At baseline ,
Mr. Dodwell denies exertional chest pain or any angina. He does get
short of breath with one flight of stairs , or going uphill for one
block. He gets claudication after walking three house lots.
He was in his usual state of health until one day prior to
admission when he noted the onset of 4/10 aching chest , shoulder ,
and left arm pain while watching television , and it was associated
with shortness of breath. He sat still , waited for it to
dissipate. At 7:00 p.m. , he took one sublingual nitroglycerin with
a decrease of pain. At 11:00 p.m. , he took one sublingual
nitroglycerin and went to sleep before noting no change in the
pain. He was driving to his appointment with Dr. Stolberg , his
primary cardiologist on the morning of admission , with the return
of the chest pain for one to two minutes and it was gone
spontaneously. At Dr. Boulanger office , he was noted to have new
lateral T wave inversions and was sent down to the Emergency Room
for admission.
Mr. Demik denies any associated nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,
exertional or pleuritic chest pain currently , fever , chills , or
cough. He does report stable lower extremity edema , but denies
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or palpitations. He has
poor exercise tolerance.
His cardiac risk factors include the following: Age , diabetes ,
hypertension , cholesterol , smoking , and family history.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is as follows: 1.
Hypertension. 2. Diabetes with fingersticks of 120 to 160 at
home. 3. Hypercholesterolemia , his last panel in August of 1999

fibrillation. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency. 6. Benign
prostatic hypertrophy. 7. Peripheral vascular disease , status
post carotid endarterectomies bilaterally. 8. Status post
cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia repair.
ALLERGIES: His allergies include Quinaglute , lisinopril , and
verapamil. He thinks they cause gastrointestinal upset.
MEDICATIONS: His medications include the following: 1. Coumadin
5 milligrams q.d. 2. Atenolol 25 milligrams q.d. 3. Mitozalone
5 milligrams q.d. 4. Lasix 160 milligrams q.d. 5. Atorvastatin

8. NPH 34 q.a.m. , 10 q.p.m. , regular insulin 4 q.p.m. 9.
Finasteride 5 q.d. 10. Colchicine 0.6 milligrams p.r.n. 11.
Aspirin 81 milligrams q.d. 12. Restoril 30 milligrams p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He occasionally drinks alcohol. He has a 120 pack
year smoking history , quit in 1989. He is a retired machinist and
lives with his wife of 53 years.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of a myocardial infarction at 77.
His sister had a coronary artery bypass graft at 70. He has many
brother , one of whom is 71 who had a myocardial infarction at 44 ,
and one who had a coronary artery bypass graft at 70.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination in general , he is a
pleasant elderly man in no apparent distress. His vital signs , his
heart rate was 96 , blood pressure 174/64 , saturating 95 percent on
room air. He had carotid bruits bilaterally. His lungs were
clear. His jugular venous pressure was less than 5.0 centimeters.
His PMI was nonpalpable. He had a regular rate with a 1/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without radiation.
Extremities , he had a left femoral thrill and bilateral femoral
bruits. He had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. His
extremities were warm without edema. His neurologic examination
was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: His labs on admission were significant for a BUN
and creatinine of 49 and 1.3 , hematocrit of 40.5. His urinalysis
was normal. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 53 , left
axis deviation , right bundle branch block , no hypertrophy , no Q ,
new T wave inversion in V4 through V6. Chest x-ray was clear. His
Troponin was 0.45 , CK was 197 , his myoglobin was 159 , his INR was
1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 73-year-old man with
extensive coronary artery disease , who presents with one day of his
typical anginal pain , multiple bruits , new lateral T wave
inversions , admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction. His
hospital course by issue:
1. Cardiovascular: Mr. Jinkerson was catheterized on the evening of
admission , and he was found to have the following. He was found to
have a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one was 100 percent
occluded. Saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery
was open. His left main was 30 percent occluded. His left
anterior descending artery was 99 percent occluded. His diagonal
one was 100 percent occluded. His left circumflex was 80 percent
occluded. His left subclavian which was supplying his left
internal mammary artery was 100 percent occluded. He was taken
back to the Catheterization Laboratory the next day with Dr.
Devincenzo who performed a left subclavian artery stent and also a
left brachial artery angioplasty. Mr. Maheu tolerated this
procedure well. He had no return of his chest pain after the
procedure , and his pulses remained normal , he had no groin
hematoma. He was placed on Plavix. He also continued his aspirin ,
and his Coumadin was restarted after the heparin and intravenous
TNG which were originally put on board to prevent arterial spasm
after the procedure , were discontinued. His next cardiovascular
issue was his blood pressure. He was originally on atenolol 25
milligrams q.d. , we added back Cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. which he
had been on before admission and had been stopped a month prior
because he had low blood pressure with a systolic in the 80s.
However , his first day here , his systolic pressure was 120 to 130 ,
and restarted it. He had no problems with that. His blood
pressure a few days after admission was in the 150 to 160 systolic
over 70 , and amlodipine was added to his regimen. He was continued
on his outpatient doses of Lasix 160 milligrams q.a.m. and
mitozalone 5 q.d. He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
2. Renal: After the first catheterization , Mr. Ong creatinine
went from 1.3 to 1.8. However , it went back to 1.3 the next day.
After the second catheterization it went up to a peak of 4.3.
However , his urine output remained at 100 to 150 cc an hour with
Lasix 100 milligrams intravenous p.r.n. , in addition to his morning
dose of 160 milligrams q.a.m. , and he was given normal saline
intravenous fluids to equalize his ins and outs. He did not have
any signs of cholesterol emboli , no levator reticularis , no
eosinophilia , no blue toes.
3. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: He had a low potassium on the
morning of admission with a potassium of 2.7 because he had missed
his outpatient K-Dur of 60 mEq q.d. He had no symptoms , he had no
electrocardiogram changes. He was repleted throughout admission
and was kept on his outpatient dose of K-Dur and had no problems
further with potassium. In addition , he was discharged on a
standing dose of magnesium because his magnesium was routinely low
throughout admission , on the order of 1.5 to 1.8.
4. Hematology: On the day after his catheterization , his
hematocrit dropped from 33.0 to 28.0. He was transfused two units
with an appropriate bump back to 33.0. He tolerated this without
any problems.
5. Diabetes: He was maintained on his outpatient regimen of NPH
30/10 and 4 regular q.p.m. , and Rezulin. His blood sugars were
maintained throughout admission.
6. Genitourinary: He was maintained on his finasteride for benign
prostatic hypertrophy. In addition , he had a biopsy prior to
admission which had shown chronic prostatitis. His outpatient
urologist had recommended ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams b.i.d. for
thirty days. Since the hospital does not carry ciprofloxacin , we
put him on Levofloxacin 500 milligrams q.d. He had no return of
those symptoms.
7. Musculoskeletal: On hospital day number four , he developed
excruciating point tenderness in the medial aspect of his right
knee. The knee did not appear swollen or red , and he had no source
of trauma. However , it was thought it might be a recrudescence of
his gout. The next day it was more warm and slightly swollen.
Colchicine helped somewhat , and he was then put on a prednisone
taper starting at 40 milligrams and tolerated this well.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged to home in stable condition on
October , 1999. He has follow-up appointments with his primary
doctor , Dr. Eslinger , on August , 2000 , his primary cardiologist ,
Dr. Edd , on January , 1999 , and Dr. Notowich who performed
the procedure on the subclavian artery on January , 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: His medications on discharge are the
following: 1. Cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. 2. Restoril 30
milligrams q.d. q.h.s. p.r.n. 3. Nitroglycerin 0.4 milligrams
p.r.n. chest pain , sublingual , may repeat times three q.5 minutes.
4. Regular insulin 4 units q.p.m. , NPH 34 units q.a.m. 10 units

BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of
a 35 to 40 pack year smoking , and non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus for 14 years. The patient has been waking with occasional
shortness of breath over the preceding three weeks , and having
chest pressure lasting 30 seconds to a minute that resolves
spontaneously. The night prior to admission , the patient woke from
sleep with severe dyspnea , chest pressure , and diaphoresis. He
denied any nausea , pain , or radiation of his symptoms. The
paramedics were called and the patient was noted to have an oxygen
saturation of 70 to 80 percent on room air. He was intubated in
the field and taken to Tlwake University Hospital .  The initial
electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in V1 to V3 , with T wave
inversions in V3 through V6. He was treated with tPA at Enle Hospital .  He was treated with intravenous Lasix for presumed
congestive heart failure and hypertension , and was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit. He was placed on nitroglycerin drip which was
titrated to his blood pressure. He was successfully extubated the
following morning. He was started on metoprolol , digoxin ,
lisinopril , and a heparin drip. He underwent an echocardiogram
which showed an ejection fraction of 25 percent with global
hypokinesis. He remained pain-free throughout his hospitalization ,
and had no further episodes of dyspnea. He was transferred to the
Wadl Uhump Medical Center on February , 1998 for further management of
his myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of renal carcinoma status post
nephrectomy in 1994. 2. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3. Mild hypercholesterolemia which is not currently being treated.
4. Renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy with a baseline
creatinine of 2.0.

Furosemide. 6. Zocor. 7. Lopressor. 8. Digoxin. 9. Pepcid.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 to 40 pack year history of tobacco.
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denies any drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , overweight man in
no acute distress. Vital signs: The patient had a temperature of
98.4 , heart rate 77 , blood pressure 143/78 , respirations 18 , and
oxygen saturation of 91 percent on three liters by nasal cannula.
HEENT examination showed pupils that were equal , round , and
reactive to light and accommodation. Conjunctiva were anicteric.
Extraocular movements are intact , and his oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination was supple with his jugular venous pressure at
approximately 8.0 centimeters. There was no lymphadenopathy.
Chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally , with no
rales. Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
non-displaced PMI and a positive S3. There was no murmur.
Abdominal examination showed an obese , soft abdomen with positive
bowel sounds. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. No
masses were palpated. The extremities were warm with no edema. He
had 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally. His left lower extremity had a
1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His right lower
extremity had a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse with a nonpalpable
posterior tibial pulse. Neurological examination , he was alert and
oriented x three. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are intact and
symmetric. He had 5/5 strength throughout. Deep tendon reflexes
were 2+ throughout with downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies from Ter Memorial Hospital showed a sodium
of 139 , potassium of 4.5 , chloride 109 , CO2 of 21 , BUN of 22 , and
creatinine of 2.2. Glucose was 236. Liver function tests were
within normal limits with an alkaline phosphatase of 95 , total
bilirubin of 0.4 , and AST of 39. CPKs were 151 , 163 , and 163 with
no MB fractions done. His TnI was less than 0.2 to 0.3. He had a
white count of 14.2 with a hematocrit of 42.9 and platelets of 222.
His triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol was
elevated at 265 with an HDL fraction of 32 and an LDL fraction of
172. His prothrombin time was 11.3 , partial thromboplastin time
28.4 , and INR 0.85. Urinalysis was negative. An electrocardiogram
was performed at the time of admission which showed resolution of
the ST elevations. He had T wave inversions in V2 through V4 , and
flat T waves in V5 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Myocardial Infarction: He was
continued on a heparin drip , Lopressor , and lisinopril. His
digoxin was discontinued at the time of admission. Nitroglycerin
was given only p.r.n. He remained symptom-free throughout his
hospitalization. His elevated cholesterol was treated. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1998 which showed 50
percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid left
anterior descending. His right coronary artery was occluded. The
patient did well both during and after the catheterization. The
patient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on January , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.
The mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as an
infarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.
Options were considered including coronary artery bypass grafting
and angioplasty. After a long discussion with the Cardiology
Service , Cardiac Surgery , the Renal Service and the patient , the
decision was made to proceed with angioplasty. On July , 1998 ,
the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residual
blockage. He also had two stents into his left anterior descending
with zero percent residual blockage. The patient tolerated the
procedure well.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma for
which he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. He also has chronic
renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. As surgery was being
considered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation was
obtained to evaluate his renal status. He underwent a renal
ultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. This
was very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. He then underwent
an MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney which
was most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. This
was reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.
The patient&apos;s renal function remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.
3. Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was
placed on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. He
was instructed to continue with his Glyburide , and to follow-up as
usual with his outpatient provider.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 1998 , one day
following his second catheterization procedure. The patient did
very well following the procedure , and had remained pain and
dyspnea-free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. three times per day. 4. Nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual
tablets , one sublingually every five minutes x three as needed for
chest pain. 5. Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s. 7. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Ticlid 250 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with his
primary care physician , and to call the office to schedule an
appointment. The necessary follow-up with Cardiology and with the
nephrologist will be scheduled as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 1/1/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who
was followed in cardiology by
Dr. Pikula who has presumed diastolic dysfunction , who was in her
usual state of health until 1/23 , when she was admitted to the Dobubay Naicent University Of Medical Center with a flare of Crohn&apos;s ileitis.
At the time of her discharge , she was not restarted on her Lasix
and subsequently developed fluid retention with gradual worsening ,
shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. The patient noted a
20 lb weight gain during this period , as well as increasing
orthopnea and increasing dyspnea on exertion when getting dressed
or doing any different movements. She was seen in cardiology
clinic on 8/3/02 and found to be in much worse congestive heart
failure with new atrial fibrillation. She was transferred then to
the emergency department here at the Peresvillee Nawvine University Of Hospitals And Clinics .
Her most recent echocardiogram on 4/29/01 revealed mild to
moderate left ventricular hypertrophy without any regional wall
motion abnormalities. Her systolic ejection fraction was estimated
to be 60% suggesting a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and heart
failure. She was admitted with volume overload for diuresis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The review of symptoms was notable for chest
tightness with occasional palpitations. She
experienced no dizziness , no syncope and no recent diarrhea , no
abdominal pain , no nausea or vomiting. She did report chronic
arthritis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Significant for congestive heart failure
due to diastolic dysfunction , ( 2 ) Crohn&apos;s
colitis diagnosed in 1963 , ( 3 ) Right breast carcinoma stage II
previously treated , not currently active , ( 4 ) Diabetes mellitus ,
( 5 ) Obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
( 7 ) Hypercholesterolemia , ( 8 ) Osteoarthritis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a prior tobacco smoker , having
smoked two packs per day for 38 years , but has
quit. She does not drink alcohol and does not use any recreational
drugs. The patient lives in Di with a friend and is a retired
x-ray technician.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ALLERGIES: The patient&apos;s medical allergies include penicillin ,
which causes a rash , Demerol and Dilaudid causing
nausea , and Macrodantin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Included a temperature of 97 ,
heart rate 76 , blood pressure 90/60 ,
respiratory rate 28 , and a saturation of 97% on room air. The
patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. GENERAL: Physical
examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented x3 , in
no acute distress , having shortness of breath while sitting up in
bed. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , and
reactive , extraocular movements were intact. NECK: Showed jugular
venous distention to at least 20 cm. CHEST: Showed crackles
posteriorly approximately half of the way up. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Showed an irregular rhythm and a systolic ejection murmur
consistent with the prior diagnosis of aortic stenosis. ABDOMEN:
Showed profound obesity. EXTREMITIES: Showed significant pitting
edema bilaterally over the calves.
LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white blood cell count of 7 , hematocrit
31 , platelets of 148. Sodium was 142 , potassium
3.9 , BUN 56 , creatinine 1.3 , with a glucose of 75. Liver function
tests were normal. CK was 44 and troponin was 0.02. A chest x-ray
showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion without any evidence of
infiltrates. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 72 ,
otherwise no abnormalities beside some nonspecific ST-T wave
changes. Urinalysis showed evidence of an urinary tract infection
with 20-30 white blood cells and was leukocyte esterase positive.
Urine culture was sent at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Congestive heart failure - The patient was
started on IV Lasix along with Zaroxolyn and
responded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission.
The patient&apos;s weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. It was
estimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately
15 liters. The patient was reported great improvement in her
symptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplemental
oxygen. The patient was switched to oral Lasix and continued her
diuresis. The day prior to discharge , the patient was switched to
oral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication.
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient was noted to have new onset
of atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on
8/3/02 . Since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillation
had been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate the
patient. She was initially started on intravenous unfractionated
heparin while starting anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient
reached a therapeutic INR of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days and
the IV heparin was discontinued. At the time of discharge , the
patient INR was 3.2. She will have INR follow up through her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Janousek . Currently , the decision to
cardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatient
cardiologist.
3. Urinary tract infection - The patient&apos;s initial urinalysis
indicated a bacterial urinary tract infection. Subsequent urine
culture grew out E. coli , which was subsequently determined to be
resistant to levofloxacin. Initially , the patient had been started
on IV levofloxacin , which was subsequently changed to p.o.
cefixime. The patient completed a five-day course of p.o. cefixime
while here in the hospital and was discharged on that medicine to
complete a 10-day course. Of note , the initial symptoms the
patient had including hematuria , resolved by the time of discharge.
4. Diabetes mellitus - The patient has a long history of diabetes
requiring insulin treatment. She is followed by endocrinologist at
the Kingnix Lowemar W.kell Medical Center .  During this hospitalization , her
blood sugars were maintained with insulin subcutaneous injections.
The patient is to continue the management of her diabetes per her
endocrinologist.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: chest pain
---
HPI:This is a 63 year-old female with history of CAD s/p MI and PCI
( stent to D1; see cardiac anatomy below ) , HTN , DM , hypercholesterolemia ,
obesity. She was last in her usual state of health approximately 1
month ago when she developed a &quot;head cold&quot; that has been marked by
frequent coughing and SOB/DOE. Her appetite has been quite poor , and she
reports occasional dizziness. She has been taking her diuretics
faithfully and has been making her usual UOP. She has not been using her
CPAP recently due to her head cold.
She awoke this morning feeling as if she were being choked. She reports
coughing quite violently and bringing up grayish/yellowish sputum
( no blood ). After her coughing spell , she became quite nauseated but
cannot remember if she threw up. She also developed some diffuse
chest tightness that lasted for approximately 10 minutes ,
associated with subjective fevers and diaphoresis. She returned to
sleep , but this time sitting up in her sofa. She reports that she has
been coughing throughout the day with 1 additional fleeting
episode of chest tightness this evening. She was CP-free upon
evaluation in the ED.
Of note , her presenting symptom during her NSTEMI back in &apos;02 was low
back pain.

Review of Systems: As above. She further denies weight gain/loss , LE
edema , orthopnea , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV: Started on IV Heparin and Lipitor dose increased to 80mg. Cont&apos;d
b-blocker and full dose aspirin. Pt was free of CP upon admission and
throughout admission. EKG remained at baseline abnormal but showed no
overt ischemic changes. Her first set of enzymes revealed a slightly
elevated CK 371 w/MB fraction of 3.7 , but all three troponins were
negative. Although her story was not convincing for ACS , her TIMI score=4
( known CAD , more than 2 episodes in last 24 h , previous ASA use , 3
cardiac RF&apos;s of HTN , DM , CHOL ).
MIBI nondiagnostic b/c of obesity. Pt did not tolerate cardiac PET on
8/17 , b/c of anxiety/claustraphobia , then refused to have study w/IVCS.
Given the fact that pt ruled out for MI , and that pain did not recur ,
team suspects CP may be related to cough ( M/S and/or pleuritic in
etiology ) and no further inpt CAD workup was pursued. Pt to f/u w/her
cardiologist 11/3 .
2. RENAL: new ARF likely secondary to taking home lasix in setting of
poor PO&apos;s , Cr improved to 1.4 after holding Cozaar and diuretics and
giving IVF. Pt instructed to restart Lasix and Cozaar on 7/18 .  Pt will
be followed by KOOTE HEALTH .  Wt upon admit=not recorded , wt upon d/c=258lbs.
3. PULM: Stable O2 sat and exercise tolerance on day of d/c. Sputum cx
grew mixed flora. Cont&apos;d Advair , Albuterol , restarted nocturnal CPAP.
Tessalon ordered PRN.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: ATTN PATIENT:
1. if you develop recurrence of chest pain , worsening cough , difficulty
breathing , fever &gt;101 , or any other symptoms that are worrisome to you
call your PCP or return to the ER for re-eval.
2. Keep records of your weight and blood sugars and bring the record to
your follow up appointments.
3. Bring your medications to your f/u cardiology appt for review by your
doctor.
ATTN VNA:
1. please reconcile home meds as pt was unable to clarify her pre-admit
meds during this admit and pt is essentially being discharged home on the
medications that were in the AMH computer system. if there are any
discrepancies w/available home meds in comparison to d/c med list then
notify pt&apos;s PCP.
2. daily CV and Pulm assessment ( including daily weights )
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
ATTN CARDIOLOGY: During f/u eval can you please review daily wts
and check a creatinine. Decide if diuretics and/or Cozaar needs
adjustment.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 5/30/05 and taken
to the operating room where he underwent a heart transplant and
excision of HeartMate LVAD without complication. For further
details , please see the dictated operative note. The patient was
on bypass for 200 minutes with cross clamp time of 77 minutes.
He left the operating room with one atrial wire , one ventricular
wire , three pair of cardio tubes ( Blake drains ) , and two right
pleural tubes ( Blake drains ). AICD was excised from left
clavicular space and a Blake drain was left in the pacer pocket.
The patient was admitted to the Tiesdea Rellla Memorial Hospital ICU on discharge from
the operating room. The patient was extubated on the evening of
postop day 0 without complications. He was brought up on
epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , vasopressin , insulin , and
propofol drips.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1 and
propofol was turned off on arrival to the ICU. The patient was
given Dilaudid IV initially for pain , converted to p.o. Dilaudid.
He was also started on Zoloft on postop day 2 at 75 mg p.o.
daily for his anxiety. He is relatively anxious but his pain has
been well controlled with Dilaudid. He will leave the ICU on
Dilaudid p.o. p.r.n. pain.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought up from the
operating room on epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , and
vasopressin drips. All drips were continued from postop day 1 to
postop day 2. The patient&apos;s cardiac output and index were stable
and his next venous saturations were stable in the 70s on this
combination. Epinephrine was weaned slowly from postop days 2-3.
It was off by postop day 4. Dopamine and vasopressin were also
weaned from postop day 4-5. Hemodynamics remained stable.
Milrinone was decreased to 0.4 from 0.5 on postop day 6. The
patient will leave the ICU on postop day 6 and milrinone per Dr.
Kridler will be weaned at 0.1 per day. The patient has been
hemodynamically stable from a cardiovascular standpoint since
arrival from the operating room. He was started on aspirin 81
daily. Swan was removed prior to discharge from the intensive
care unit on postop day 5 , 11/4/05 .
3. Pulmonary: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1
without complications. The patient remained very wet secondary
to the amount of fluid and products he received in the operating
room. The patient was started on a Lasix drip on postop day 1 ,
which was continued for a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an
hours. Patient with negative 3-4 liters in 24 hours over the
postop days 2-5. Lasix was discontinued on postop day 5 prior to
transfer from the ICU as patient had been diuresing a large
amount and creatinine had risen slightly up to 2.1 from 1.5
preoperatively. Urine output will continue to be monitored with
a goal of negative overall fluid balance , as patient remains wet
on chest x-ray.
4. GI: The patient&apos;s diet was advanced as tolerated. He is
currently eating a regular low-fat , low-cholesterol diet and is
on Nexium. He also remains on vitamins , folate , Colace , and
lactulose. He has still not had a bowel movement prior to
discharge from the intensive care unit.
5. Renal: The patient was aggressively diuresed beginning on
postop day 1 with a Lasix drip. The Lasix drip was adjusted for
a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an hour for several days.
Drip was turned off on postop day 4 for a short period and again
on postop day 5 as urine output remained stable at greater than
200 an hour. Lasix drip is off on postop day 5 prior to transfer
from the intensive care unit. The patient will continue to need
diuresis since he is still wet on chest x-ray. The patient&apos;s
creatine has bumped , however , from 1.5 to 2.1 at this point.
6. Endocrine: The patient was weaned from his insulin drip on
postop day 5. He was continued on the Portland protocol during
his time in the ICU as sugars were greater than 150. The patient
was started on postop day 2 on prednisone 35 p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral
75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which was since increased to 100. At the time
of discharge , patient remained on prednisone 35 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Neoral 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and CellCept 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. per
the transplant team. Cyclosporin levels were followed and doses
were adjusted as needed.
7. Heme: The patient was started on aspirin beginning on postop
day 1. Aspirin is 81 mg p.o. daily.
8. ID: The patient received vancomycin for his chest tube
prophylaxis. Chest tubes removed on 7/18/05 , postop day 4.
Vanco was discontinued after this. Bactrim was also started on
postop day 1 for PCP prophylaxis and Valcyte was started several
days later as the donor heart was CMV positive.
Additional discharge medications and instructions will be
dictated by the PA on the floor when the patient is discharge
home.

prior and now , has had a decompensation of heart failure for
three weeks , abdominal bloating and fatigue. Of note , she is on
clinical trial with implanted PA catheter placed in 2001. She
was seen in the heart failure clinic with systolic blood
pressures of 90 , baselines 110s-120s and baseline heart rate of
100s. She was admitted for diuresis and possible transplant work
up. The patient was unaware of the transplant plans at that
time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient on exam was afebrile , heart
rate in the 90s , blood pressure 110/80 , 100% on room air , JVP of
13 , clear chest , regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , obese
abdomen , liver edge 4 cm below right costal margin , warm and well
perfused with 1+ edema , 2+ DP pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pumpwise , she is unclear trigger for compensation but low ACS
probably at that time. Had diuresed greater than 11 liters on
Lasix drip , Zaroxolyn and dobutamine at 2. Towards the end of
the hospitalization , even if slightly negative , she was changed
to torsemide p.o. Echo read no effusion and an EF of 15%
thrombus versus veg on device. Patient has implanted device
which measures p.o. pressures , again from the clinical trial. We
continued her ACE inhibitor , no beta-blocker given though poor
tolerance. She has continued on that. She had a right heart
cath on 2/12/04 showing very high SVR. Discharge was status
post steroid therapy , off nipride and dobutamine , transplant work
up was nearly complete. She was weaned off nipride with
captopril. Her goal event is slightly negative and patient
seemed to be doing very well.
B. Ischemia wise , she had no evidence for ACF and was not ruled
out for MI.
C. Rhythm-wise , normal sinus rhythm. On tele , she had some PVCs
and nonsustained VT. Caution for ectopy , given dobutamine drip
but no ectopy was seen.
2. ID-wise. PICC was placed on 3/6/04 and Cortef was dc&apos;d.
3. Endocrine-wise. Patient&apos;s diabetes , she was on glipizide and
Regular insulin sliding scale. We started Lantus and this was
dc&apos;d as an outpatient. The patient will follow up with her
primary care doctor to better control her diabetes.
4. FEN: The patient is on cardiac and diabetic diet with fluid
restriction and salt restriction and on a multivitamin.
5. Heme-wise: She was on heparin for thrombus with a PTT goal
of 60-80. She was started on a Coumadin bridge on 3/6/04 and
sent home with Lovenox shots. Her INR was thought to be followed
up by her primary care doctor and Rudolf Tretheway . She lives in
An , so they will both follow up.
6. Musculoskeletal: She is on probenecid for gout status post
Decadron and taper for a gout flare that worsened.
7. Psych-wise: She has depression and anxiety. She is on
Advair and Celexa.
8. Renal-wise: Her creatinine improved from 2 to 1.4 status
post dc of Cozaar and colchicine till 1.1 , I believe , on the day
of discharge.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient was following up again with Dr.
Wuerth and also with Marc Balck within two weeks of her
discharge , also following up with her Coumadin Clinic to allow a
close follow of her INR given anticoagulation for the device she
has in place.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient&apos;s discharge medicines
included , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , 0.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d. of Ativan as well , standing Celexa 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old African-
American gentleman with a complicated
medical history including severe alcoholism and coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure who has at baseline had shortness
of breath , dyspnea on exertion and at times paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea also orthopnea. He has a history of medical nonadherence ,
noncompliance. The patient presented four days prior to admission
on 10 of February to his primary care physician Dr. Dubrey with a cough
chills , but no fever , myalgias , pleuritic chest pain and weight
loss of 9 lb , from 167 to 158 in three months with increased
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient had not been taking his
congestive heart failure/cardiac medications for at least one week.
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia but was
suggestive congestive heart failure. He was also diagnosed with a
probably URI. His congestive heart failure medications were
refilled. A PPD was placed at that time. The patient was not
getting antibiotics.
The patient developed progressive malaise , anorexia , was unable to
get out of bed , poor p.o. He denied any increased alcohol abuse at
that time. There was no abdominal pain per the patient&apos;s
girlfriend but there were complaints that the patient&apos;s mental
status was worsening. He was more lethargic and was found mumbling
by his girlfriend with increased shortness of breath and EMTs were
called who found the patient to be somewhat somnolent but arousable
with a blood glucose of 483 , blood pressure 110 /palp. He was
transferred to the Tabell Aleretsentla Medical Center emergency room.
The emergency room he was alert and oriented times two with
temperature of 89 rectally , blood pressure 120/68 , respiratory rate
28 , O2 of 100% on 100% face mask. An arterial blood gases pH was
7.13 , pO2 326 , pCO2 28. Acetest was positive. Betahydroxy
butyrate of 1.66. serum glucose was negative at 1800 with an anion
gap of 27 , serum sodium 129 , serum potassium 7.6 , BUN 178 and a
creatinine 7.5. The patient was treated with one liter of normal
saline IV over five hours , 20 units of IV insulin two amps of
bicarb , 30 grams of Kayexalate , one amp of calcium gluconate ,
Solu-Cortef 100 mg , ceftriaxone two grams IV. The patient&apos;s mental
status markedly improved after the hydration. The patient was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see problem list above. Also of
note , the patient has a history of severe
alcoholism , denies any preadmission alcohol binges at that time;
but , later admitted to drinking of one to two gallons of gin and
vodka at a time with his friends and also drinking many beers. At
baseline , the patient has some shortness of breath , dyspnea on
exertion , orthopnea and at times paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His
last echo previously the one done on this admission was in 11/27
which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 30% with
anteroseptal HK , posterior lateral HK , inferior AK , 1+ MR and AR
and an ETT MIBI in 5 of August showed IMI , ischemia. However , an echo
repeated during this admission showed an approximate ejection
fraction of 50% with inferior and septal HK only and mild aortic
insufficiency and mitral regurgitation .

100% saturation on 100% facemask. Respiratory rate 28. In
general , the patient was responsive to voice and oriented to
En Hospital , and said 1997. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat exam showed that he was anicteric. Extraocular
movements are intact. Pupils are equal , round , reactive to light , 2
mm. Oropharynx was dry. There was no jugular venous distention
and low lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple. Lungs - Had few
bibasilar crackles , greater on the right. Cardiovascular - Regular

level was 0.8 , tox screen was negative. UA - had 0-1 wbcs , SG of
1.023.
EKG showed ventricular pacing at a rate of 77.
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further treatment evaluation of his
severe metabolic abnormalities. He also by labs he had a
significant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a DKA or
HHNKA. An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that the
patient was likely not in DKA as the patient&apos;s level of
betahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain the
patient&apos;s gap or all his metabolic disturbances. The endocrine
service that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,
hyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.
Initial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negative
including stones. The patient has significant alcohol history and
has been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of his
severe pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was aggressively
hydrated with IV fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began to
correct. He was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failure
and a renal consult was obtained. The patient&apos;s nonoliguric renal
failure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to
hyperosmolar state and ACE inhibitors were felt most likely due to
ATN. A renal ultrasound performed on 1 of July showed no evidence of
gallstones or biliary duct dilatation.
An abdominal CT performed on 7 of July showed grade I pancreatitis with
no evidence of a pseudocyst. The patient&apos;s clinical course was
complicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to a
hypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as the
patient&apos;s CKs began to rise while the patient&apos;s phosphate was still
secondary to the acute renal failure. The patient&apos;s CKs peaked
around 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient&apos;s
renal function with continued hydration improved steadily as his
creatinine and BUN returned to normal. However , in the night of
20 of June the patient&apos;s abdominal pain worsened and there was a
question of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratory
laparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. However , the findings
were not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severe
pancreatitis was noted. On 25 of July and 20 of June the patient did very well
postoperatively back in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He was
started on TPN and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his blood
sugars normalized. On 20 of June the patient&apos;s renal function had also
normalized. The patient by 5 of September had marked decreased abdominal
pain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at his
baseline with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit
to our service on 8 of May on TPN and the following medications:
1. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.
2. Carafate one gram b.i.d.
3. Albuterol two puffs t.i.d.
4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
He is also on TPN , but was being advanced to a clear liquid diet
and seemed to be tolerating it well. He also continued to require
a large amount of insulin through his TPN and also through his
sliding scale. The patient did well and was able to tolerate a
clear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,
solid diet with very low fat.
I will dictate the rest of the patient&apos;s events , assessment and
plan by problem list as follows:
1. GI:
I. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was able to be advanced
to a soft solid diet for the past few days. She has abdominal pain
which had almost resolved and then resumed and the patient
developed a watery diarrhea. It was felt that this could be due to
pancreatic insufficiency versus C. diff colitis and therefore C.
diff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started on
Flagyl and Pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.
The patient&apos;s abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. This prompted
us to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal CT
was obtained. An abdominal CT performed on 30 of March showed
progression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.
There was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. Also noted
was some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of
obstruction. Therefore , the patient was continued to be kept
n.p.o. and TPN was restarted on 25 of April .  The patient has tolerated
this well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal pain
either subjectively or on exam. It does occasionally have mild low
back pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitis
as opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.
II. DIARRHEA: The patient also had diarrhea as noted above.
He has been worked up extensively. His diarrhea has now resolved.
He was C. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with Flagyl
for seven days. All stool studies including Shigella , Salmonella ,
Campylobacter , ova and parasites , Microsporidia have been negative.
His stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is still
pending on discharge. He has been repeatedly guaiac negative. As
noted above his diarrhea has resolved.
III. RESOLVED HEME POSITIVITY: The patient earlier in the
course of his Intensive Care Unit stay had some stools that were
heme positive. They were thought to be due to gastritis. He has
now been on initially , after that has been on Prilosec and now
changed over to ranitidine in his TPN and has had multiple guaiac
negative stools in the past ten days.
IV. SMALL PERIANAL ULCER: The patient was noted to have a
small perianal ulcer. It is felt to be secondary to pressure from
lying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes of
diarrhea which had been going on for days. It is felt that this
should resolve. If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer be
swabbed and sent for HSV.
2. ENDOCRINE:
I. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient&apos;s
pancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.
The patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is now
receiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his TPN. He is
also on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. It
is felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at
this time. As the patient is weaned off his TPN and starts to take
p.o. again , he should be switched over to NPH b.i.d. with regular
insulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. The patient
also has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three
weeks as noted below.
3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestive
heart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout his
stay here. This has not limited him in any way. He has had a good
oxygen saturations. The patient continues to take 40 mg of Lasix
p.o. q.d. On the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg IV
as he has been I&amp;Os positive for the last few days and we noted a
slightly more crackles on his exam. Of note , the patient has a
long history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had been
doing relatively well here. His current medical regimen includes
Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. Both of
these can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. He has
had some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolics
of 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never been
symptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressures
in the 80s and has tolerated this well. He is also maintained on
digoxin 0.375 mg q.d. He is also taking aspirin for his cardiac
regimen.
4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usually
ranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonary
problems. He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt to
be due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is taking
Lasix. He may need some extra doses of Lasix per your directions
the next few days.
5. HEME: The patient&apos;s hematocrit has been low in the high 20s on
two occasions. In both cases always drifting down slowly thought
to be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. He has
been transfused a total of three units while he has been in the
hospital here. Otherwise is hematocrit has been stable for
multiple days so has his platelets. Also of note the patient has
been heme negative from below for more than ten days.
6. RENAL: The patient says his baseline creatinine in which his
acute renal failure has resolved.
7. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: This has also resolved with the patient&apos;s CKs
having normalized over a week ago.
8. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient has remained afebrile , normal
white count for many days. While here he was also presumptively
treated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on his
stool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. The patient&apos;s
temperature curve should be followed given that the patient
continues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing a
phlegmon.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient continues to be on TPN. A
PICC line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will be
removed prior to transfer of the patient. It is our feeling that
the patient should remain on TPN for the next two days and then as
per your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.
diet as tolerated. We feel that the patient deserves another trial
to see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions is
made regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a J-tube for
long term feeding. The patient&apos;s amylase and lipase on the day of
discharge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. These values
continue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominal
pain. This is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.
A GI consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.
It is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again he
should have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hour
before meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Also
the patient should be followed clinically very closely including
his white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signs
and symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon or
pseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. The patient&apos;s TPN should
be continued as noted below.
2. ENDOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY: The patient , as noted above , will
require insulin , both through is TPN and his fingersticks should be
checked every six hours. As noted when the patient is switched
over to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendations
that NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with an
insulin sliding scale at bedtime.
The patient is being transferred to Redist Nalereamer Memorial Hospital on
2 of April in good condition. The patient today denies any abdominal
pain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mild
back pain. His diarrhea has resolved. He is afebrile with a blood
pressure of 120/70 , pulse is 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sat 97 on
room air , with a weight of 69.0 kg. He is comfortable and has had
bibasilar crackles of 1/4 the way up. His abdomen is soft ,
nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. His
extremities are without edema.
On the day of discharge his white count is 8.8 , hematocrit is 36 ,
ADDplatelets of 348. His SMA-7 was within normal limits with a
creatinine of 0.6. His amylase is 47 and his lipase is 160.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged in good condition
to Lakesfic Hospital Medical Center .  His primary care
physician Dr. Littmann is aware of the patient&apos;s discharge and will
continue to follow with his care. The patient also has an
appointment with Dr. Sanislo in the Diabetes Clinic at Longa Ent No on 7 of January at 11 a.m.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Albuterol inhalers two puffs q.i.d.
3. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6. Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7. Magnesium and potassium sliding scale through IVs while being

constantly. He has a modified central solution of 5% aminoacid ,
18% Dextrose , 400 lipids K-calories per day. His aminoacid should
be through a Novamine solution. His acetate is 0% His sodium

potassium 50 mEq per liter , phosphate 10 millimoles per liter.
Trace elements 1 millimoles per day , vitamin K 10 mg q. Mondays ,
MVI 10 ml per day , calcium 94 mg per liter. His insulin in the TPN
should be 45 units per liter of TPN. There should also be
ranitidine 150 mg per liter of TPN. Also in addition to this he
should have 10 mg of Thiamine every Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday and
Sunday , 800 mcg of folate every Monday , Wednesday and Friday and

mg p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d. and Capoten 37.5
mg p.o. q.i.d.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has noted increasing
dyspnea and worsening exercise
tolerance over the past six months. She was admitted to Namen&apos;s General Hospital under the care of Dr. Devera in April of 1992 for
congestive heart failure which resolved with diuresis. Since then
her baseline exercise tolerance is that she is unable to do a full
load of laundry without getting tired , unable to climb a full
flight of steps without getting tired , but does not experience
chest pain. However , today while walking in her sister-in-law&apos;s
house she experienced severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to
her left shoulder and back , which is as great as 10 out of 10 for
severity and lasted for approximately one minute. It was associated
with dyspnea , sweating and nausea but no vomiting. She also
experienced some palpitations. Therefore , she had persistent chest
pressure and dyspnea on arrival at the Amar Portraim Hospital
Emergency Room approximately 20 minutes later , at which time the
pressure and dyspnea were relieved with two sublingual nitrates.
Review of systems is remarkable also for chronic cough increasing
over the last five months , especially since her Capoten dose was
increased. She denies fever , chills , previous episodes of
pneumonia. Of note she was ruled out for active pulmonary
tuberculosis during her admission in Soba Medical Center in September 1992.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination on admission , she is a
pleasant , elderly woman. Her vital signs
reveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular ,
respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with no
orthostatic hypertension. O2 saturation was 99% on 4 liters. Head
and neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence of
adenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. Respiratory system showed
scattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. Cardiovascular
system showed a heart rate of 80 which was regular at full volume
with occasional ectopic beats. There was no evidence of paradoxical
alternates. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to 10 cm above
the angle of Louis&apos; and had a prominent CV wave. All pulses were
present and equal. The cardiac apex was in the sixth left
intercostal space. Midaxillary line was volume overloaded in
character. No thrills or rubs were appreciated , however , there was
dullness to percussion beyond the apex and an S3 gallop was heard
throughout the precordium. The patient had a soft S1 , a III/VI
pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating through to
the left axilla. There was also I/VI MVM which could be brought on
with exercise and lying in the left lateral position. A PI murmur
was also heart similar in character to the MI murmur but heard best
on the left sternal border and radiating up the neck. There was
also an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border II/VI
in intensity and radiating poorly increased with expiration.
Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , nondistended. There was
a 12 cm hepar which was soft and nonpulsatile. No spring was
palpable. No masses were appreciated. Bowel sounds were present ,
and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. A well healed
subumbilical midline scar was evident. Rectal examination showed
no masses , guaiac negative brown stool. Bimanual examination was
deferred at this time. Central nervous system examination was
grossly intact. Extremities showed pulses to be present
bilaterally and equal. There was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory examinations on admission showed a
sodium of 136 , potassium 3.4 , blood urea nitrogen
16 , creatinine 0.8 , and a glucose of 136. White count was 8.2 with
a normal differential. Hematocrit was 41.2 and platelets 247. PT
and PTT were 13.4 and 29.4 respectively. Digoxin level was 2.1.
Chest X ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of both
left and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. The
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minute
with a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acute
ischemia. There was no change as compared with electrocardiograms
from 2/10 .  The initial CPK was 44.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary then the patient is a 54-year-old woman
with cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependent
diabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain and
dyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation.
Actively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) Cardiomegaly of
unclear etiology: last echo done was in 25 of November by Dr. Pernin which
showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and right
ventricular dilatation. 2 ) Chest pressure and substernal chest pain
and dyspnea: The patient was placed on the telemetry floor , was
monitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. The
CK were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence of
electrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. She did have
one run of 4-beat ventricular tachycardia the first 24 hours of
admission. Potassium was replaced in view of the potassium level of
3.4. Initial Digoxin level was 2.1 and Digoxin was held for a
period of 72 hours. She was continued on her Lasix , Captopril and
a sliding scale Nitropaste and was started on one aspirin a day.
3 ) Noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet and
Glucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughout
this admission. 4 ) Status post tuberculosis: In view of her
previous tuberculosis status , a PPD was not performed and the
patient was not ruled out for tuberculosis.
On review of Mrs. Ekis &apos;s history and following a rule out for a
recent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercise
tolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three months
and that she was already on optimal medications. It was thought
that she would benefit from a cardiac transplant evaluation at this
point and Dr. Gerathy was kind enough to consult. A transthoracic
echocardiogram performed on 2 of May showed once again a dilated
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. There was 2+ of
mitral regurgitation with a pulmonary arterial pressure of
approximately 60. There was also 3+ or PR and evidence of
significant left atrial hypertrophy. No ventricular clicks or
thrombosis were seen. However , in view of the dilated
cardiomyopathy , the patient was started on Coumadin therapy. An ETT
O2 uptake test was performed on 2 of May and the patient performed
for 3.38 minutes on a cycle ergometer. She experienced on chest
pain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. The test
was stopped because of shortness of breath. Her O2 uptake was
calculated at 11.4 per kick per minute. In addition her Capoten
therapy was changed from 37.5 q.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. At this point
it became apparent that Mrs. Stuesse had a significant degree of
cardiac dysfunction. A right-sided catheterization performed on
5 of August showed a right atrial pressure of 26 and a pulmonary wedge
pressure of 36. It was decided that she would be an excellent
candidate for cardiac transplantation , and a full cardiac
transplant workup was initiated. The following tests were sent off ,
the results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) One chest X ray
detailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis and
sediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) SMA-7 with CPK , complete with
differential , PT , PTT , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocyte
count and bleeding time; 5 ) HLA typing and antibody screen which
are pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapy
consult; 9 ) Social Service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 )
Gynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking for
bilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests were
performed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid Doppler studies and peripheral
arterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of which
are pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercise
test with O2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinine
and protein; 17 ) HIV antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serum
protein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides ,
immunoglobulins , hepatitis B and C serology , as well as blood
cultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 )
psychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and will
be done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus ,
Ebstein-Barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent;
21 ) TFT and hemoglobin A1C were sent; and 22 ) right heart
catheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to rule
out gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were done
and were within normal limits.
DISPOSITION: At this point the patient will be discharged home in a
stable but guarded condition. She will be followed by
the Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Departments at the Chapstone Hospital .  Her primary attending Dr. Mondelli from Sontriad University Hospitals
( telephone number 990 062-8307 ) will be updated as to her program.
Outstanding consults were be sorted on an outpatient basis and she
will be listed for a cardiac transplant. Her discharge medications
include Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. t.i.d. She will also be sent home on home O2 as required.
Digoxin will be started at 0.1 mg p.o. q d. PT and PTT levels will
be checked q weekly and the patient&apos;s doses changed accordingly.

ADDENDUM
This is an addendum to yesterday&apos;s dictation. The patient on
11/23/2005 had a hematocrit drawn that was 25. The patient was
asymptomatic , but given her risk factors for coronary artery
disease including diabetes and hypertension , we felt that
transfusing her 2 units prior to discharge will be appropriate.
She has received 2 units of blood on the evening of 11/23/2005
and was discharged on 1/1/2005 , felt that no repeat hematocrit
was necessary as she remained asymptomatic and stable. She will
be discharged on 1/1/2005 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is an 82 year old woman with long standing hereditary
angioedema who was admitted with symptoms consistent with an angioedema
flare. Pt reports one day of crampy abdominal pain with associated
bilious vomiting. These symptoms are consistent with her previous
angiodedema flares.
Normally , patient manages her symptoms by increasing her danazol dose
at home , but this time the increase was not enough to stabilize
her symptoms. Thus , she came to the ED to get FFP , which helps with
flares by repleting the missing complement factors.
Pt&apos;s first attack was when she was 10. Pt has had multiple flares this
past year including 6 admissions. She has had 3 tracheostomies in
the past for flares threatening her respiratory system. Her GI
complications include multiple scarring/strictures - is scheduled for a
dilitation with GI next month. She has also had surgery in the past
( 1994 )
She thinks her trigger this admission is multiple stressors involving
the health of many of her family members.

Hospital Course and Plan
82 year old woman with hereditary angioedema admitted with abdominal
flare of her HAE , most likely triggered by stress.
1. HAE: Pt much improved after receiving FFP , benadryl and demerol.
Temporarily increased her danazol , on day of discharge had started on h
er home regimen. Her c1 inh , c4 , c2 were still pending at discharge.
2. ID: Pt was afebrile with no localizing symptoms , but w/ bandemia w/
her normal wbc ( 10% ). Will need monitoring as an outpatient. UA at
discharge was negative.
3.CV: Pt w/ HTN. on Atenolol. Pt w/ Afib. not on coumadin
currently. Unclear why her coumadin was stopped. Should discuss with
her PCP as outpatient.
4. Renal: Cr on admission 1.3. Normalized to 1.1. Likely
pre-renal secondary to dehydration during flare. Monitor as outpatient.
5. GI: Pt with scheduled dilitation of her known sricture next month.
New meds: none
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. call your doctor or return to the ED if you have recurrent symptoms
consistent with your angioedema flare , especially abdominal
discomfort/nausea/vomiting , any shortness of breath or difficulty
breathing
2. call your doctor or return to the ED if you have any heart
palpitations/chest pain
3. Resume your home dose of medications , including vitamin c and e

Discharge Date: 2/30/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: FAILED HEMIARTHROPLASTY , RIGHT HIP.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: CONVERSION OF HEMIARTHROPLASTY TO TOTAL
HIP REPLACEMENT OF RIGHT HIP.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 63-year-old female is status
post right bipolar hemiarthroplasty
in 1992. The patient has a history of arteriovenous malformation.
The patient did well until 4 of July when she heard a large noise with
the feeling of increased pain in the right hip. The patient
underwent a closed reduction in the emergency room and was
subsequently discharged with a hip abduction arthrosis. The
patient presents , however , here for conversion of her right bipolar
to a right total hip replacement.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy. Status
post bipolar hemiarthroplasty in 1992.
Status post breast reduction. Status post left hip revision in
1993 of the femoral component of the left hip. Status post left
femoral nerve exploration in 1993. Status post right total knee
replacement in 1997.
ALLERGIES: With penicillin she gets hives.
MEDICATIONS: None.
HABITS: No tobacco , no alcohol.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the Orthopaedic Floor
postoperatively for pain control and for physical therapy. The
patient rapidly progressed over the next several days and did quite
well. She was ambulating with assistance , partial weightbearing
with physical therapy without difficulty. Her wound is clean , dry ,
and intact with minimal drainage from the old drain site. She was
afebrile throughout her hospital course and required one unit of
blood during her hospital course to maintain her blood count
greater than 30. She otherwise did remarkably well and was quite
comfortable prior to discharge.
Her discharge medications were Percocet 1-2 tabs p.o. q. 4-6 p.r.n.
She was also discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg p.o. q. day and should
maintain Coumadin therapy for six weeks time. The patient should
have a prothrombin time checked biweekly to maintain an INR between
14 and 17. She otherwise did quite well and we are quite pleased
with her progress. We will see her back in the office in six weeks
time for x-rays and follow-up.

Discharge Date: 4/22/1992
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: 1. Right knee osteoarthritis.
PROCEDURE: Total knee replacement.
PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64 year old female who
has worsening pain in her right knee
over many years. X-rays reveal osteoarthritis of the right knee.
She is now admitted for right total knee replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Seizure disorder.
3. Gout. 4. CVA in 1987. Surgery:
Ovarian cyst , benign breast mass removed times two. Medications:
Dyazide; Ecotrin; Allopurinol 300 mg p.o.q. day; Propranolol;
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o.b.i.d.; Sulindac 150 mg p.o.b.i.d.;
Dilantin 100 mg two tabs t.i.d.; Ventolin inhaler two puffs
q.i.d.p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smokes approximately two
packs per week and denies alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: HEENT: Unremarkable. LUNGS: Clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmur , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES:
Mild valgus deformity of the right knee with 2+ crepitus , medial
and lateral joint line tenderness.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the
Orthopedic Service and underwent right
total knee replacement with Kinemax system. She was transferred
to the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively she had a drop
in blood pressure to a systolic of 70 with the epidural in place.
With fluid bolus , her pressure then stabilized.
On the first postoperative night the patient spiked to 103.9 with
a temperature of 99 the following morning. The epidural was
discontinued and a urine culture was sent. The urine revealed 1+
bacteria with 2+ squamous cells and 10 to 15 white blood cells.
Therefore , the Foley was discontinued and the patient given one
dose of gentamicin. A repeat white count revealed white blood
cell count of 12.9. Blood cultures , urine and epidural cultures
remained negative. She was started on CPM and this was continued
psotoperatively with the physical therapist.
On postoperative day three she again spiked to 102.4 and was
complaining of frequent urination and incontinence. Therefore ,
she was started on an empiric course of Bactrim times 48 hours.
Again , blood cultures were performed and these remained negative
at the time of discharge. The patient continued to do fairly
well with physical therapy though her progress was slow. On
postoperative day five her temperature had remained less than
100 degrees for 24 hours and her cultures remained negative. Her
wound remained clean and nonerythematous without discharge. She
had no complaints of shortness of breath or sputum production.
She remained hemodynamically stable.
It was therefore felt she was stable for discharge to the Rehab
Center on 20 of October .  She will require aggressive physical therapy
to increase her range of motion and her ambulation.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. Diet: Regular. Medications:
Same as admission with Percocet one to two p.o.q. 4 to 6 hours
p.r.n. pain. She will also receive one additional day of
treatment with Bactrim.
Followup: The patient will followup with Dr. Eugenio Faries .

Discharge Date: 11/17/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
PROCEDURES: 1. Third and fifth toe amputation with wound
debridement.
2. Lower extremity angiogram.
3. Right transmetatarsal amputation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year old
gentleman with a history of severe
peripheral vascular disease who is status post aorto-bifemoral and
bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass grafting , who originally
presented in August of this year with an ischemic right foot and
gangrenous right great toe and fourth toe. Arteriogram revealed a
popliteal stenosis below his bypass with very poor runoff. The
popliteal artery was angioplastied with good results and
restoration of palpable anterior tibial pulses at the mid calf.
The patient only had moderate perfusion of the right foot , however ,
and presented in August of this year for wound debridement and
fourth toe amputation. The patient re-presents with a poorly
healing fourth toe amputation site and wound cellulitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has poorly controlled insulin dependent
diabetes. He is status post myocardial
infarction in 1993 , 1996 and 1997. He has severe peripheral
vascular disease. He is status post bilateral femoral-popliteal
and bypass graft. He is status post aorto-bifemoral. He has a
history of coronary artery disease. He is status post coronary
artery bypass graft x three vessel. He has a history of congestive
heart failure , history of osteoarthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Zestril 50 mg p.o. q.day , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day , insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. , q.p.m. and insulin Regular
sliding scale.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is afebrile. Temperature was 98.2 ,
blood pressure 100/80 , pulse 85 ,
respirations 16. He had saturation of 98% on room air. In
general , he is a white male in no acute distress. HEENT was
normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were equally reactive to light
and accommodation. Extraocular muscles were intact. Sclerae were
anicteric. There was no lymphadenopathy. Lungs were clear to
auscultation. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , nondistended , with normal active bowel sounds.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Extremities were without clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema. On vascular exam , patient had 3+ bilateral
femoral pulses , 2+ bilateral popliteal pulses. He had biphasic
dopplerable bilateral posterior tibial pulses and a monophasic
dopplerable right dorsalis pedis pulse and no dopplerable left
dorsalis pedis pulse. His right great toe had a black eschar on
the tip. His fourth toe amputation site was with purulent
drainage. His third toe was erythematous and tender to palpation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the vascular service
for wound debridement and IV antibiotics. He was
initially evaluated by the cardiology service and endocrine
service. Patient was cleared by cardiology for the procedure and
was considered well managed medically in regard to his coronary
artery disease. In regard to patient&apos;s diabetes , he was initially
extremely brittle and requiring extensive fine tuning by the
endocrine service who , at the time of discharge , had his blood
sugars repeatedly under 200 , with easily achieved insulin regimen.
The patient was taken to the operating room initially on the 13 of June of
April where he underwent a right third and fifth toe amputation
with wound debridement. At the time of operation , purulent
drainage with necrotic regions of the bases of the third and fifth
toes were found. The wound was left open with packing , with
further plans for more formal TMA after adequate drainage of the
foot. The patient , from the beginning of the hospital course , was
started on IV vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl which he
continued throughout his hospital course. The patient tolerated
this initial wound debridement and toe amputation without incident.
Please see dictated operative report for further details. The
patient underwent an arteriogram on the 30 of August of April which
revealed one vessel runoff via peroneal artery to an irregular
appearing posterior tibial artery. The tibial peroneal trunk and
the proximal peroneal artery were found to have high grade
stenoses. There were numerous collateral vessels to a dorsalis
pedis artery at the level of the ankle. Based on this arteriogram
result and his wound , patient was preop&apos;d for a transmetatarsal
amputation on the 2 of June of April . It was recommended by the
vascular staff that transmetatarsal amputation was the only option
for proximal limb salvage. He was not found to have any
appropriate anatomy for further reconstruction from an arterial
standpoint. The patient was taken to the operating room on the
2 of June of April where he underwent a formal right transmetatarsal
amputation. The patient&apos;s wound was debrided back to the viable
tissue and was closed in a primary fashion. Please see dictated
operative report for further details. Patient tolerated the
procedure well without complications and was transported back to
the PACU and the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively , the
patient has required wound packing to a small portion of the wound
which was left open for drainage. Initially , the wound was
erythematous with minimal to moderate drainage. At the time of
discharge , the wound has become far less erythematous , far less
painful and without any drainage. It is thought at this time that
patient now had three weeks of IV antibiotics and is stable enough
to go home on a p.o. regimen. Patient will be discharged on p.o.
levofloxacin and clindamycin with b.i.d. wound packing by VNA
service. Patient is discharged to home in stable condition with
followup to be early this week with Dr. Deandrade . Patient is also
recommended to call his cardiologist for appointment in 1-2 weeks
and his primary care physician in 1-2 weeks as well.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 14 units q.a.m. and 14 units q.p.m. , CZI

Discharge Date: 1/25/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: GRAM NEGATIVE ROD BACTEREMIA.
PROBLEMS: 1. APLASTIC ANEMIA. 2. HEMOCHROMATOSIS.
CHIEF COMPLAINT/IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 34 year-old woman
with a 22 year history of aplastic
anemia , transfusion dependent for 13 years , complicated by
hemochromatosis , now with gram negative rod bacteremia.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 34 year-old woman
diagnosed with aplastic anemia 22
years ago. The patient never had a potential donor for transplant
and was immediately treated with immunosuppressive therapy for
aplastic anemia using steroids without efficacy. The patient
suffered complications from steroid use , including avascular
necrosis , resulting in bilateral hip replacements as well as
chronic bony damage to her shoulders for which she uses pain
medications. For the past 13 year , the patient has remained
transfusion dependent and requires a few units on packed red blood
cells on an every two week basis and platelet transfusions whenever
she develops epistaxis. In September of 1998 , the patient developed
diabetes mellitus. The patient had already been known to have an
elevated ferratin due to blood transfusions from years previously.
However , when she had been started on Desferal in the past , she
developed a port-a-cath infection and ultimately leakage of
Desferal to the surrounding skin , which resulted in extrusion of
her port-a-cath through her skin. She was therefore off Desferal
for a number of years. The patient presented in mid September of 1998
with a blood glucose in the 500 to 600 range , associated with
polyuria , polydipsia , and a 19 pound weight loss. An abdominal CT
scan was performed at that time , which was consistent with iron
overload. The patient&apos;s ferratin was noted to be the 7 , 000 range.
The patient was begun on Insulin therapy and Desferal 24 hours a
day. A port-a-cath was placed in the patient&apos;s left upper chest.
The patient&apos;s Desferal was given at 2 grams per 24 hours. She had
a gradual decrease in her Insulin requirements by 50%. In April of
1998 , the patient went on vacation to Wark for two weeks.
Toward the end of her stay , she developed an infected port-a-cath
and was readmitted to the Jera Counta in early
April with a port-a-cath infection. At that time , four out of four
blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus aureus. Because of concern
of the long term sequelae of Staphylococcus aureus infection , the
patient was treated with Nafcillin for six weeks. The patient did
well on Nafcillin with resolution of her fevers. The patient was
readmitted to the Biehay Sciencesmot Hospital on October , 1998 to
July , 1998 for a two day history of fevers to 101 associated
with the development of a painful perirectal abscess. The abscess
was assessed and required surgical drainage after a platelet
transfusion to increase the patient&apos;s platelets to 42 , 000. The
patient underwent an incision through the Imount Sheo Bona Medical Center .  By
July , 1998 , the cultures from her abscess grew gram negative
enteric rods , sensitive to Cipro. All of the patient&apos;s blood
cultures were negative. Speciation of the gram negative rods
revealed Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient was discharged home on
Ciprofloxacin , which she took for an additional ten days after
discharge. Since September , 1998 , the patient had been off all
antibiotics and the plan was for Licausi to have another set of blood
cultures drawn to document resolution of all infection prior to the
consideration of putting in a new central access , such as a
Hickman. The patient was seen at the H Care Health
on the day prior to admission and reported that she had been
entirely afebrile without chills. The patient also noted that her
blood sugar was well controlled on a stable regimen of Insulin in
the 24 hours after she was seen in the clinic. Two out of four
blood cultures that were drawn in the clinic revealed gram negative
rods. The patient was therefore asked to return to the Do County Hospital for treatment of gram negative rod bacteremia.

An abdominal CT was performed to determine the source of gram
negative bacteremia , and was unrevealing for the course of
infection. There was a comment made of small liver lesions with a
question of estuta flow phenomenon. An Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained as the patient was completely
asymptomatic and afebrile in the hospital on Levofloxacin.

2 ) ANTITHROMBOCYTE GLOBULIN THERAPY FOR 10
DAYS.
3 ) OTITIS MEDIA.
4 ) SERUM SICKNESS.
5 ) HIV NEGATIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old woman
who has a 15 year history of aplastic
anemia without known cause and history of multiple transfusions
admitted for ATG trial. The patient was diagnosed with aplastic
anemia in 1976 at Phhealt Hospital when admitted for epistaxis ,
unknown workup , unknown cause. Denies drug or chemical exposure or
infection. Hct 30 , platelets 100 , 000 , white cell count ran at
around 4000. She was diagnosed at the time with mild aplastic
anemia. No treatment was given. The patient in past has declined
further treatment and often was found to be non-compliant in the
past. Evidently the patient has an HLA identical brother which was
found out during earlier diagnosis. She has a history of brief
trial of androgen treatment. On 14 of September her white count was 2.5 ,
Hct 19.6 , platelets 5000 , MCV 96 , polys 10 , lymphs 87 which is
similar to baseline but platelets are usually more around 10 , 000.
She is maintained on q three week transfusions without platelets.
She is now admitted for ATGAM therapy. The patient has been noted
to be more compliant with transfusions recently than in the past
and has been requiring them more but this may be secondary to her
increased compliance and increased activity. The patient was in
her usual state of health with a cough secondary to smoking and
white sputum. No headache , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , fever ,
chills , night sweats , dysuria , urine or bowel movement changes. No
history of cauterization for epistaxis. Positive easy
bruisability , gum bleed without trauma , and last episode of
epistaxis on 17 of September which is four days prior to admission which
lasted 45 to 50 minutes. Her last menstrual period was the third
week of 10 of October .  She had no menometrorrhagia and she has nausea with
her menses. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Last month she stopped birth
control pill secondary to non-compliance and uses condoms
otherwise. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for Gravida VI Para III
AB III , twins times one. Last pregnancy in 8 of September , discontinued
secondary to birth abnormality. She has a 15 year history of
aplastic anemia and has been previously tested HIV and HPV
negative. SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for cocaine use , smoking ,
approximately three times a week; alcohol one pint of hard liquor a
week; smoking one half to one pack per day. She lives with her
father , uncle , and three children and occasionally works at
Do Rochealesall Wia
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for an obese pleasant woman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 99.3 , pulse
88 , blood pressure 130/80 , respirations 20. HEENT was notable for
being anicteric , fundi were flat , no adenopathy , JVD , bruits or
increased thyroid. Heart with II/VI systolic ejection murmur at
left sternal border. Lungs were clear. No CVA tenderness. Abdomen
with bowel sounds present , liver 10 cm , no guarding or rebound , no
spleen , mass or kidneys palpable. Extremities non-tender , 1+ edema
at ankle , right ankle more than the left ankle. Neuro exam within
normal limits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission notable for white count 2.4 , Hct
21.7 , MCV 91.8 , platelet count 15 , 000;
differential was polys 7 , bands 1 , lymphs 92. SMA 7 on admission
was sodium 139 , potassium 3.8 , bicarb 22 , glucose 82 , BUN 10 ,
creatinine 0.9 with anion gap 10. LFTs revealed OT 66 , PT 102 , LDH
221 , alk phos 111 , bili 0.3/0.2 , calcium 8.5. Cholesterol 143 ,
triglyceride 113. HIV was negative. HPV was negative. HCV was
negative. Beta HCG was negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient received a 10 day course of ATGAM
complicated by , during the first day , temperature
to 105 with response to holding ATGAM and starting hydrocortisone
and restarting ATGAM. She was afebrile without symptoms until day
nine of ATGAM when a rash became apparent starting on her right
forearm with a rectangular red erythematous maculopapular patch
which later extended over her entire body and it was pruritic. No
involvement of her orpharynx and no respiratory compromise were
ever noted. This may have been partly secondary either to her
ATGAM being turned up on the night of 6 of March by the patient by
accident or also may have been due to Ceftaz and Vanco which was
started on 6 of March for a febrile episode on the eighth day of
ATGAM. She was also noted during the episode of fever to have an
erythematous eardrum , a couple of posterior cervical nodes one
measuring about 1 cm x 2 cm which was tender to palpation , also
some erythema of the right side of her oropharynx. Strep was
negative. The patient was treated with Ceftaz and Vanc for
possible otitis. This was later changed to Augmentin when rash was
thought to be possibly secondary to Ceftaz and then this again was
changed later to po Cipro when she was no longer neutropenic and
her symptoms appeared to be resolving. During the episode of the
rash her urine also changed to a dark coke-colored urine which
contained red blood cells , no casts were noted , however , it was
felt to be consistent with serum sickness and so the patient was
changed from the 40 mg prednisone started for the ATGAM so that she
would be afebrile and to minimize reaction of the ATGAM to IV Solu
Medrol. She responded well to this with urine changing rapidly to
yellow color still with some RBCs on discharge , however , she will
be discharged on 16 mg prednisone po bid and followed up in
Hematology to make sure the rash continues to fade and that her
urine continues to improve. During hospitalization the patient
required periodic transfusions for platelets and packed red blood
cells. She tolerated the packed red blood cell transfusion well ,
however , in general she noted her usual reaction to platelets with
rigors and chills and was given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV at the
same time. Also while using Solu Medrol one night prior to
admission she was given one bag of platelets for which she
developed a little bit of an increased rash which faded rapidly on
stopping the platelets and a platelet blood transfusion reaction
workup was done. The labs on discharge are sodium 135 , potassium
4.8 , BUN 20 , creatinine 1 , LDH 327 , alk phos 263 , magnesium 2.1 ,
calcium 9.4 , white blood cell count 2.4 with 36 polys , 1 band , 55
lymphs , and 8 monos , Hct 27.6 , and platelet count 7000 prior to one
bag of platelets , MCV 88.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Nystatin 5 cc po qid prn , 60
mg prednisone po bid , 1 gm Carafate po qid , calcium
carbonate 2500 mg po tid , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg po bid for 10 days ,
chlorhexadine glucose 15 cc po bid , Benadryl 25 mg po qid prn ,
Monistat cream for question of monoliasis , and Tylenol prn. Please
note that prednisone dosage is to be adjusted in Transfusion
Services on 1 of November as per need. The patient is stable on
discharge. The patient is to return to Transfusion Service on
1 of November and to be followed by Dr. Tony Lowler as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 10/2/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old gravida
5 , para 5 , with history of
postmenopausal bleeding and thickened endometrial stripe by
ultrasound. She had a history of breast cancer status post
lumpectomy , radiotherapy , and Tamoxifen therapy with the Tamoxifen
therapy ongoing over the past four years. She was evaluated and
Pipelle biopsy was unsuccessful and fractional dilation and
curettage revealed scant inactive endometrial tissue. This was in
January of 1994. She had a follow-up endometrial biopsy which showed
quantity not sufficient and there was no further follow-up. All of
this was done outside of our offices. She saw Dr. Lamoreux for
evaluation initially of an irregular cervix on her initial intake
into the Ard Onhill Hospital Medical Center system and this history
was reviewed. She had always had normal Pap smears. Colposcopic
biopsy and endocervical curettage were all negative. She had not
at that point had postmenopausal bleeding for a couple of years.
Her uterus was felt to be overly enlarged and ultrasound showed a
1.9 cm irregular stripe. Pipelle was not possible , due perhaps to
stenosis of the internal os. Therefore she was brought for
fractional dilation and curettage and diagnostic hysteroscopy as an
inpatient because of her history of Coumadin therapy for chronic
atrial fibrillation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease with
mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation , as
well as aortic insufficiency and mild tricuspid insufficiency. She
has had a history of chronic congestive heart failure. Chronic
atrial fibrillation is noted. Breast cancer is noted. There is a
question of a pulmonary edema in 1993.
MEDICATIONS: Tamoxin , Coumadin , Furosemide , Inderal , Lanoxin , Kay
Ciel.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , erythromycin , and Isordil.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke and does not drink.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: Spontaneous vaginal deliveries times five.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Beyond the breast surgery , this included
appendectomy in 1994 , as well as fractional
dilation and curettage in 1994.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Basically unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was preadmitted for switch-over to
heparin therapy. The heparin was then stopped
four hours prior to her surgical procedure which occurred on
4/11/96 . The findings at hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage
included normal appearing endocervical canal , 7.5 cm cavity , and an
approximately 3 x 1 cm endometrial polyp. She had lush
endometrium. The ostia were not easily visualized. The procedure
was very smooth and done under MAC anesthesia with paracervical
block and she had a minimal blood loss. Postoperatively she did
quite well without fever or other problems. She was put back on
her Coumadin such that , on the day of discharge , her INR was
approaching 2.0. She was discharged with plans for follow-up as an
outpatient regarding her Coumadin therapy.

Discharge Date: 2/24/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CHOLECYSTITIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old female
who presented with the sudden onset of
right upper quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain. The pain had
awoken her from sleep and radiated to her right back. She had an
ultrasound two years prior to admission which showed sludge in her
gallbladder with no other abnormalities noted. She had one
episode of bilious vomiting with nausea prior to presentation.
Patient had been given some Demerol with some relief but she had
persistent pain. The last bowel movement was the day prior to
admission and she had an ultrasound on the night of admission which
showed multiple small stones and a gallbladder with sludge and
thickening of the gallbladder wall. HIDA scan showed no filling of
the gallbladder consistent with cholecystitis. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity. CURRENT
MEDICATIONS: Vistaril , Premarin , and Clinoril.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was an
uncomfortable obese white female in moderate
distress. Vital signs were stable and her temperature was 98.6.
SKIN: Normal. HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. CHEST:
Clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm with normal
Sl and S2 with a grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN:
Soft , non-tender , and non-distended except for in the right upper
quadrant where she had right upper quadrant pain and a positive
Murphy&apos;s but no peritoneal signs.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a white count of 7.2 ,
hematocrit of 40.5 , and a normal set of
liver function tests with an amylase of 63.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Teeleah Valley Medical Center , given triple intravenous antibiotics ,
kept NPO , and placed on intravenous hydration. On 17 of January , she
was taken to the Operating Room where she underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy , a cholecystectomy with an
intraoperative cholangiogram , and common bile duct exploration with
T-Tube placement by Dr. Karsh , Dr. Karty , and Dr. Noorani .
Intraoperatively , she was found to have a large inflamed
gallbladder with multiple small cholesterol stones in her
gallbladder and two stones in her common duct. Intraoperatively ,
she was noted to have a short run of an abnormal rhythm with a rate
in the seventies which quickly resolved. Post-operatively , she
continued to remain stable and was transferred to the Recovery Room
and eventually back to the floor. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. On 10/5/9l , she was doing well , had been started on
sips of clear fluids , and was up out of bed voiding on her own. By
10/23/9l , she was tolerating a regular diet. Her wound showed some
erythema but continued to heal well. On 1/30/9l , she had a normal
T-Tube cholangiogram and was clamped.
DISPOSITION: She remained afebrile with no abdominal tenderness
and is discharged to home on 10/27/9l to be followed
up by Dr. Tendick in Clinic.

ATTENDING: SONNEK , AVERY M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Osteoarthritis of the right knee.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Right total knee replacement and left knee
manipulation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 49-year-old man with a
history of right knee pain status post multiple knee surgeries
including left total knee replacement in April 2005 secondary to
osteoarthritis. He now presents with both stiffness of his knee
and also pain and osteoarthritis of the right knee.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Pressure ulcer on the left buttock after
left total knee replacement on 8/21 and obesity.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left total knee replacement on 9/29/05 ,
multiple bilateral knee arthroscopies.
MEDICATIONS: Oxycodone p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a right total knee
replacement and the left knee manipulation on 10/17/05 , and
tolerated the procedure well. The patient&apos;s pain was well
controlled in the postoperative period with a PCA. The patient
was placed on Coumadin and began PT with a CPM. The patient was
made weightbearing as tolerated bilaterally. On postoperative
day 1 , the patient&apos;s pain was well controlled and the patient had
a peripheral nerve catheter femoral site in place as well for
pain control. The patient tolerated sitting to the edge of the
bed with physical therapy. The patient was neurovascularly
intact and the dressing was clean and dry. On postoperative day
2 , the patient&apos;s wound was clean , dry , and intact. The patient

Hospital course:
Generalized pain: She has a history of both rheumatoid arthritis
and fibromyalgia and some symptoms that have been concerning for
Polymyalgia rheumatica. For her acute pain exacerbation , a pain consult
was obtained and recommended using vicodin rather than dilaudid and
neurontin rather that topamax. These changes were made with good effect. A
rheumatology consult was also obtained and
suggested starting prednisone 10mg qd for possible PMR with close
follow up with her rheumatologist Dr. Dambrosi . They also suggested starting
calcium + vitaminD. Her pain improved on the
prednisone and she was seen by physical therapy who suggested
rehab placement for deconditioning and inability to care for herself.
**Renal: During the hospitalization , she developed new acute renal
failure due to decreased PO intake of fluids and continuation of her home
dose of lasix of 160qd which she then stated she had not been taking.
This was due to a pre-renal state and resolved completely with IV fluids.
**Depression: She was continued on her home regimen of elavil , seroquel ,
zoloft , and buspar.
**Diabetes Mellitus: She was continued on her home insulin regimen with
excellent control.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: PLease return if you develop fevers , chills , worsening shortness of
breath.

Discharge Date: 9/2/1990
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55-year-old man with a
history of smoking and a history of a
left sided hemisphere stroke who was normotensive , nondiabetic and
does not have known coronary disease who underwent a right-sided
femoral to popliteal bypass graft in February of 1986 for severe
claudication. This resulted in relief. He was readmitted in October
of 1988 for increase in pain in the calves which began at
ambulation of 30 feet. Angiographic evaluation at that time showed
a thrombosed graft and he was taken to the Operating Room for a
saphenous vein in situ right femoral to right popliteal bypass
graft. This was complicated by wound cellulitis which was
medicated in the appropriate manner and he was therefore
discharged. The patient was readmitted in February of 1988 with
graft stenosis and underwent angioplasty. After this procedure , he
had palpable pulses. He was readmitted in September of 1989 for
angioplasty. He presented at this time with progressive pain and
three months of frank rest pain in the right calf and claudication
of the left calf at 400 yards. He denied dependent rubor pallor or
coldness in the foot but he does have pain paresthesias. He has a
history of chest pain and was evaluated by an exercise tolerance
test in the past and was found not to have coronary artery disease
but was felt to have esophageal dismotility which was demonstrated
on the study. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Esophageal reflux. 2.
Left hemisphere stroke which resulted in residual right
hemiparesis. 3. Anxiety disorder. 4. Chronic low back pain. 5.
Peptic ulcer disease. 6. Herniated nucleus pulposus. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Femoral popliteal bypass graft in 1986. 2.
Femoral popliteal saphenous vein in situ graft in 1988. 3.
Cholecystectomy in 1986. 4. Lysis of adhesions for small bowel
obstruction in 1970 , repeated in 1970 again. 5. Resection of a
herniated nucleus pulposus in 1985. 6. Knee operation in 1974. 7.
Cystoscopy in 1986. MEDICATIONS: On admission included Pepcid ,
40 mg at h.s.; trazodone , 15 mg at h.s.; Carafate , one q.i.d.;
nitroglycerin p.r.n. and Flexeril , 10 mg q eight hours p.r.n. back
pain. ALLERGIES: QUESTION OF PENICILLIN AND QUESTION OF DYE.
HABITS: The patient has smoked one pack per day for 45 years.
Alcohol was none. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noteable for five episodes
of pneumonia. Flaccid urinary bladder and chronic chest discomfort
from esophageal dismotility.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a robust white male
in no acute distress. He had no skin
lesions. No lymphadenopathy. Head and neck exams were noteable
only for partial denture plates. The breasts had no masses or
discharge. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Heart had a regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops. The pulses were
palpable at the carotid and radials and dopplerable at the
popliteals , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft and nontender , nondistended. Bowel sounds were
present. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. There was a
right paramedian scar. Genital examination revealed a normal
uncircumcised phallus with a redundant prepuce. Cord , scrotum ,
testes and external rings were unremarkable. Stool was guaiac
negative. Musculoskeletal examination was otherwise noteable for
scars in the knees and lower back. Neurological examination
revealed a numb right lower extremity with a negative pinprick
examination.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Angiography Suite
on 2/7/90 where multiple segmental narrowings of
the right graft and complete occlusion of the left distal SFA with
distal reconstitution were discovered. He was taken to the
Operating Room by Dr. Dougherty on 7/16/90 where a right reverse
saphenous bypass graft from the in situ vein graft to below the
knee popliteal artery was performed by Dr. Bayani assisted by
Dr. Macgowan and Dr. Horwath . Postoperatively , the patient had
excellent palpable pulses in the foot and he enjoyed an
unremarkable hospital course and was sent home on

June clean coronaries ( stents patent )
********************
Impression and Plan: 59 yo w/ hx of CAD , diastolic dysfunction , OSA ,
p/w hypertensive emergency ( BP 190s in ED ) w/ troponin
leak likely as a result of increased BPs and demand.
Hospital Course by System:
*CV: In ED , BP was 198/109 with HR 98. Pt received given ASA 325 ,
Lopressor 5mg , Morphine 2mg , Nitro SL , Hydral 10mg , Dilaudid. BP
decreased to 120/78. EKG showed new T wave inversions in AVF and V6 with
pseudonormalization of T wave in AVL. CT chest negative for dissection.
Serial troponins were &lt;0.10 , 0.13 , &lt;0.10 , bump likely result of demand
ischemia. As pt&apos;s CP was reproducible on palpation , not likely to be of
cardiac source , somewhat improved with narcotics. Pt maintained on home
regimen , with BP control from 120-160/60-90 in house. Echo showed severe
LVH , EF 50-55% , diastolic dysfunction , basal inferior akinetic , basal
superior dyskinetic , mid-posterior hypokinetic , unchanged from prev. Pt
will follow up with outpatient cardiologist Dr. Dodimead .
*Neuro: Pt described HA and episodes of vision loss in R eye lasting 5-10
minutes , concerning for amaurosis fugax vs atypical migraine vs temporal
arteritis ( had been biopsied for temporal arteritis in 10/5 because of
HA and elevated ESR - neg ). Neuro and Ophtho consulted. Pt described
vision loss as bilateral to consults - less concerning for embolic event.
MRA demonstrated no carotid stenosis or occlusion. ESR was only mildly
elevated at 32. Pt is already on aspirin , Plavix , statin and BP meds for
stroke prevention as per Neuro recs , though they recommended follow up
with outpatient Rheum to w/u temporal arteritis if sx continue. Ophtho
exam demonstrated typical dermoid in L eye ( unrelated to sx ) , retinal exam
showed evidence of PVD but no emboli , consult thought presentation not
consistent with giant cell arteritis , most likely atypical migraine.
*Pulm: Pt maintained on home regimen of Advair for asthma and CPAP at
night for OSA , no exacerbations in the hospital.
*Renal: Cr increased from 1.2 on admission ( baseline 1.0-1.8 , most likely
2/2 to chronic HTN ) to 1.7 on HD #2. Urine lytes demonstrated Na 100 Cl
78 Cr 152.3 ( FeNa 0.56% ) , UA showed 2+ LE. 10-15 WBC , 2+ bast6 , 1+ sq ,
but not treated because pt asymptomatic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: -continue home medication regimen , but increase labetalol to 200
mg twice a day , norvasc to 5 mg twice a day , oxycontin dose to 50 mg
three times a day ( 40 mg home dose + 10 mg prescribed in hospital )
-make appointment to follow up with primary care physician Dr. Edward R Freeland
-follow up with cardiologist Dr. Krull on 5/10 at 2:40 pm ( his office
will call you if an appointment can be made earlier )
-fluid restricted ( 2 L ) and salt restricted ( 2 mg ) diet
-return to hospital if symptoms worsen
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
-continue home regimen , but increased labetalol to 200 mg BID , norvasc to
5 mg BID , oxycontin dose from 40 mg to 50 mg TID
-f/u with cardiologist Dr. Kinzer
-f/u with PCP Dr. Abram Blazina
-consider modification of HTN regimen if pressures not well controlled

consider risk stratification while in house. Cont ASA , BB , ?
statin. Performed serial EKG x 2 and cardiac enzymes x 2. Patient
refused third set and 3rd ekg after explaining risks/benefits.

HCP states patient is at mental baseline for years. Falls originally
thought to be secndary to neuropathy vs new CVA vs hypokalemia. Patient
refused potassium repletion. Continue to follow with PCP.

also half insulin dose as hypoglycemia is likely possibility that
contributes to weakness. INstructed patient to discuss new insulin

Joadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , the
patient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LAD
occlusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right
coronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis ,
inferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of
50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained
V-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three
ventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400
msec. The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed with
quinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea and
vomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. The
patient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developed
dyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. In 1/16 ,
the patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failed
secondary to fatigue. During this ETT , his blood pressure actually
fell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST
depression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was
admitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60%
proximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior
hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an
ejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his
1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. During
his admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass
graft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy
to the proximal descending artery. The patient also underwent an
EP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was no
longer inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenol
infusion. Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until the
day of admission on 3/1 .
On the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness and
palpitations while using the toilet. The patient denied any chest
pain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. EMS was notified ,
and the patient was found to be in V-tach. The patient was taken
to an outside hospital and cardioverted at 100 joules after failing
attempted pharmacologic conversion with Lidocaine , adenosine , and
amiodarone. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was
transferred to the Villecam Medical Center for further evaluation
and possible placement of AICD.
On his admission , the patient was without complaints except for
some mild lower abdominal pain , which the patient attributed to his
known constipation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to GMS Ratroit for further work up of her shortness of
breath and chest pain for rule out of myocardial infarction. The patient
remained pain free throughout her hospital course and denied any
shortness of breath , increased lower extremity swelling , nausea ,
diaphoresis or other complaints. She had three sets of cardiac enzymes
return negative while in house. Her EKG showed evidence of old TWI with
some minimal flattening of T waves in II and V3. She had CXR showing no
acute cardiopulmonary process. She had adeno MIBI done on 12/10 showing no
evidence of EKG changes or symptoms with HR 51-&gt;71 and BP 124-&gt;70.
Final reading showed moderate ischemia in inferiolateral wall in L
circumflex territory with EF 59%. Her cardiologist Dr. Dossous was
called and recommended cath. She had a cardiac catheterization on 10/25 which
showed only distal disease and was not intervened upon. She will continue
with her medical management.
She was noted to have INR of 1.4 and was taking coumadin ?non-compliant at
home. With her history of hypercoaguable disorders , she was started on
lovenox and coumadin 6mg and to continue lovenox for at least 5 days until
INR is therapeutic. She will have VNA come to check her INR in two days and
again next week and then send information to her PCP Dr. Lazzar for further
follow up andrecommendations.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: OK VNA - please draw INR on 6/27/06 and 9/23/2006 . Call INR results
into PCP Dr. Swartzlander 945-505-9820. Goal INR 2-3. Lovenox may be
discontinued when INR is 2-3. If lovenox refills are needed , Contact Dr.
Malahan . Patient should have INR checked every 3 days until she is on a
stable dose of coumadin.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. VNA will draw your blood on Tuesday 9/29
2. Continue taking all of your medications , including coumadin.
3. Take Lovenox injections until told to stop by your doctor.

was stable. She had iron and vitamin B12 deficiency and was started on
supplements. 5 ) Renal: creatinine at BL at
1.6. 6 ) ID: R calcaneal osteo with MRSA ( bx
confirmed ) , planned treatment until 8/22 based on last discharge summary.
Change to vanco for concern of
marrow suppresion of linezolid. ID curbside is to use linezolid ,
and treat anemia w/ PRBC. needs 6 week course from 2/12/05 . Check BCx ,
foot films show no osteomyelitis , sputum cx shows klebsiella , likely
colonizer. Patient repeatedly refused PICC. She also believes
abdominal discomfort largely due to linezolid. Plastics evaluated the
heel and felt was healing nicely. To finish up 6 week course from
2/12/05 , we discharged the patient on linezolid until October , as
patient refused PICC for vanco. 7 ) GI: gastroparesis , giving reglan and
sucralfate. Aggressive bowel regimen. Patient finally responded to
miralax and lactulose , producing large BMs ( KUB showed much stool ) and
relief of abdominal distention and discomfort. 8 ) Pulm: SOB likely 2/2

SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Arbafontpringsalb O Land near her daughter. She
spends most of her time at home. She does not
smoke and does not drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: She was afebrile. Heart rate was 50
and regular. Blood pressure was
140/80. Respiratory rate was 20 , saturation of 98% on room air.
She was a pleasant African American woman lying in bed. She has
her right eye closed. She had a surgical right pupil , with a left
cataract. Her oropharynx was benign , her mucous membranes were
moist. She had no jugular venous distention. There was a question
of soft bilateral carotid bruits. The lungs revealed decreased
breath sound at the left apex , but otherwise was clear to
auscultation. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and
rhythm , there were no murmurs appreciated in the Emergency
Department. The abdomen was soft , without hepatosplenomegaly. In
the extremities , there are incisional scars at the medial calves on
both legs , with 1+ DP pulses bilaterally , her legs were warm , and
there was no edema. On neuro exam , she was alert and oriented x 3 ,
cranial nerves III-XII were grossly normal , and her motor exam was
without focal deficits.
LABORATORIES OF NOTE: Her potassium was 3.8 , her BUN was 39 , and
her creatinine was 1.9 , her baseline
creatinine being anywhere between 1.7 and 2.0. Glucose was 122.
Her troponin on admission was 0.32 , and of note , back in October
she had also been admitted and was noted to have a troponin in the
.3 range. Her CK on this admission was 308 , with an MB fraction of
3.9. Calcium was 9.2 , magnesium was 2.7 , white blood cell count
6.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets 238. Her UA was negative. Her EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , with left axis deviation ,
evidence of LVH , left atrial enlargement , and some T wave
flattening in V4 through 6 and T wave inversion in 1 and L. Her
chest x-ray was without infiltrate or pulmonary arterial
congestion.
In summary , this is a 65-year-old woman with vasculopathy and
extensive coronary artery disease , who presented with sudden
syncope x 1-2 minutes. Given the history , the story was very
concerning for a malignant arrhythmia. She was admitted for
further workup of ischemic or malignant arrhythmia causes of her
syncope.
Her hospital course is summarized by systems: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR:
The patient was placed on the monitor and no definitye symptomatic arrhythmias
were observed. However , because of her demonstrated asymetrically
hypertrophied left ventricle and ergions of inferoposterior scar ,
electrophysiology study was recommended ( see below and addendum ).
The patient was initially admitted with a troponin of
0.32 , which on repeat examination was 0.87. It was
thought to be consistent with a very small non-Q-wave MI. She was
started on heparin for 48 hours. On 10/30/2002 , the patient had an
adenosine MIBI , which showed a moderate size lesion of
inferolateral and a small apical region of reversible ischemic.
She had a cardiac catheterization on 1/9/2002 , which revealed an
80% proximal circumflex lesion which was stented to 0%. She had an
echocardiogram performed on 3/10/2002 , which showed a left atrium of 2.9 cm.
She had asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , with preserved overall
systolic function and an ejection fraction estimated to be 60%. This was
thought to be a potential source of focus for ventricular arrhythmias , and
further supported the decision to go to electrophysiology study.
2. PULMONARY: One of the considerations entertained to explain
the patient&apos;s syncope was a potential pulmonary embolus. Though
she had not been hypoxic on presentation , the sudden nature of the
event , as well as her tachycardia , was felt to warrant further
workup for a PE. She had a D-dimer sent , which came back at &gt;1000.
She later had a VQ scan which was read as low probability. Lower
extremity noninvasive ultrasounds of both legs revealed no
thrombus.
3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus. We continued her morning NPH dose and covered her with
regular insulin sliding scale for the remainder of her
hospitalization. Her sugars were relatively well controlled
throughout.
4. SOCIAL/PSYCH: The patient has a known difficult home
situation , with previous known problems with her son and other
family members. Social Services was involved. They interviewed
the patient and involved a consult to Crest Medical .  At the
time of this dictation , that evaluation is still pending.
The final disposition of the patient is still pending at this time.
I will complete this dictation at the time of discharge , including
the patient&apos;s disposition and disposition medications.

Discharge Date: 7/9/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 35 year old black female ,
gravida I , para l , last menstrual
period 9/7/9l with a chief complaint of menorrhagia and a large
fibroid uterus. Patient had a history of chronic pelvic pain for
the past three years with lower back pain. She has had a history
of known fibroids and at the time of this surgery , was requesting
definitive surgery. She has a history of a heart murmur , was seen
by Cardiology in 9/6 , and cleared with a normal echocardiogram
and no need for SBE prophylaxis. Her EKG was within normal limits
except for sinus tachycardia. The patient is status post a
cesarean section. Other medical problems include that she has
recently diagnosed diabetes and takes Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: She has no allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 96 , her respiratory rate
was l2 , blood pressure ll0/70 , and
temperature was 98.9. She was an obese black female in no acute
distress. HEENT: Negative. BREASTS: Clear without masses.
LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft and non-tender with a
previous midline vertical incision secondary to her previous
cesarean section. PELVIC: She had a fourteen to sixteen week size
fibroid uterus and her adnexa were unable to be evaluated.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Patient had a pre-operative hematocrit of
35.3. Her height was five foot two and
she was l80 pounds.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was taken to the Operating Room on
2/6/9l with a pre-operative diagnosis of
fibroid uterus , pelvic pain , and menorrhagia. Post-operative
diagnosis was same. In addition , there were extensive pelvic
adhesions. Procedure was exploratory laparotomy , lysis of
adhesions , total abdominal hysterectomy , and left
salpingo-oophorectomy. Surgeon was Dr. Vito Hazouri and assistant
was Dr. Gaylord Rollf . Anesthesia was general per endotracheal
tube. Estimated blood loss was 500 cc. There were no
complications. Operative findings included the uterus to be
enlarged at approximately twelve to fourteen weeks in size and
slightly boggy. Both ovaries and tubes were densely adherent to
her pelvic sidewalls and the cul-de-sac. She had adhesions of the
cul-de-sac and rectosigmoid to the posterior portion of the uterus.
She also had omental adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall in
the upper abdomen. Patient&apos;s Pathology Report revealed , of the
uterus , leiomyomata with multiple serosal adhesions with
proliferative endometrium and adenomyosis. The left tube revealed
endometriosis and left ovary hemorrhagic corpus luteum. Her cervix
was noted to have mucinous mucus cyst. Patient had a stable
post-operative course. On post-operative day one , her Foley was
discontinued. She was started on sips of clears and had a low
grade temperature to l00.6. Her hematocrit was 30.4 with a white
count of ll.l and a platelet count of 336. Her urinalysis was
clear. On post-operative day three , she was advanced to a regular
diet. She had a low grade temperature to l00 and was continued on
nebulizers. It was felt her low grade temperature was secondary to
atelectasis. Her urine culture was negative. She had one episode
of vomiting on post-operative day four which was felt to be
secondary to a mild ileus. She had a KUB obtained which was
contained with a post-operative ileus with no dilated loops and few
air fluid levels. On post-operative day five , she was feeling
better. On post-operative day six , she was placed on clears and
was then advanced to a regular diet on post-operative day six. She
is discharged home on post-operative day seven in stable condition
tolerating a regular diet after having had a bowel movement.
DISPOSITION: She will follow-up with Dr. Melvin Highers at VMC .

Discharge Date: 4/11/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE FLARE.
2. BRONCHITIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Peaslee is a 67 year old female
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post CABG , DVT , status post IVC filter placement ,
status post ventricular fibrillation arrest and MI , COPD ,
pneumonia , diverticulitis , and abscess admitted with shortness of
breath , fevers and chills. She was in her usual state of health up
until three days prior to presentation , when she &quot;felt funny.&quot; The
patient was a nonspecific historian and could not give any clear
description of her symptoms.
She , apparently woke up on the morning of admission with fevers ,
chills , shortness of breath , and mild nausea. She was febrile to
102.7. She called CH , and was then taken to the Emergency
Department. In the Emergency Room , she had an O2 sat of 95% on
room air , with a slight desaturation requiring four liters of
oxygen. She had a temperature of 101 , BP 130/70 , and a heart rate
of 120. Of note , she had been recently admitted 7/22/98 to
8/13/99 with a COPD exacerbation. She also has a history of having
been admitted on 11/20 for a COPD flare and bronchitis. She had
recently received a flu shot. No recent travelling or sick
contacts. She currently denies any headaches , sinus pain , nasal
congestion , chest pain , abdominal pain , and shortness of breath.
She complains of mild shortness of breath with nausea and feeling
sick. She also complains of chronic leg pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease; ( 2 ) COPD;
( 3 ) diabetes mellitus; ( 4 ) infrarenal AAA
documented at 4.5 cm in 6/27 ( 5 ) gout; ( 6 ) history of DVT;
( 7 ) arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s.; glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o.
q.d.; K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.; albuterol and Atrovent; Pulmicort 4
puffs b.i.d.; MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.; allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
Neurontin t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Theophylline , which gives her anaphylaxis , and to both
sulfa and dye , which are of unclear significance.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She quit smoking one week prior
to admission. She smoked one pack per day for 50
years. She rarely uses alcohol. She has three grown children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with a history of MI at age 75. Father
with a history of lung cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Elderly female in no apparent
distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temp 99 , pulse 100 ,
BP 130/60 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 96% on two liters. HEENT:
PERRL , EOMI , oropharynx benign , no erythema or exudate. No sinus
tenderness. NECK: Supple , no JVD , no bruits , no lymphadenopathy.
CHEST: Revealed rales at the right base , otherwise no wheezes at
the left. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate , normal S1 , S2 , II/VI
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
positive bowel sounds , soft , diffusely tender , no
hepatosplenomegaly , no masses. EXTREMITIES: Bilateral non-pitting
edema , left greater than right , with mild lower extremity erythema ,
also left greater than right. NEURO: Alert and oriented x3 ,
cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Her left
index and middle finger PIP joints were warm and tender.
LABORATORY DATA: White count 13.4 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 211.
Na 136 , K 4.3 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1. CK 47 ,
troponin 0.14. EKG showed normal sinus tach at 125 beats/minute.
She had a new incomplete right bundle branch block , left atrial
enlargement , no acute ST or T-wave changes. Chest x-ray revealed
question of a right lower lobe infiltrate. This was also
consistent with a mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Sartoris , in the Emergency Department , was
treated with IV cefuroxime. She was subsequently
brought to the floor , and the Medical Team&apos;s assessment decided to
treat her empirically for a right lower lobe pneumonia with
levofloxacin. It was not all that clear that Ms. Bartlett had a
pneumonia , but she was treated for this anyway. She also had a
urine Legionella antigen , which was checked , as well as sputum
cultures which were unremarkable.
From a cardiovascular perspective , Ms. Cheesman ruled out for a
myocardial infarction , but received some Lasix for mild CHF.
During her hospital course , it was noted that her hematocrit
dropped from 33.3 to 28.4. This was mildly concerning given her
history of an infrarenal AAA. It was decided that she should have
an abdominal CT. This was done , and the abdominal aortic aneurysm
has not changed in size or did not reveal any evidence of leaking.
Ms. Villenas quickly improved after being treated with nebulizers.
She was then switched from nebulizers to inhalers and it was
decided that she was well enough to go home. Of note , her right
finger joints were mildly swollen and possibly consistent with a
gouty flare. She was treated initially with Indocin , but then
there was the concern that she could potentially have a GI bleed.
Thus , she was quickly taken off of the Indocin.
Ms. Peteet was discharged in stable condition to follow-up with her
primary care physician. Her discharge medications were as follows:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) albuterol
inhalers; ( 3 ) allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
( 4 ) Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; ( 5 ) Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 6 )
glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 7 ) nitroglycerin SL p.r.n. chest pain;
( 8 ) Afrin 2 sprays intranasally b.i.d.; ( 9 ) MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.;
( 10 ) simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; ( 11 ) Atrovent inhaler q.i.d.;
( 12 ) Neurontin 200 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 13 ) levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q.d. x10 days; ( 14 ) Pulmicort 4 puffs inhaled q.i.d.;
( 15 ) Combivent 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient was to follow-up with Dr. Poitevint .
It was decided that she would require VNA
nursing to provide chest PT 3-4x over the course of the following
week. She is to have a follow-up chest x-ray in several weeks to
reassess the right lower lobe.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Aswegan is a 74-year-old woman ,
recently admitted to the Kimonte on 1/14/05 for CHF
exacerbation and UTI ( Gram-negative rods , Klebsiella ) who
presents to the Vide Tutenoke Rahbrier Healthcare with one day of abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , and decreased ostomy output. The patient has a history
of multiple abdominal surgeries including a total colectomy for
ulcerative colitis with colostomy , ventral hernia repairs in
1998 , 2003 , and 2004 , revision of her colostomy in 1996 , 1997 ,
and 2003. As a result , she has had a chronic left lower quadrant
hernia. The patient denies any recent fevers , chills , melena , or
hematochezia from the ostomy. She has stable dyspnea on exertion
after 12 feet , she uses a walker at home. She denies PND. She
has two-pillow orthopnea. She has had stable lower extremity
edema in the past day and no dysuria. She also has a history of
a dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15 to 20% , MI
20 years ago , diabetes mellitus type 2 , coronary artery disease ,
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.8 to 2. In the emergency room , she was given 2
mg of Dilaudid IV for pain plus another 1 mg IV as well as Zofran
1 mg IV. An NG tube was placed , and hooked to suction , which
drained 1 liter of green fluid that was guaiac negative. CT of
the abdomen and pelvis showed high-grade small-bowel obstruction
with a transition point at the left lower quadrant hernia ,
dilated small-bowel loops , and fat stranding. A second
radiologist per the surgical note said that the transition point
may have actually been distal to the hernia and may have been
located within the pelvis. After surgical evaluation , the
patient was admitted to the floor for conservative medical
management of her small-bowel obstruction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs , temperature
96.4 , pulse 84 , blood pressure 132/70 , respiratory rate 14 , and
sat 97% on room air. The patient was pale , ill appearing with an
NG tube in place. Her cardiac exam revealed an S3 gallop. PMI
was displaced and sustained. Heart rate was regular in rate and
rhythm. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdomen was distended
and tender , no rebound or guarding. The left lower quadrant
hernia was approximately 15 cm in size and reducible. The ostomy
was without any output. Neurological exam revealed no focal
deficits or facial droops.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. GI: The patient presented with a small-bowel obstruction.
The point of transition was thought to be in the pelvis by the
second Radiology opinion , she was kept n.p.o. , NG tube to
suction. SBO resolved on 4/4/05 . Her abdominal exam improved.
Her pain improved. At the time of discharge , her ostomy was
putting out green stool. Lactate levels were followed , with a
peak of 1.4 and then back down to 0.8. The patient was kept on
an IV proton pump inhibitor , then switched to p.o. At the time
of discharge , her diet was being advanced as tolerated. She was
tolerating a mechanical soft diet.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has CHF with an EF of 15 to 20%.
She was gently hydrated during the small-bowel obstruction. Her
digoxin was continued. Her beta-blocker was switched to
Lopressor. Her diuretics were held. Her hydralazine and Isordil
were held as well as her aspirin in the event that she should go
to the operating room. These were added back. At the time of
discharge , she was on Coreg , hydralazine , Isordil , digoxin , and
aspirin at her home doses. Diuretic can be added back for
diuresis , once the patient is taking improved p.o.&apos;s. The
patient had several runs of V-TAC and frequent PVCs on the
monitor. Her electrolytes were corrected for a potassium of 4
and magnesium of 2. She was asymptomatic with these rhythms.
Her heart rate was in the 90s. Her blood pressure was in the
110s/50s-70s at the time of discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient was continued on 15 units of NPH
q.a.m. , 7 units of NPH q.p.m. , as well as a Regular Insulin
sliding scale for very strict glucose control. This regimen
resulted in occasional episodes of hypoglycemia to 33 and 44
respectively. The patient was symptomatic with a blood sugar of
33. She received an amp of D50 and her blood sugar improved. Her
regimen was adjusted at the time of discharge , she was on NPH 8
units subcu q.a.m. and a Regular Insulin sliding scale. Her NPH
should be titrated as her oral intake improves. The patient is
on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis. She was switched
to hydrocortisone 10 mg IV q.8h. She did not require a stressed
dose. She was switched back to her oral dose of prednisone.
4. Renal: The patient&apos;s phenol on presentation was 0.25. Her
creatinine was 2.8 , which was elevated from her baseline after
discharge at Ketchwo of 2.4. Her creatinine rose to 3.3 and
then began to trend down. Her creatinine was 2.4 and then 2.3 on
the day of discharge. Her acute on chronic renal failure was
thought to represent dehydration as well as poor forward flow due
to third spacing and decreased intravascular volumes. Her blood
pressures tended to be on the low side when she was first
admitted. These improved with rehydration to the point where her
home blood pressure medications could be restarted.
5. ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg IV
q.4-8h. and Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8h. for an elevated white count on
admission of 14.65 with 87.3% neutrophils. Her blood cultures
from 6/12/05 were positive , two out of four bottles in 24 hours
for Gram-positive cocci identified as MRSA. She was started on
vancomycin 1 gm IV q.48h. This will need to be continued for a
total of two weeks , start day 6/20/05 , stop day 8/7/06 .
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were started on 7/11/05 , stop date
4/16/06 . The patient remained afebrile and her bands trended
down from a peak of 39 to 3 the day prior to discharge.
6. Rheumatologic: The patient was continued on steroids for
rheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid dependence.
7. Neuro: The patient had episodes of disorientation , likely
due to sundowning two days prior to placement. She required 0.5
mg of IV Haldol for extreme agitation. She also required
trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. for sleep.
8. Physical therapy: The patient was out of bed to chair. She
typically walks with a walker. She will require rehabilitation
for improved coordination and strength.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was on proton pump inhibitor and
Lovenox during the course of her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pending.
The remainder of the dictation will be completed at the time of
discharge.

****************************************
62 y/o woman w/ MRSA UTI.
1 ) UTI: initially rx w/ bactrim but we d/cd this 2/2 elev Cr ,
electrolye abnormalities and switched to vancomycin on which her
symptoms improved. Thus , we had a PICC line inserted so she cou
ld complete a 14 day course of antibiotics for this complicated
MRSA+ UTI. Blood cxs were drawn to r/o bacteremia given her low grade
temps and were neg to date. We also gave her 3 days of pyridium for sx
relief. The patient will hang her own vancomycin at home.
2 ) Renal insufficiency: baseline 50/2.5; checked urine lytes which
suggested patient was dry and we initiated gentle hydration given
her underlying CHF. This and teh blood we gave her have helped her Cr
return to baseline. Renal US normal. She did have hematuria which may h
ave been 2/2 the foley , though she also had some mild urinary retention
and we are suggesting an outpt cystoscopy.
3 )CV: We were holding her ACE + diuretic until her last day of
admission due to her volume status and Cr elev. we monitored her BP
off of these meds which was stable; We continued her coumadin and her
INR was stable. We restarted her ACE and diuretic( but d/cd her on 2mg
qd of bumex instead of 2 bid which she came in on ).
4 ) DM: we continued her home insulin and her FS were well controlled
on this regimen
5 ) Dispo: w/ PICC line and abx for 10 more days. Pt should follow up
with Dr. Schupbach her PCP.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your medications as prescribed and listed on the discharge
papers , including your vancomycin.
Please be sure to contact Dr. Lapinski to set up an appointment.
If you being to re-experience severe burning again with urination or if
you begin to get high fevers , please call your doctor or return to the

Discharge Date: 5/19/2006
ATTENDING: BORGERDING , WESTON M.D.
ADMISSION CONDITION: Stable.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Foley trauma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old male with
hypotension , diabetes , and obesity. He was in his usual state of
health until November , 2006 , when he had a sudden loss of function
of his lower upper extremity and lower right extremity. He was
admitted to Lihiltcat Medical Center Neurology Service , where
an MRI revealed a right internal capsule lacunar stroke. He was
out of the TPA window. As a result , he was treated with aspirin
and statin. An echo showed a normal EF and no evidence of
thrombosis. There was no evidence of a-fib. His hospital
course , however , was complicated with Foley trauma and hematuria
for which he required continuous bladder irrigation. The patient
also developed a UTI by UA , but not a positive culture data. The
patient was seen briefly by Urology , who recommended continued
bladder irrigation and followup. He was then treated with
ceftazidime x3 and the patient was discharged to rehab on November
with a chronic bladder irrigation and urology followup for a UT
urogram.
The patient did fairly well in rehab until the day prior to
admission , which was on November , 2006 , after one day of being
discharged from rehab when , during a physical therapy session ,
the patient accidentally manipulated the Foley catheter causing
increased pain and worsening hematuria. So , then the patient
came to the ED the next day after the patient was already
discharged. The patient came to the ED on November , 2006. The
patient was hemodynamically stable but complained of severe
pelvic pain and received 10 mg of IV morphine , Dilaudid ,
Percocet , Valium and Ativan. The patient then became
increasingly sedated and developed an O2 requirement , and was
eventually on lung non-rebreather. By the time he was admitted
to the medicine floor , the patient was very sedated and difficult
to arouse. ABGs showed a 7.25/71/90 and he received 0.04 mg of
Narcan. He immediately awoke; however , then continued to become
sedated within 30 minutes. As a result , the patient was sent to
ICU on May , 2006. The patient had systolic blood pressure in
the 60s and was given Narcan and IV fluids. However , the
systolic pressure only responded to 90s. The patient also
complained of diffuse abdominal pain. However , KUB showed a
nonspecific bowel gas pattern. The patient was required to
continue Narcan boluses and his ABG started to show improvement.
It was 7.33/56/113 on 100% non-rebreather. During the overnight
ICU stay , the patient did very well. Eventually , the patient was
hemodynamically stable with systolic pressure maintaining very
well over 100 with a JVP over 10. The patient was more awake the
next day after admission to ICU overnight.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM
Cardiovascular: As a result , the patient was hypotensive on the
floor at the beginning due to being over-narcotized in the ED.
Systolic pressure dropped to the lowest in the 60s. However ,
after the ICU stay , as well as boluses with Narcan IV fluids , the
patient&apos;s blood pressure returned to be stable , with systolic
blood pressure above 100. The patient&apos;s echo was also normal the
week before and there were no signs of systolic dysfunction. The
patient was continued on aspirin and statin and , after the ICU
stay , the patient was transferred back to the floor and the
patient&apos;s cardiovascular was stable and the patient&apos;s
antihypertensive regimen was resumed. The patient&apos;s heart rate
was usually maintained between 50 to 67. At times , the patient&apos;s
Lopressor has to be held due to the low heart rate. As a result ,
Lopressor was titrated down from 25 mg to 12.5 mg b.i.d. This
happened during the hospital stay. The patient also resumed back
on his captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d. The patient was admitted to the
floor on telemetry and throughout the 3-4 days prior to
discharge , the patient was stable on the floor and remained
cardiovascularly and hemodynamically stable. The patient was
continued on statin and aspirin.
Pulmonary: The patient has weaned off the non-rebreather after
the stay from ICU and has been satting well between 96-97% on 3-4
liters. The patient&apos;s lungs have remained cleared and the
patient&apos;s Lasix has resumed at 20 mg daily due to the patient
having a negative Lasix of 40 mg daily. The patient was resumed
back to his original regimen upon discharge. The patient has had
minimal crackles during his stay here in the hospital.
Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin and
ceftazidime in the setting of hypotension and concern for
possible sepsis at the beginning. However , due to no growth to
date with the blood cultures , the infectious etiology of
hypotension is unlikely. As a result , antibiotics were not
continued when the patient was transferred back to the floor.
Urology: The patient continued to have hematuria upon admission
to the MICU , likely secondary to Foley trauma. The patient
continued to have chronic continued bladder irrigation for the
following two days after discharge from the MICU. Under the
evaluation by the urologist , the patient does not need chronic
bladder irrigation anymore. The urologist suggested that the
bladder has actually stopped bleeding with clear urine drained.
Of note , the patient was very agitated at one point on the second
day upon discharge from the MICU and pulled the Foley out , which
created a trauma to the bladder neck. However , the bleeding
stopped very quickly and the urologist placed a second Foley into
the bladder without any complications. Urology recommended that
the patient be followed by Dr. Anderson Veley as an outpatient. In
their opinion , the patient does not have any urological symptoms ,
and the patient should have the Foley for the following 4-5
weeks. Per Urology , the patient may not be able to control his
bladder due to the stroke that the patient had the week before ,
so the patient will need chronic Foley for the next 4-5 weeks
until followup with the urologist in the office. The patient&apos;s
hematocrit has been stable at 29 throughout the hospital stay.
Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes and
continued to have NPH and subcutaneous heparin.
Renal: The patient had prerenal azotemia at one point prior to
transfer to the floor due to hypotension. However , the patient&apos;s
creatinine recovered dramatically from 1.5 to 0.7 upon discharge.
The patient also had an obstruction in which the patient was
unable to void , which created a postrenal azotemia at one time ,
but both prerenal and postrenal azotemia have resolved upon
discharge.
Neuro: Mental status intact. The patient has been doing very
throughout the two days prior to discharge. The patient was
alert and oriented x3. However , the patient occasionally
complained about the leg pain from the side in which the patient
has lost motor function. The patient remained to have left
hemiparesis and required 100 mg Neurontin t.i.d. for pain control
regimen. Otherwise , the patient was evaluated by both , will be
followed by Neurology on April , 2006.
Diet: The patient had normal cardiac diet and the patient will
continue on the diet when the patient is discharged to rehab.
Prophylaxis: The patient should resume his Lovenox 40 mg daily
and the patient should have aspirin and Nexium for prophylaxis.
Psychiatry: The patient was given Ambien 10 mg p.o. at bedtime
for sleep and he responded very well with the regimen. The
patient was also given Seroquel for anti-anxiety medication.

Discharge Date: 2/10/1994
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: 1. BRADYARRHYTHMIA.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. SYNCOPE.
PROCEDURES: Pacemaker insertion , 24 of November .
IDENTIFICATION: Sixty year old black female who has a chief
complaint of dizziness and syncope. The source of
history was the patient , who was a moderate historian and the old
chart. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: According to the patient , she
first presented to the medical system in 1989. At that time she
was walking at home and became dizzy. She was taken to Meeville Valley Health in Rhode Island She was told that she had a heart
attack and was placed on a monitor when she was noted to have an
episode of asystole on the monitor. This led to emergent pacer
insertion. After pacer placement , the dizziness never recurred
until a few months ago. This led to hospitalization on May , 1994
at Xas*tu Hospital Medical Center .  She was seen by the pacer service
who interrogated her pacer and found it functioning normally.
However , the pacer lead type ( MECHRONIC 4012 ) is felt to have a
high failure rate , necessitating a new pacer insertion.
Unfortunately , the patient left AMA before the procedure could be
performed.
Today , the patient got out of bed and preceded to the bathroom ,
where she had a normal bowel movement without any symptoms. She
got up from the toilet and while walking back to bed became dizzy
again. She subsequently passed out for an undetermined time.
After waking up she knew exactly where she was and had no
post-ictal symptoms. She fell to the floor , but denies any trauma.
She also denied urinary/fecal incontinence during this episode.
She adamantly denies chest pain , shortness of breath or significant
palpitations. She presented today to the ER for evaluation.
Medications on admission - None. No known drug allergies. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: None. HABITS: No tobacco , no alcohol. SOCIAL
HISTORY: Unemployed , divorced , mother of six children. FAMILY
HISTORY: Positive for hypertension. No seizure disorder in the
family and her mother and two aunts have pacemakers inserted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Morbidly obese black female in
no acute distress without complaints
presently. T 98.3 , blood pressure lying down 120/80 , sitting up
133/82 , heart rate lying down 72 , heart rate sitting up 80 ,
respiratory rate is 16 , O2 sat is 98% on room air. HEENT -
Anicteric. Clear oropharynx. Neck is supple. Lungs are clear.
Back - Without spinal or cvat. Cardiovascular - Regular rate and
rhythm. No jugular venous distention. Normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or
S4 , no murmurs. Carotids with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds , obese , soft , nontender , no
organomegaly. Extremities - No pitting edema. 2+ radial and DP
pulses bilaterally. Neuro - Alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves III-XII are tested and are intact. Sensation is
grossly intact. Motor strength - Normal gait , not tested.
Reflexes are 1-2+ patella and biceps reflexes , symmetrically.
LABORATORY DATA: K 3.9 , mag 2.1 , Hematocrit 38.9. Chest x-ray
is negative. Costophrenic angles were not
visualized well secondary to her large habitus. EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm at 72 , first degree AV block , PR interval of 0.30 ,
left ventricular hypertrophy.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the unit. Her story
was most consistent with an arrhythmia induced
syncope. Considering her history , it was felt that she certainly
had a symptomatic bradycardic episode. Because her current
pacemaker had a very high failure rate , we recommended changing the
pacemaker and the patient agreed. She was placed on the cardiac
monitor without any event over her hospital stay.
As part of her prepacer work-up , she had a right upper extremity
venogram which showed patent vessels on that side. The patient had
a pacemaker insertedon 24 of November in the OR without any complications.
The reason it was done in the OR was because of her large size and
the strength of the table. After pacer insertion , the patient did
very well without any further symptoms of dizziness or syncope. She
was discharged to home the following day in good condition.
DISPOSITION: Discharge medications - Keflex 500 mg q8h for nine
doses , Percocet 1-2 p.o. q6h p.r.n. pain. Follow-up
will be in the Pacemaker Clinic.

Discharge Date: 8/10/2005
ATTENDING: LEIFER , JEFFEREY GRAHAM MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Endocarditis , urinary tract infection.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Mitral regurgitation , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , recurrent UTIs , uterine
prolapse , hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast nodule.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old with a
history of severe mitral regurgitation , history of congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% in 6/8 , chronic
abdominal discomfort , history of recurrent UTIs , and uterine
prolapse , who one week prior to admission developed increased
nausea , decreased appetite , weakness , fatigue and increased low
back pain. No vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. On
presentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septic
shock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted to
the Medical ICU for pressure support.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for heart rate of 94 ,
blood pressure of 80-90/50. Notable for heart exam with regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendo
murmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border
radiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave.
JVP flat. Chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields and
leg basilar crackles. Abdominal exam was benign. Guaiac
negative. Extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS: Blood culture on 10/13
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture on 10/13 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiella
pneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , and
levofloxacin sensitive. TEE on 10/17 Severe mitral
regurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications and
linear density concerning for endocarditis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
IMPRESSION: A 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,
history of CHF , history of recurrent UTI , who presented with
nausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical ICU stay x
2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitral
calcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plus
Klebsiella UTI.
1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with chills and
hypotension and was admitted to the MICU from the ED for
treatment of septic shock. Her mean arterial pressures were kept
above 65 with Levophed. She initially was treated with
levofloxacin and vancomycin to treat Gram-positive cocci
bacteremia and UTI. Blood culture from 5/15 , grew out
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella , ampicillin
resistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. On 1/11 ,
antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h.
and gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. ATEE on 5/29 showed severe mitral
regurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and linear
density concerning for endocarditis. Therefore , a PICC line was
placed on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course of
penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. until 1/3 and two-week
course of gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 .  She will follow
up in the Infectious Disease Clinic with Dr. Ramiro Halcom on
1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was maintained on
aspirin. Lipitor was initially helped for an initial
transaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that at
the time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and she
was restarted on her Lipitor. Pump: The patient has a history
of congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in
6/8 .  She had hypotension , requiring Levophed until 2/5 .  She
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the setting
of fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. She has a
very attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.
Her Lasix and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive. Because
her systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s and
low 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ACE while in the
hospital. It is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatient
physicians will attempt to add the ACE back onto her medical
regimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressure
tolerates. The patient also has a very severe mitral
regurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ACE on
her medication regimen would be beneficial. Rhythm: The patient
was maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinus
rhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg
t.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. at
discharge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70s
and the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. Her
electrolytes were also well repleted.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient had evidence of shock liver
( 4/10 with an ALT of 135 , AST of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of
251 , and T bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. Lipitor was held ,
and was started as a transaminitis resolved. Non-contrast CT of
the abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence of
acute cholecystitis. Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed
the CT findings. Colon cancer is a concern with the patient&apos;s
anemia being new since 5/8 .  Her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,
and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.
She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis. Heme: The patient
had guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her hematocrit was
stable around 33%. She has a microcytic anemia with an MCV of
79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , TIBC of 191 , ferritin is 744 )
suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying iron
deficiency.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a normal random cortisol level of
35.3. She had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on the
Portland protocol in the medical ICU. Hemoglobin A1c , however ,
was 6.5. Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only on
insulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Lovenox and Protonix.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mg
daily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 for a
two-week course , penicillin G potassium 3 million units IV q.4h.
until 1/3 for a six-week course , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , and
Protonix 40 mg daily. The patient has not been restarted on her
home Lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low blood
pressures between the 90s and 100s. It is anticipated that
especially her Lisinopril and her Lasix will be added back on to
her medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. Given that
she was no longer on Lasix , she was also taken potassium
chloride.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation
at Acanmingpeerra Virg Tantblu Medical Center in order to be able to get her antibiotic
therapy. She was discharged on stable condition.
PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP: The patient has been following follow-up
appointments:
1. Stress test in 2/6/05 at 3 p.m.
2. Dr. Gale Montante ( general cardiology ) on 7/10/05 at 10 a.m.
3. Dr. Ed Storti 3/22/05 at 12 p.m.
4. Dr. Stacey Koers ( infectious disease ) 1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
The patient will follow up regarding the success of her
antibiotic therapy. It is also anticipated that her cardiologist
will re-add back on her ACE for better afterload reduction as her
blood pressures tolerates , and potentially we will add her back
on to the Lasix as well. She will require weekly lab draws to
check her electrolytes and CBC while she is on the antibiotics.
CONSULTANTS: Infectious disease , Dr. Rupert Zenon , pager
number 55757.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Abel Guignard .
The patient is full code. Her family is aware of the situation.

Discharge Date: 9/7/2005
ATTENDING: FERRIGNO , CASEY PABLO MD
SERVICE: Cardiology Team VT
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Geoffrey D. Heebsh MD , PHD.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; hypertension;
hypothyroidism; and anxiety.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is an 82-year-old male
with a history of CHF with an EF 10% to 15% who is status post
MI , history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and
hypothyroidism. There is also a question of a history of atrial
fibrillation as well.
In the past 2 months , the patient had complaints of increasing
dyspnea on exertion with being unable to walk from one end of the
room to the other without becoming short of breath; a mild weight
gain of 3 pounds as well; and a stable , 2-pillow orthopnea.
On August , 2005 , the patient awakened from sleep with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath and chest pressure associated with
nausea and vomiting. The patient presented to an outside
hospital emergency department where his blood pressure was
stable , and he was saturating 94% on room air. He was treated
with IV Lopressor and nitroglycerin , sublingual and topical. He
was admitted at that hospital , and Cardiology was consulted who
diagnosed him with a mild CHF by his physical examination. A
chest x-ray was with bibasilar opacities that were more likely
atelectasis. The patient was ruled out for an MI at that
hospital and treated with Lasix at the home doses of Lasix 40 mg
p.o. b.i.d. with stable systolic blood pressures of 100s to 110s.
His course at that hospital was complicated by a nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia through which he was asymptomatic. He
was started on Lovenox b.i.d. for a low EF.
The patient was transferred to the Laismode Hospital
on May , 2005 , for elective placement of an AICD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation , anxiety , CHF with an
EF of 10% to 15% , MI , diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
hypothyroidism , status post cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ,
and a history of probable prostate ??___??.
MEDICATIONS: The patient&apos;s home medications had included Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl 10 mEq q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. ,
Levoxyl 150 mcg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
trazodone 50 mg to 100 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and Ativan 0.5
mg p.r.n.
Transfer medications include digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , levothyroxine
150 mcg q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 20
mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , KCl 10 mEq
p.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and there is a question whether the patient was currently
on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smoking
greater than 20 years ago. He lives with his wife.
FAMILY HSITORY: Both the parents of the patient are with a CAD
in their 70s.
PHYSICAL EXAMIANTION: The patient&apos;s vital signs upon arriving on
the floor; temperature was 94.5 , pulse was 64 , blood pressure was
120/60 , respirations were 20 , and he was saturating 98% on room
air. Examination was remarkable for JVP at his jaw and moist
mucous membranes. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with
frequent ectopy and S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4. The lungs were with a
faint left bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was benign. The
extremities were with no pitting edema but slightly cool
bilaterally. Neurological examination is nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 0.9.
CBC was unremarkable. BNP was 2035. INR was 1.3 , and PTT was
37.4.
Of note , an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital on
July , 2005 , showed an EF of 10% to 15% , moderate left atrial
enlargement , right atrial enlargement , mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation , mild MR and mild TR , and pulmonary artery
pressures of 45.
An ETT myoview performed at the outside hospital showed a large
fixed defect inferiorly and inferolaterally as well as a mild
ischemia in the lateral wall.
EKG at the outside hospital performed on July , 2005 , was with
sinus rhythm; right bundle-branch block with T wave inversion in
V1 through V4; Q waves in II , III , and aVF; first-degree AV
block; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block.
A chest x-ray at the outside hospital on August , 2005 , was with
bibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versus
pneumonia.
Admission EKG here on May , 2005 , was unchanged from the
outside hospital.
Admission chest x-ray on done on May , 2005 , showed
cardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to the
Las Health Network for an elective automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient had no active
ischemia. He does have a history of a myocardial infarction ,
which was inferior in area. His ETT-MIBI was with mild lateral
wall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateral
defect. The patient was continued on aspirin , ACE inhibitor , and
statin and restarted on his beta-blocker. A catheterization was
performed on May , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominant
system and no significant left main or left anterior descending
artery lesions. A left posterior descending artery had an 80%
lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. Ejection fraction
was estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated left
atrium and dilated left ventricle. The patient had elevated
wedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
2. Pump: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
On admission , he was volume overloaded with a BNP of 2035. On
admission , the patient was treated with Lasix , Isordil , ACE
inhibitor , and digoxin. Hydralazine was added. A
catheterization on May , 2005 , demonstrated elevated left
heart-filling pressures. The patient was diuresed subsequently
with more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. The
patient is currently euvolemic on p.o. Lasix to being slightly
dry. Given increased CO2 but a normal BUN and creatinine , we
have changed the patient&apos;s Lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. upon discharge. Given the systolic blood
pressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient&apos;s lisinopril was
changed to 20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is to be followed by VNA
at home to monitor blood pressure.
3. Rhythm: The patient was followed by EP. His admission
electrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with a
question of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degree
arteriovenous block. On October , 2005 , the patient became
suddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degree
arteriovenous block type 1. The patient was asymptomatic
throughout this. Zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put at
the bedside. On August , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back in
normal sinus rhythm. On August , 2005 , a pacemaker with automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiac
resynchronization therapy as well. This was interrogated on June , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. The patient will follow
up with Dr. Valko in EP on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. The
patient is to avoid vigorous activity.
4. Endocrine: The patient is with diabetes mellitus and was
covered with regular insulin sliding scale here. He was advised
to restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upon
discharge. The patients&apos; history of hypothyroidism and thyroid
function test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. He was
continued on levothyroxine at his home dose.
5. Psychiatry: The patient is given trazodone and Ativan q.h.s.
p.r.n. The patient&apos;s mental status was somewhat decreased on the
night of August , 2005 , status post automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He was not oriented to
time. This later resolved by the evening of September , 2005.
6. Genitourinary: The patient was noted to have bloody urine
after receiving heparin during the catheterization thought
secondary to Foley trauma. There were no clots; however , given
significant hematuria , ??___?? Foley was placed and bladder
irrigation was started. Urinalysis was negative. Urine was pink
colored by the night of September , 2005. The Foley was discontinued
due to a leakage. This was not replaced given good urine output ,
continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. The patient&apos;s
hematocrit was stable throughout this.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was given pneumoboots given the new
automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and
hematuria.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aortic valve stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 75-year-old gentleman with a
history of coronary artery disease who is status post CABG in
1983 who has recently experienced unstable angina and was
admitted in April of 2006 to Omill Mang Medical Center Of for
workup and was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.8 and
significant vein graft disease to OM1. The patient received
coronary stents to OM1 and the native circumflex at Palclean Center in April of 2006. Of note , the right coronary artery was
seen to be occluded at that time as was the vein graft to that
coronary. The vein graft to the LAD had been priorly stented and
was noted to be patent. The patient began developing shortness
of breath and symptoms of aortic stenosis , which were complicated
by anemia , which was thought to have developed due to some AV
malformations of the foregut. In view of the patient&apos;s
progressive symptoms , it was decided to proceed with aortic valve
replacement , which was first scheduled for September , but then
rescheduled when the patient was noted to have coughing and
hemoptysis. The patient was treated for pneumonia surgery
rescheduled and he is admitted to Ingfrisdam Rywilf Health
for reoperation aortic valve replacement.

The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following
surgery on Levophed and epinephrine drips. He was noted to be
hypotensive following surgery , which was refractory to pressors
and volume requiring pressor boluses and transient application of
chest compressions and the patient underwent placement of an
intraaortic balloon pump. The balloon pump was weaned and
removed by postoperative day 2 and pressors were weaned by
postoperative day 3. The patient transferred to the Step-Down
Unit later on postoperative day #3 and continued to progress
daily. His diet was advanced to full house diet and was well
tolerated. The patient was started on beta-blockade , aspirin and
statin for his coronary artery disease and a course of
antibiotics was completed for a preoperative urinary tract
infection The patient was followed perioperatively by the
Diabetes Management Service for tight glycemic control. The
patient was weaned off of supplemental oxygen with ongoing
diuresis and he remained in sinus rhythm and saturated well on
room air for the remainder of his stay. The patient&apos;s
preoperative Flomax was restarted following the removal of Foley
catheter. The patient initially had difficulty voiding and then
voided without difficulty. He has been instructed to follow up
with his home neurologist within the next few weeks and earlier
if he has difficulties. The remainder of his postoperative stay
was uncomplicated and he is discharged to Rehab in good condition

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Alex Chumley was brought to the operating room on 1/14/05 where he
underwent an elective reoperation aortic valve replacement with a
23 mm Mosaic valve. Total bypass time was 119 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 69 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was cannulated via the right axillary artery and left femoral
vein. A sternotomy was performed while on coronary pulmonary
bypass without incident. He was found to have a trileaflet
calcified aortic valve , which was excised after transverse
aortotomy. The patient did well intraoperatively , came off
bypass without incident , was brought up to the Intensive Care
Unit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.
Postoperatively , the patient did very well. He was extubated and
transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. He did
receive transfusion of 2 units packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. His Plavix , aspirin and Coumadin was
restarted for his atrial fibrillation. Heath Uren was also found
to have an air leak from his chest tube and also did begin to
have some postoperative confusion on postoperative day #2. His
narcotics were discontinued. His chest tube air leak resolved ,
and the chest tubes were removed without incident. Post-pull
chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax. On postoperative day #3 , the
patient continued with his confusion requiring a sitter.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended to restart his
preoperative benzodiazepine and Haldol in the evening. He was
also seen by the Infectious Disease Service for shingles and
was started on a seven-day course of acyclovir for
post-herpetic neuralgia. He required vigorous diuresis and
pulmonary toilet with Mucomyst and vigorous chest physical
therapy. The patient&apos;s mental status cleared. He no longer
required a sitter. He was screened by rehab and was accepted for
transfer to rehab on postoperative day #11. The patient also
received additionally a unit of packed red blood cells for
hematocrit of 23 with good result. Isaias Sellars was also started on

was subsequently found to have decompensated heart failure and
hyponatremia. The patient was then transferred to Memoff Deelaen&apos;s Hospital for further treatment. At the time of the fall , the
patient was not presyncopal , likely due to possibly feeling weak.
At the hospital , the patient received p.o. Lasix and then IV
Lasix with little success in treating CHF. The patient was found
to have sodium level of 117 , hydrochlorothiazide was then
withheld and the patient was restricted on fluids. Of note , the
patient comes in on Coumadin therapy secondary to having a CVA in
10/5 with no residual symptoms while off Coumadin. The

HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 65-year-old female with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
CHF with EF of 15% and on a biventricular pacer , ICD , diabetes ,
obesity , admitted from outside hospital for treatment of
hyponatremia and decompensated heart failure.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensated
heart failure. As a result , the patient was immediately started
on diuretics with torsemide IV 100 mg twice a day with a goal of
-1 to -2 liters daily. Daily weights and strict I &amp; Os were
monitored daily. The patient was also placed on 1 liter free
water restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. Digoxin levels
were shown to be in normal range. The patient was continued on
digoxin , Isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient&apos;s
hyponatremia. Over the hospital course , the patient&apos;s
hyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in to
the 130s. The patient continued to diurese well initially with a
weight of 83.5 kilograms. At the time of discharge , the
patient&apos;s weight was approximately 273 kilograms. The patient
also continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.
Subjectively , the patient felt better. Zestril was also slowly
added to patient&apos;s CHF regimen. At the time of discharge ,
Zestril 10 mg per day was added. A beta-blocker was also added ,
specifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg once
daily was also added to the regimen. In terms of diuresis
initially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and at
one point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was not
responding to diuretics. Eventually the patient was transitioned
back to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
Echocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitral
regurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venous
system. As a result , there was consideration and discussion
about mitral valve replacement. The patient is amenable to
procedure performed by Dr. Mcgrue This will be discussed and
coordinated by his office and him. This will be a percutaneous
procedure possibly.
The patient&apos;s electrolytes were monitored twice daily as the
patient was actively being diuresed. Electrolytes were repleted
p.r.n.
B. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. However , the
patient&apos;s ICD and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towards
end of life and required replacement. As a result , although not
urgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer was
replaced by Dr. Neuse on 4/20/05. The patient tolerated the
procedure very well with no complications. The patient&apos;s ICD
pocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or other
complications. The patient is stable and new ICD/pacer is
functioning properly. No signs of bleeding or infection.
C. Ischemia: There are no active issues. EKGs demonstrated no
signs of cardiac ischemia. The patient was chest pain free
throughout the hospitalization.
2. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s home regimen was held and the
patient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after meals
and at bedtime. Fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.
Fingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.
3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. The patient was also
checked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesium
and potassium scale. Sodium was also monitored as the patient
was initially admitted for hyponatremia. As a result , all
thiazides were held.
4. Hematology: The patient had a home dose of Coumadin 5 mg
Monday , Wednesday , Friday. The patient&apos;s regimen was continued
as inpatient and was slightly modified eventually to
approximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. INR was maintained
therapeutic throughout the hospitalization. ICD replacement
procedure per Dr. Bjella The patient was continued with the
foal INR between 2.0 to 2.5.
5. Psyche/Neuro: Continued patient&apos;s home regimen of Xanax ,
Neurontin and pain medication to control chronic back pain.
6. Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis , the patient was on Coumadin
with therapeutic INR. For GI prophylaxis , the patient was placed
on Nexium.
Physical therapy consult was also called to evaluate the
patient&apos;s functional status. The patient also underwent regular
physical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.
ID: The patient&apos;s UA demonstrated possible evidence for urinary
tract infection. This may also have contributed to patient&apos;s
decompensated heart failure and also initial complaints of
feeling weak. Urine culture demonstrated that the patient had
citrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. As a result ,
the patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. The
patient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistant
to gentamicin. The patient after treatment was taken off contact
isolation. The patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stable
with no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughout
hospitalization. Subsequent UA demonstrated evidence that
urinary tract infection was adequately treated.
DISPOSITION:
The patient to follow up with home cardiologist within one to two
weeks. After discharge , the patient will also follow up with Dr.
Iturbe to discuss further treatment of mitral valve
regurgitation. After Coumadin follow up and INR blood draws , the
patient will follow up with primary care doctor.

ATTENDING: KEVIN DEPIPPO MD
PRIMARY MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSES:
Morbid obesity , hypothyroidism , hypertension , history of poor
adherence to medical regimen.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with medical history as
mentioned above and history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with her
last echocardiogram in 6/22 showing ejection fraction of 35-45%.
She presents with approximately 1.5 weeks of increasing
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The patient denies
chest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sore
throat and a cough for approximately one week. The cough is
productive of clear frothy sputum. The patient reports
compliance with most of her medicines but states that she is not
taking Synthroid and lisinopril because these medications make
her feel bad. She also reports eating submarine sandwiches for
the past week secondary to difficulty shopping and doing her
cooking at home. She does not measure her daily weights. She
states that in addition to the Synthroid and lisinopril , she is
unsure of her other medical regimen as she has run out of some of
her medicines at home.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As above.
ALLERGIES:
Ampicillin causes a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has two adult children at home and reports that she
drinks approximately 1/2-1 pint of ethanol over 2-3 days and
binges that occur approximately two times per month.
ADMISSION DATA:
Vital signs: Temperature 97 , pulse 76 , blood pressure 150s/80s.
note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of
200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuff
size. Oxygen saturation 94% on room air. In general , the
patient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowly
responsive to questions with frequent staring episodes. HEENT
exam was significant for mild pharyngeal erythema without
exudates. Neck exam was significant for no lymphadenopathy.
Jugular venous pressure was elevated although it is difficult to
assess secondary to body habitus. Lungs showed clear breath
sounds although a few crackles were present at the left base.
Abdomen was morbidly obese but did have active bowel sounds and
was nontender. Extremities showed significant subcutaneous fatty
tissue , however , there was no pitting edema. Extremities were
warm throughout. Dermatologic exam was significant for dry skin
and thin eyebrows. Neuro exam revealed 3+ biceps reflexes
bilaterally. There was a question of slow relaxation phase.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary redistribution. EKG was
unchanged from prior , and showed normal sinus rhythm with a first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , left ventricular
hypertrophy with poor R-wave progression and nonspecific T-wave
abnormalities.
Laboratory values on admission was significant for creatinine of
0.8 , D-dimer was negative at 306 , BNP 2. White blood cell 6.9 ,
hematocrit 43.6 , platelets 170 , 000 , magnesium 1.7 , potassium 3.2 ,
INR 0.9 , PTT 29.3.
INITIAL IMPRESSION:
This is a 58-year-old woman with morbid obesity , dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypothyroidism in the setting of poor medical
compliance , admitted with likely multifactorial dyspnea on
exertion and mild congestive heart failure and decompensation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient presented with an elevated JVP in the setting
of a negative BNP. However the clinical exam was more consistent
with mild failure and the patient was diuresed with 80 mg of IV
Lasix. She responded to this dose with good urine output and
stable renal function test. However , secondary to stress
incontinence and difficulty measuring JVP , the patient was
slightly over diuresed while inhouse resulting in an increasing
BUN to creatinine ratio. On her final day of her
hospitalization , all diuretics were held and the patient was
discharged on her usual regimen of diuretics including Lasix 80
mg once per day. The patient had been noncompliant with her
lisinopril secondary to throat symptoms and reportedly some
lightheadedness. Therefore she was changed to Cozaar 50 mg at
the time of discharge. The patient&apos;s discharge weight was 141.5
kg and this was estimated to be dry weight for the patient at
this time.
Rhythm: The patient had first degree AV block that was stable
from old EKGs. She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospital stay. There were no significant events on telemetry
during this hospitalization.
Ischemia: Rule out MI protocol was initiated in the ED secondary
to vague symptoms. This was continued and the patient ruled out
with serial negative cardiac enzymes x 3. there was no
suggestion of ischemic by ECG criteria as well.
2. Endocrine: The patient has a long history of noncompliance
with her thyroid hormone replacement and was clearly hypothyroid
on this admission. However , secondary to difficulty with blood
draws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtained
on this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in the
near future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking her
thyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functional
status in addition to her cardiomyopathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium chloride
20 mEq p.o. q.d. , Prozac 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs
aerosol as needed , levothyroxine 225 mcg p.o. q.d. , multivitamin tablet
p.o. q.d. , Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Flonase 1-2 puffs in the
nose twice a day , Advair Diskus one puff twice a day , Aldactone
one tablet p.o. q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOWUP PLANS:
The patient will have a followup in SNOWEST HOSPITAL clinic with her primary
care provider , the day following discharge , since Wednesday
8/6/05. at this time , routine chem-7 can be obtained to
evaluate for improvement in renal function and electrolyte
status. The patient will followup with her cardiologist , Dr.
Roik at her regularly scheduled intervals. Tests pending at the
time of discharge , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram
performed which is pending at the time of this dictation. The
patient is discharged to home with services in good condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Barriger is a 73-year-old gentleman who is a restrained driver
in a single car motor vehicle collision , in which the car went
off the road at a moderate rate of speed ( approximately 45 miles
an hour ) , and struck a telephone pole. There are no skin marks
noted at the scene. There was airbag deployment , and the patient
was wearing a seatbelt. The patient reports feeling &quot;fine&quot; prior
to the motor vehicle collision. However , he has no recollection
of the motor vehicle collision itself , and the next thing he
remembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed , and
being in severe pain. He does remember EMS arriving.
Upon arrival of the EMS , he was found to have a heart rate of 30
in a third-degree AV block. The patient denies any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehicle
collision. He also denies any fevers , chills , night sweats ,
shortness of breath , headaches or visual changes either before or
after. He had no recent changes in any doses of his medications.
He was also complaining of knee pain.
ED COURSE: In the Emergency Department , he was seen by the
Trauma Team. A full dictation of the Emergency Department
courses has been completed. Please see the computer for further
details of this dictation. However , in brief , he had numerous
CAT scans performed while in the Emergency Department. These
included a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis , head , and chest.
There was also a CT of the cervicothoracic and lumbar spine , with
reconstructions performed. As well as plain x-rays films of the
lower extremity as well a pelvis , C-spine , and chest. Of
significance , the plain films of the knee were negative. The CAT
scan of the chest demonstrated a right frontal periventricular
hypodensity , which was thought to represent a subacute infarct.
He was subsequently admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down Floor. He
was seen by the Neurology Service ( Dr. Orban , who is the
Neurology resident ) , who initially saw him.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for myocardial infarction , eight years ago. He
received cardiac stents at that time.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Diabetes.
5. Renal cyst.
6. Cataract.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for coronary stenting; two were placed eight
years ago during his MI , and he had an additional two stents
placed in September of 2004.
2. Cataract removal.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Glyburide 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
4. Zocor 80 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
6. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day.
7. Isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:
Blood pressure of 123/51 , heart rate of 48 , respiratory rate of
16. General appearance: He is a well-developed , well-nourished ,
and well-hydrated male , in mildly acute distress. HEENT:
Normocephalic and atraumatic. Extraocular motions are intact.
Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation
at 4 mm. The conjunctivae are pink and the sclera is anicteric.
The oropharynx is significant for a slight bite mark on the
tongue , without any active bleeding. There are moist mucosal
membranes. The neck is supple , and there is no midline
tenderness. There is no JVD. The chest is clear to
auscultation. There is tenderness over the right ribs , as well
as mild sternal tenderness. The heart is regular rhythm ,
although markedly bradycardiac. The abdomen is soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. There are good bowel sounds in all four
quadrants. There is no CVA tenderness. The pelvis is stable to
rock. Extremities: There is tenderness in the abrasions over
the left knee. The left knee is in an immobilizer , at the time
of admission to the floor. He has full range of motion in
ankles , shoulders , and elbows bilaterally. There is decreased
range of motion in the left knee. There is no bony tenderness
along any of the long bones of the upper or lower extremities ,
with exception of the knee. Peripheral vascular , dorsalis pedis ,
posterior , tibial , and radial pulses are all equal bilaterally.
Neuro exam: He is awake , alert , and oriented x3. Cranial nerves
II-XII are intact. Motor is 5/5 in the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally. Sensation is equal bilaterally , in the
upper extremities , lower extremities , and face. There is no
dysmetria or dysarthria. Finger-to-nose is fast and accurate
bilaterally. There is no drift. Skin is warm , dry , and
well-perfused.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:
CT C-spine negative. CT head shows a right frontal subacute
infarct. CT chest shows anterior fifth rib fractures
bilaterally. There was also some supraclavicular stranding along
the left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. CT of the
abdomen and pelvis is negative , except for a ruptured renal cyst.
He was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without
any diverticulitis. The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines
also demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally
noted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. CT of the
chest demonstrated the rib fractures , but was otherwise negative.
Laboratory , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate
25 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 185 , and anion gap is 10 , AST
and ALT are 20 and 25 respectively. Alkaline phosphatase is 80.
Lipase is 51. Calcium is 8.8 , the albumin is 4.6 , the CK is 89 ,
CKMB is 3.6 , and troponin was less than assay. His serum
toxicology screen was negative for aspirin , Tylenol ,
benzodiazepine , barbiturates , and tricyclics. Urine drug screen
is also negative. PT , PTT , and INR were 13 , 25.8 , and 0.9
respectively. CBC was significant for white count of 12.0 ,
hemoglobin and hematocrit were 14.6 and 42.2 , and platelets are
250. Urinalysis was negative.
Review of the prehospital EKG demonstrated a complete
( third-degree ) heart block. However , EKG done immediately upon
admission to the Trauma Bay demonstrated a bifascicular block ,
with a rate in the 40s.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: He was admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down
Unit. He had Zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , and
atropine remained at his bedside. He also had an additional Zoll
pacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,
however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic
with his bifascicular block. He had serial enzymes , which were
performed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. He went
to the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery
disease. Please see the dictated cardiology reports for the
findings of the Cath Lab. It was felt , however , this was
unchanged from prior studies. He also went to the
Electrophysiology Lab. They were unable to induce any
ventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during the
prolonged EP studies. He had a pacemaker inserted. The
pacemaker was followed by the Electrophysiology Service , and was
found to be working adequately. The attending was Dr. Matt Duropan ,
with the Electrophysiology Service. Dr. Caires with the
Cardiology Service saw him and was attending on record.
2. Neurology: He was seen by the Neurology Service. So , this
was under Dr. Edgardo Mccorison , the attending neurologist on the
case. He had an MRI/MRA performed of his head and neck. The
diffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any
abnormality. There was a region of increase signal intensity on
the T2 and FLAIR images , involving the vasoganglion , extending
the corona radiata. Therefore , given the fact that signal was
seen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was
felt that this was at least 10 days old. Therefore , this was not
felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle
collision. It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was
not previously detected. Given the fact that the patient
remained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and
radiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10
days old , and this was not further addressed. An MRA of his head
and neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. The
MRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left
bifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.
The right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,
however , could not be completed excluded. Given artifact , this
could be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex of
the carotid arteries.
3. Musculoskeletal: He was seen by the Orthopedic Service in
the Emergency Department at the time of the trauma , he ultimately
had an MRI that was performed of his knee. This showed tears of
the medial and lateral menisci. There was no evidence of
fracture. He remained in a knee immobilizer. He saw Physical
Therapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.
With the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute
intervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports
Medicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. In addition ,
he was noted to have several rib fractures. The rib fractures
were felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complain
of some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. However , he
adamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon
inspiring. It was therefore felt that given the negative enzymes
and the negative Cath , and the known rib fractures that the chest
pain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. This pain
was well controlled with the combination of Dilaudid and
oxycodone. He was encouraged to take several deep breaths per
hour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.
4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute
infection. Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the
last two days of admission. It was felt that this probably
represented stress , given all the recent procedures that were
done , including the catheterization and the electrophysiology
studies , rather than A2 infection. The chest x-ray was performed
on the 25th , which demonstrated no infiltrate. This was reviewed
with an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.
Otherwise , it was essentially negative. In addition , a repeat
urinalysis was performed. The results are pending at the time of
dictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient&apos;s
discharge from the hospital. The patient appears well , and
states that he is feeling at his best since the accident.
However , further workup for his white count is not performed at
the present time , however , the patient is informed , as the No Hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient
seem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be
reevaluated by a physician.
5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any
difficulty. He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was continued on his Zocor
throughout the hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: He was initially treated with Lovenox 40 mg
sub-Q. q. day for a prophylaxis against DVTs. He is also on
aspirin and Plavix for secondary cardiac and neurological
prophylaxis. The Lovenox is discontinued , at the request of the
Electrophysiology Service on the 24th.
8. Endocrine: Given the numerous contrast studies , initially
his metformin was held. However , he was later restarted on this.
In addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered with
sliding scale insulin. His blood sugar was never any significant
problem during his hospitalization.
9. Disposition: The patient will be going to Missp Medical Center , in
stable condition. At the Rehab , he will continue to get physical
therapy , which he has received in the hospital. It was felt that
a short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him to
go back living independently again. He will be discharged to the
Rehab in stable condition.

week. Appointment with Dr. Mittman is in 3 weeks.
ADDENDUM:
Mr. Flentge had this pacemaker placed and was recovering
uneventfully. However , it was noted that he started having
increasing white count. It was felt this was perhaps due to a
mild urine infection and was started on Levaquin. However , he
started the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. At
this time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. The knee was
obviously a concern for possible infection. His knee was warm ,
was tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateral
side. As a result , the Orthopedic Service was again consulted.
An arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry
tap; no fluid was able to be obtained. The subsequent day , he
was complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned in
the 99 with a CRP of 190. The EP Service again evaluated the
patient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear
infection from the pacer site. He continued to have no erythema
or tenderness around the pacer site. His chest x-ray was
essentially unremarkable. The next day ( 10/9/05 ) , he was seen
by the Rheumatology Service , under Dr. Burris who also felt this
was most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic in
nature , with a hematoma. He was asked to seen by the Infectious
Disease Service , under Dr. Ferlic and Lou Marzinske
He was started on Ancef 1 gm q.8h. A PICC line will be placed
later today on the 5/15/05 and he will be discharged to rehab.
Of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on the
Ancef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into the
approximately 10000 range. He will continue to get IV Ancef
q.8h. for an additional 12 days. New consultants on the case ,
again Dr. Hempe and Dr. Bradford Mcguigan with Infectious
Disease , Dr Borde and Dr. Frances Thackston with Orthopedics and Dr.
Gangwer with Rheumatology.

INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Wamo Hospital Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Beitz is a 74-year-old female
with congestive heart failure , aortic stenosis , obesity ,
hypoventilation syndrome on BiPAP at night , diabetes who presents
from rehabilitation with a 12 kg weight gain since the end of
October 2006. Her last admission to Y Health Center was complicated by a pCO2 of 80 requiring an ICU stay
and noninvasive ventilation. Moreover , the patient had a
gastrointestinal bleed and hematocrit to a level of 24. GI
consultant felt that due to the patient&apos;s comorbidities and
difficulty intubating the patient , she would not be a candidate
for either colonoscopy or EGD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.2-1.7 ).
2. Crohn&apos;s in remission.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Aortic stenosis.
6. Restrictive lung disease likely secondary to obesity.
7. Diabetes.
8. Arthritis.
9. Spinal stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Right mastectomy.
2. Two knee replacements.
3. Two laminectomies.
4. Gallbladder removal.
5. Exploratory laparotomy for chronic abdominal pain without
findings.
6. D&amp;C.
ALLERGIES:
1. Heparin ( heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ).
2. Aspirin.
3. Demerol.
4. Codeine.
5. Dilaudid.
6. Ciprofloxacin.
7. Macrodantin.
8. Penicillin.
PREVIOUS STUDIES:
1. Echocardiogram 7/7/2005: Ejection fraction 65-70% , mild
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , aortic valve was
thickened , stenotic , peak gradient 58 ( mean 33 ) , AVA 0.74 , mild
mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation
( regurgitant velocity 3.2 m/s , pulmonary artery systolic pressure
40+ right atrial pressure ) , trace-to-mild pulmonic regurgitation.
2. Pulmonary function test 2/8/2006: FVC 31% , FEV1 23
percent , FEV1/FVC 77%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , 5/25/2006 , the patient&apos;s weight on admission was
130 kg. Her vital signs are as follows , temperature 95.8 , pulse
67 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 126/Doppler , the
patient had respiratory rate of 20 and an O2 saturation 95% on 4
liters. In general , the patient was in no acute distress ,
speaking in full sentences. Examination of the neck revealed JVP
to the ear , weak/weight carotid upstrokes , no bruits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with an
S1 and weak S2. A 4/6 crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur was
heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to the
carotids. Lung examination revealed crackles that heard at the
way up bilaterally with decreased breath sounds throughout. The
patient&apos;s abdomen was obese , but soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed a parvus at tardus. Lower extremity
pulses could not be palpated due to edema. The patient had 4+
lower extremity edema. Examination of the left shin showed
erythema , pain , swelling with a 2 x 2 cm ulcer on the left
anterior shin. The ulcer appeared clean , dry and intact with no
drainage.
STUDIES AT OUAH:
1. EKG on 5/25/2006 showed atrial fibrillation at 63 beats per
minute with a normal axis and poor R-wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient presented in gross volume overload: We attempted
to diurese the patient with intravenous torsemide. Gradually ,
the dose of torsemide was increased from 100 twice a day to 200
twice a day. At the time of this dictation; however , the
patient&apos;s weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. Her admission
weight on 7/15/2006 was 130 kg. However , this weight was
recorded in the bed ( not standing ). Her first standing weight
was recorded on 8/19/2006 at 125 kg. Her lower extremity edema
only mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , the
patient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to do
prior to admission. During this diuresis , the patient&apos;s
potassium was repleted twice a day. She was also maintained on
Aldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated CO2 levels ). The
patient&apos;s lipid profile was measured during this hospitalization
and she had an LDL of 64. She was maintained on Zocor. Aspirin
cannot be administered due to the patient&apos;s drug allergy profile.
From a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation during this hospitalization through 5/18/2006. She
was not anticoagulation , given her history of HIT and history of
gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was maintained on BiPAP and Flonase
throughout her hospitalization. Her mental status was monitored
closely given her previous MICU stay during her last admission
for an elevated pCO2. However , the patient was alert and
oriented x3 during her hospitalization.
3. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine was stable at approximately
1.1 during her diuresis through 10/30/2006.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was maintained on Nexium
during her hospitalization. Her hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 32.4.
5. Endocrinology: The patient was maintained on Levoxyl and her
home NPH regimen.
6. Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin for
cellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving as
the erythematous area was decreasing from 5/4/206 to
10/30/2006. She was also started on gentamicin on 10/11/2006 for
asymptomatic bacteriuria. The patient&apos;s urine culture on
8/19/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas.
CODE STATUS: During this hospitalization , the patient reiterated
that she is a full code. It was discussed with her that she is
difficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. She was
one time intubated nasally. In any event , she wants all life
saving measures performed. At the time of this dictation , she is
a full code ( healthcare proxy Harry Behran , phone number ( 860 ) 377-5068 ).

ATTENDING: SANTIAGO DESORCY MD
SPEAKER NAME: Roscoe Campean , M.D.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation , and atrial
fibrillation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain x 3 months and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 75-year-old female with no previous cardiac disease who
presented this morning with chest pain and shortness of breath ,
which had been limiting her over the last month. She had
gastrointestinal surgery earlier this year , complicated by need
for wound infection with revision and debridement.
Before her surgery , she could walk 20 minutes every morning , and
was very active. Over the last month , she has been limited by
shortness of breath , substernal chest pressure , and an overall
decrease in exercise tolerance. She cannot walk across the room
without difficulty now. The pressure in her chest is
nonradiating , is like a pressure rather than sharp , comes
unpredictably with exertion , and is relieved by rest. The
shortness of breath accompanies the pain. The symptoms have been
becoming more severe , and last night , she had rest shortness of
breath and chest pain. This morning she came to the emergency
department because her visiting nurse for her wound care told her
she looked worse and more short of breath and that she should
come to the hospital. She has never had chest pain or shortness
of breath until a little over a month ago , but does take
beta-blockers for a few isolated episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia that she had during her surgery
admission. She sleeps on two pillows every night , which is
chronic but does not get short of breath when flat. She denies
PND , palpitations , weight gain , swelling , or syncopal episodes.
She is a nonsmoker , nondiabetic without high cholesterol that she
knows of. Her chest pain is 2/10 upon admission to the emergency
department and is now 0/10 with nitroglycerin. In the emergency
room , she was given heparin , Plavix , aspirin , beta-blocker ,
Plavix 300 , and oxygen.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM:
She does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Her pain is
unrelated to eating. She has no cough , sputum production , and no
history of blood clots. She does not have calf pain , and she has
no neurologic symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Status post bowel resection for diverticulitis , status post
ileostomy take down in 7/21 , status post closure of wound
8/19/04 , and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during last
hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Brother with angina at age less than 55.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No tobacco. No ETOH.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Beta-blocker ( the patient does not know dose ).
ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs: Afebrile , heart rate 83 , blood pressure 113/72 ,
respirations of 18 , and saturation 98% on room air. In general ,
the patient was sitting up comfortable , in no acute distress ,
breathing comfortably. Coronary exam: Regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. Slight murmur diastolic in the axilla. Heart
sounds were distant. Jugular venous pressure at 8 cm.
Pulmonary: Faint crackles inferiorly bilaterally superior 2/3rd
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam: Positive
bowel sounds. Wound was covered , some small amount of drainage
on the dressing , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: 2+
pulses bilaterally , 1+ pretibial edema bilaterally. Neck exam
was significant for loud carotid bruits bilaterally.
ADMIT LABS:

0.8 , and blood glucose of 151. Troponins upon admission: CK-MB
1.4 , CK 63 , and troponin less than 0.10 , d-dimer 1408 , which is
high , PT , PTT , and INR: PT was 17.1 and INR 29.1. ECG normal
sinus rhythm. No ST changes. No Q waves. Chest x-ray: No
evidence of infiltrate. No evidence of congestive heart failure
such as hilar prominence or effusion. Cardiac axilla was
slightly enlarged which is unchanged from her 10/29 films.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was thought to have acute coronary
syndrome and was sent to have a left heart catheterization. At
catheterization , she was found to have a large dyskinetic heart and
severe mitral regurgitation but no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease.
Cardiovascular/pump: Echocardiogram on hospital day 2 showed mild to
moderate left ventricular enlargement with moderate mitral
regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. There was only mild
structural mitral valve disease with MAC and leaflet thickening. Left
ventricular systolic function was moderately to severely impaired.
Management for congestive heart failure was pursued with the intention to
reassess LV size , function and MR after optimizing medical therapy. We
began diuresis at this time with 40 mg of IV Lasix. The patient came in
at 64 kilograms and discharge weight and dry weight is 58.0 kilograms.
The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as well as
q.d. p.o. Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient developed atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular
response. Heart rate was often into the 150s-160s. We were able
to eventually obtain control with Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
diltiazem p.o. 30 mg t.i.d. , which was then converted to 45 mg
b.i.d. for an outpatient dosing. The patient was also started on
Coumadin while in hospital. She will follow up in Coumadin
Clinic. The day after discharge , she will have labs drawn to
check her INR. She will be on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
until INR becomes therapeutic.
2. Wound care: The patient has open abdominal wound
approximately 2 cm x 2 cm that is followed by Dr. Schoolman , Neville Surgery came by to see Mrs. Lenix in hospital and made
recommendations for wound care. CT scan showed no evidence of entero-
cutaneous fistula. The patient will get follow up wound care at home with
visiting nurses.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
1. Tobacco , 80-pack-year history , quit in 1990.
2. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for temperature of
99.2 , heart rate of 121 in sinus tachycardia , blood pressure
116/60 , saturating 98% on room air. She was noted to have a 2/6
systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs were clear bilaterally.
Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasic
dopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showed
bilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration at
the base of the left fourth toe. All toes are exquisitely tender
to palpation. Sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath was
admitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vascular
disease which was suspected to be contributing to her new
ulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as an
exacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , status
post coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. She was
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an MRA
to evaluate her anatomy. Unfortunately , the patient was unable
to tolerate the MR and did experience some mental status changes
that prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she received
some narcotic following her hemodialysis round. Over the ensuing
days she required rather significant doses of Zyprexa and Haldol
to contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also get
physical and violent. This appeared to sedate her sufficiently
and over the following days , she did manage to calm significantly
and returned to her baseline mental status. She did appear very
emotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incredibly
remorseful for previous events. On 6/28/2006 , she was offered
an angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremity
runoff anatomy. She did tolerate this well under simple IV
conscious sedation. This showed chronic disease with
collateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet with
essentially one vessel run off on either side. After extensive
discussions with the patient and the patient&apos;s family , the
patient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass
graft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.
Please see the operative note for further details. The patient
did tolerate the procedure well. By time of discharge , she was
tolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with her
rolling walker. The pain was well controlled with minimal
analgesics that were not narcotic based. Cardiology was
consulted during this time to optimize her prior to the OR. Her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Fugle did make some recommendations
including an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejection
fraction and no wall motion abnormalities. Her beta blockade was
titrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.
She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without undue
difficulty. She did on one occasion experience dyspnea following
hemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac events
or in evidence by EKG or by following cardiac enzymes. As the
patient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level of
activity with very strong support at home , she was discharged to
home with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation.
She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Sedlachek in one to two
weeks.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Touchdown weightbearing on the left heel. The patient should
not keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at a
time. She was to use the walker and a cane as instructed by
physical therapy.
2. Legs are to be elevated as much as possible while sitting or
lying down.
3. All home medications were to be resumed except for Lopressor ,
the dose of which had been changed by Dr. Huggins to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. VNA was ordered to assist with wound care including Betadine
paint to incisions daily.
5. Showering only , no bathing or immersion in water for
prolonged periods of time.
6. Follow-up visit to be scheduled with Dr. Amorose in one to two
weeks and Dr. Morici primary care physician in one week.

Discharge Date: 1/3/1992
DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
ALBINISM.
HISTORY OF GOUT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old Korean
male with a history of coronary artery
disease , who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting and
presented with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the back
and arm occurring 7 hours previously. The patient&apos;s history of c
coronary artery disease began in 20 of June , when he developed substernal
chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization showing a 100%
right coronary artery occlusion and 80% left anterior descending
occlusion , 70% proximal mid-left anterior descending lesion.
Angioplasty was attempted , but was unsuccessful. In 1 of January , the
patient underwent a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.
Melsheimer at Largdon Tar County Health with a left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending and right internal
mammary artery graft to the posterior descending artery. However ,
the patient had persistent incisional-type pain after his coronary
artery bypass grafting , but reported absence of his angina pain
post-CABG. The patient underwent an echocardiogram post-CABG
showing normal left ventricular function with no regional wall
motion abnormalities , moderate effusion and mild left atrial
enlargement 4.8 centimeters. The patient did well for 2 years
post-CABG and underwent an exercise tolerance test in 15 of September ,
exercising for 10 minutes and 0 seconds , maximum blood pressure
170/100 , without chest pain or electrocardiogram changes ,
considered to be a negative test. Since then , the patient has only
had sharp incisional pain not related to exertion , and he suffers
no exertional angina and has no exercise limitation. Over the past
several months , the patient has gradually developed increasing
exertional chest pain , increasing in both intensity and frequency ,
to the point where it was occurring daily 1 week prior to
admission. The patient had been tried on multiple medications as
an outpatient , however , because of issues of
noncompliance/alternative belief system , it was unclear as to what
medications the patient was actually taking. On the day of
admission at 1:30 pm , the patient experienced severe 8 out of 10
substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm with numbness and
neck tightness , associated with dizziness and numbness on the
scalp. The patient had no nausea , vomiting or shortness of breath ,
but did suffer pleuritic pain in addition. The pain lasted 30
minutes and was somewhat alleviated with rest and sitting in the
supine position on the way to the emergency room. At the Line Sumharca Center emergency room , the patient had worsening of
the severity of his pain and was treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin without relief , then morphine sulfate 4 milligrams
times 2 , Lopressor 5 milligrams times 1 , Nitro-Paste 1 inch with
complete relief. An electrocardiogram on admission showed normal
sinus rhythm , rate 80 , axis normal , no ST or T-wave abnormalities ,
no Q-waves. The patient was admitted to the Prorouge En No Team.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was notable for albinism , he denies ulcers or
gastrointestinal bleeds , he has a history of gout. HABITS included
former heavy alcohol use , however , he denies use in the last 6
months. The patient smoked cigarettes until 5 years ago.
ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY was
negative. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient is an appliance
technician , he is married with 3 children. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION revealed that the patient reported using Nifedipine-XL 30
milligrams by mouth each day , enteric-coated aspirin 1 per day ,
occasional Indocin and colchicine. His Inca Medical Center prescription also included Lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth
per day , and Isordil 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times , but the
patient denied taking these.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was mildly diaphoretic in no
apparent distress. Temperature was 97 ,
heart rate 78 , blood pressure 140/90 , respiratory rate 20 on 2
liters of oxygen with 97% saturation. Skin was pale with red hair.
Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , pupils
were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation. Carotids
were II+ bilaterally , there was a sternotomy scar on the chest , no
evidence of infection. Lungs were clear to auscultation and
percussion without rales. Cardiac examination showed a soft S2 , S1
was normal , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal examination showed normal
tone , normal prostate , guaiac negative. Femoral pulses were I+
bilaterally without bruits. Extremities showed II+ pulses in the
dorsalis pedis , no edema , the deep tendon reflexes were normal.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray showed clear lungs and no
pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
The electrocardiogram was as noted above. Sodium was 141 ,
potassium 4.7 , chloride 112 , bicarbonate 24 , blood urea nitrogen
26 , creatinine 1.8 , of note his baseline is 1.4 in 5-90 , glucose
85 , white blood cell count 3.59 , platelets 125 , 000 , hematocrit
44.5 , prothrombin time 12.7 , partial thromboplastin time 33.9 ,
creatinine kinase 1 , 010 with 20 myocardial bands , LDH 222.
Urinalysis was notable for 4+ proteinuria , no white cells , no red
cells , 1 to 2 hyaline casts.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The initial impression was the patient had
probable coronary disease and probable unstable
angina. He was admitted for intensive cardiac monitoring and
cardiac catheterization. The patient was started on heparin at
1 , 000 units per hour after bolus and sliding scale Nitro-Paste ,
aspirin and Lopressor , and continued on Nifedipine. On the first
day of admission , the patient suffered 2 episodes of substernal
chest pain and he was taken somewhat emergently to cardiac
catheterization which revealed a patent left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending , a patent right
internal mammary artery graft except for small vessel disease in
the graft , and an essentially occluded posterior descending artery.
The native coronary arteries showed occluded left anterior
descending proximally with filling from the left anterior
descending , circumflex showed a long 70% proximal lesion at the
second obtuse marginal branch with 90% distal lesion. The right
coronary artery was occluded proximally with right-to-right
collaterals and left-to-right collaterals from the left anterior
descending. The patient was planned for a 2-step angioplasty and
was returned to the floor for stabilization while awaiting his
angioplasty. However , the patient suffered 2 episodes of
substernal chest pain despite being on intravenous heparin and
intravenous nitroglycerin was initiated and the patient was
transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit. The patient
remained pain-free until he underwent angioplasty of the right
coronary artery lesions with a result of 20% residual stenosis. Of
note , the patient&apos;s creatinine kinase levels continued to trend
downward with the initial creatinine kinase being 1 , 010 being his
maximal value. The patient had no further chest pain after his
angioplasty , except for the baseline incisional pain which was
unrelated to exertion. The patient was monitored closely for 2
days after angioplasty. Nitroglycerin was tapered off and the
patient was discharged on 9 of January Of note , the 4+ proteinuria
was unresolved at the time of discharge , because of his unstable
course and transfers between the Intensive Care Unit and the floor ,
we were unable to complete a 24-hour urine collection. This issue
will be addressed further.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were aspirin 325 milligrams by mouth
each day , Lopressor 100 milligrams by mouth twice a day. CONDITION
ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient will FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Jewel Fennel in the Tor&apos;ssum Healthcare
Estimated disability is none.

Discharge Date: 10/8/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , presenting with progressive symptoms for cardiac
catheterization. Her cardiac history began in 20 of April , when she
presented with new substernal chest pain. She ruled in for a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction , was treated with medical therapy
and did well , until 5 of October , when she had progressive exertional chest
heaviness and shortness of breath. An exercise tolerance test was
positive at that time , and echocardiogram showed good left
ventricular function. She had a cardiac catheterization which
showed a 90% left anterior descending , 75% first diagonal , 75%
second diagonal. The cardiac catheterization was complicated by
foot cellulitis , sepsis and deep vein thrombosis and she was in and
out of the hospital for several months recovering. Given this , she
was hesitant to undergo further procedures and was treated with
medical therapy. The patient did fairly well with stable angina
and shortness of breath , until 1 year prior to admission when she
had slowly progressive increase in her chest heaviness and
shortness of breath , limiting her activities. Her anginal pattern
has not changed recently in a significant manner , but over the last
several months her pain has been extremely limiting to her
activities , and thus she presented for cardiac catheterization and
a question of revascularization. The patient has stable 2-pillow
orthopnea , she has claudication with a 10-minute walk relieved with
rest. The patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Her chest
pain is not associated with diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting ,
radiation , or syncope. It is associated with upper chest
heaviness , shortness of breath and warmth in the chest and neck.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for coronary artery disease as
above , diabetes times 20 years on insulin for the last 10 years ,
complicated by neuropathy and retinopathy , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , breast cancer status post left mastectomy and
radiation therapy in 1979 , peripheral vascular disease ,
musculoskeletal pain syndrome , she had a positive ANA previously on
work-up , but her symptoms are fluctuant and easily controlled.
History also included deep vein thrombosis during her previous
cardiac catheterization , cataracts , status post cholecystectomy and
appendectomy. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Nifedipine-XL 60
milligrams each day , Inderal 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,
insulin 45 units of NPH each morning , sublingual trinitroglycerin
as needed. FAMILY HISTORY was negative for coronary artery disease
and diabetes. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIAL
HISTORY revealed the patient lives with her daughter in Cu I , she does not smoke nor drink.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was in no apparent
distress. Vital signs were within normal
limits. Head and neck examination was unremarkable. Lungs were
clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination revealed regular rate
and rhythm with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur , no S3 , no S4 , no
jugular venous distension. Abdominal examination was nontender ,
nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , normoactive bowel sounds , no
masses. Extremities showed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema.
Neurologic examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , platelets were 318 , 000 ,
hematocrit 41.7 , white count within normal
limits , prothrombin time 11.2 , partial thromboplastin time 31.1 ,
electrolytes were unremarkable. Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates
or effusions. The electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm at 70
with axis 0 , intervals within normal limits , left atrial
enlargement , T-wave inversion in III , but no acute ST-T wave
changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed a 90% proximal left
anterior descending stenosis , 70% mid-left anterior descending , 90%
first diagonal , 70% second diagonal and 100% obtuse marginal branch
stenosis. The right coronary artery was not cannulated , but looked
normal with what dye could be injected. A percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty was planned the following day for
dilatation of her serial left anterior descending lesions , however ,
the patient had significant bleeding the night before , when arising
after her cardiac catheterization and the decision was made to wait
until over the weekend to do the percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty. On Monday , the patient underwent percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty with successful dilatation of the
serial left anterior descending lesions , both down to 30% , and did
well. Sheaths were removed the next day and the patient was
discharged.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. CONDITION ON
DISCHARGE was stable. The patient is to FOLLOW-UP
with her Egele Hospital cardiologist. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were the same as her admission medications.

Discharge Date: 10/7/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2 ) STATUS POST MULTIPLE INJURIES.
3 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42 year-old gentleman
with dilated cardiomyopathy with
worsening functional status. He was admitted for transplant
work-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of his
medical treatment. He initially developed symptoms approximately
six years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea and
orthopnea. His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly
and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated
cardiomyopathy. In 1992 , a catheterization was performed with
clean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a
&quot;cerebrovascular accident&quot;. He was on Coumadin at that time. His
symptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegia
which lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT was
negative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. In
February of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated a
left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejection
fraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitral
regurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities.
He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without
any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this
year. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viral
illness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram in
October of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombus
and ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and his
Atenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , he
was able to participate in activities such as sledding and skating
with only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. In
October of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which he
went 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressure
product was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. At
the time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol was
increased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headache
and insomnia. Now , over the prior one to two months , proceeding
admission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea on
minimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreased
appetite. His weight is stable , but it is felt to be a decrease in
the body amount with an increase in fluid weight. He has nocturnal
shortness of breath and dyspnea. There is no syncope. He was seen
by Dr. Parker Willy and was felt to be at that time a class four
on the Thyna 1 , Cuse , Nebraska 41604 . His Lasix was increased and he
was referred for admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for orthopnea as well as paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea four out of seven nights.
There is no nocturia. His exercise tolerance is approximately one
flight of stairs with moderate shortness of breath. He complains
of nausea and anorexia without vomiting. He also has insomnia and
erectile difficulties. He has a 6 lb. weight loss over the week
prior to admission following an increase in outpatient diuretic
use. His baseline weight was 175 lbs. One month ago , it was 165
lbs. and the day of admission , it is 155 lbs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cardiomyopathy as above , gunshot
wound to his chest and head at the age of 14
and motor vehicle accident , Hepatitis B. He has had four
colonoscopies in the past and has had no polyps.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for appendectomy and a ganglion
cyst in his right wrist.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5 )
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Kay Ciel 10 mg p.o. q. day. 7 )
Multivitamins one p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a sales representative for a food broker.
He lives with his wife and three daughters in
Y He was a former smoker who quit in 1984. Previously , he
had smoked one to two packs per day for twelve years. He continues
to use alcohol and drinks approximately six beers per week.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father is 70 years old. His mother is 68. He
has a sister with colon polyps and a brother who
is healthy. His family history is otherwise notable for familial
colon cancer and polyposis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Weight 72 kg , afebrile , heart
rate 78 , blood pressure 95/71 , respiratory
rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. HEENT is
normocephalic , atraumatic. Oropharynx revealed multiple fillings ,
but there is no abnormality. His neck is supple with no
thyromegaly , carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. His
jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. His chest is clear. His cardiac
examination is regular rate and rhythm with an S3 as well as right
ventricular impulse palpable and audible. His abdomen was soft ,
non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. He had no bruits. His
liver is 12-14 cm and 1 cm below the right costal margin. There
are no masses. His extremities were warm and well perfused.
Neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry ,
but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal.
LABORATORY: Laboratory evaluation on admission was notable for a
sodium of 133 , creatinine 1.2. Liver function tests
are notable for a bilirubin of 1.7 and 0.7. His complete blood
count is unremarkable. His INR was 1.4. His urinalysis was
unremarkable. Pulmonary function tests on admission included an
FVC of 81% of predicted and FEV1 of 78% of predicted and an
FEV1/FVC ratio of 97% of predicted. His DLCO is 90% of predicted.
EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 80 with first degree
atrioventricular block. His PR interval is 0.226. His QRS
interval is 0.10 and his QTC is 0.401. There was a left anterior
hemi-block. His axis is -49 degrees. There was left atrial
enlargement. There was poor R-wave progression. There were
flipped T-waves across the precordium. There was an increase in
left atrial size since October of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy now presented with
worsening functional status over the past few months as well as
recent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. There was a
question of patient non-compliance especially given his current
alcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness for
cardiac transplant at this time. Following admission , the patient
underwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated right
atrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , PA
pressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure at
the time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. Additionally , by Fick , his
cardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonary
venous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330.
Because of this markedly high SVR and a borderline PVR , he was
started on intravenous nitrates with intravenous Nitroprusside with
a significant decrease in his SVR as well as his PA pressures.
This was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressures
to suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate.
Therefore , he was transitioned to oral nitrates and started on
Isordil by mouth. However , he developed intolerance to nitrates
with severe headaches and ultimately all nitrates were
discontinued. He was subsequently managed only on afterload
reduction. His Analopril was held and he was started on Captopril
which was titrated up with good maintenance of his decrease in
pressure. Additionally , he was started on Losartan for further
afterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostatic
symptoms. His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued to
have quite a significant improvement symptomatically with no
further orthopnea in the hospital. Further parts of the cardiac
transplant work-up were undertaken including PPD and controls which
were placed. There was no reaction to either PPDs or controls at
72 hours. He had a B12 and folate level drawn which were within
normal limits. His thyroid function test demonstrated a TSH of 1.9
and all other parameters were within normal limits. Digoxin level
on discharge was maintained in a therapeutic range. Hepatitis
panel was sent and he was negative for Hepatitis B antigen or
antibody as well as Hepatitis C antibodies. 24 hour urine
collection was obtained for creatinine and his creatinine clearance
was at 88 at 24 hours. Pulmonary function tests were as noted
above. He was seen by Dental Consult and was felt to have a few
minor restorative needs which could be taken care of by his
outpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for a
transplant. Subsequent to his medical changes and his transplant
work-up , he was restarted on his Coumadin and was discharged when
his INR had become greater than 2 with a target range of 2 to 2.5
planned. Echocardiogram was performed on October , 1997 which
demonstrated 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+ mitral regurgitation ,
severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%.
There was diffuse severe hypokinesis and apical akinesis. There
was evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggesting
a clot. There was moderate left atrial enlargement.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition. He was markedly improved from
a symptomatic point of view on discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Royce Mcumber in
the Tho Medical Center
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Captopril 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. 2 )

4. Diabetes mellitus.
5. Serratia UTI.
6. Chronic renal dysfunction.
7. Dyslipidemia.

ALLERGIES:
Penicillins.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents with
shortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for
approximately three weeks. He has a history of coronary artery
disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently
placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,
hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. He
is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,
and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness
without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.
He presents after coming to an outside hospital with three to
four days of these worsening symptoms. He was transferred to
Baspit Hospital where he received most of his
cardiac care. The patient had these worsening heart failure
symptoms after a trip to I Hwy , Ny Vale , Michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion and
a five-pound weight gain. He has had no syncope , palpitations ,
but has had some mild nausea without emesis. At the outside
hospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline left
bundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. He was given
some Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed an
ejection fraction of 35%. He was transferred to Me Ale Firstray Hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a
heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall
distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. This is consistent with
an echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . Upon
presentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,
blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasal
canula. His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. His lungs had
rales bilaterally , approximately half way up. He had no
dullness. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left
axilla. He had no S3 , and no S4. His abdomen was mildly
distended. He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. His
extremities were warm. He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally. EKG at Baneers Hospital
revealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch pattern
and no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:
Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of
5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip.
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia. The patient has an extensive history of coronary
artery disease. He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose
beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin.
He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as
demand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary
hypertension. His enzymes trended down and were negative after
the initial check. Eventually , the patient received 48 hours of
intravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chest
pain free. At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclear
study , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with a
very small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that was
felt to be nonrevascularizable. He was maintained on optimum
medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization
in this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal
dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load
was not warranted nor indicated at this time. By discharge , he
was ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. Coronary
artery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF
exacerbation.
2. Pump. The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% upon
admission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. He was
initially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination of
Lasix and Natrecor. At this point , his pulmonary edema had
resolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. Given the
fact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further
diuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his
right and left heart filling pressures were. The patient was
taken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received a
right heart catheterization. His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery
pressure 56/18. His RA pressure was 8. There was some initial
false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath
lab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored
therapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary artery
catheter in place. At this point , his after-load reduction was
maximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with good
effect. His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to
2.7. His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2
liters of the patient. By discharge , the patient was actually
becoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a
calcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. Of
note , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the past
and is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. In the past , he had
had a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. On an
outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have
a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and
neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. The patient&apos;s
heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol ,
Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic
improvement.
3. Rhythm. The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. He was
maintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. His
electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.
He had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less
than 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. The patient is
not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular
pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his
QRS interval is greater than 150 ms.
4. Pulmonary. Given the fact that the patient had a normal
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery
pressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease
was undertaken. He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed
mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with
pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. He also
had pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests revealed
an FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. This gives an
FEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 ,
but an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mild
restriction. His lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted
suggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both corrected
and uncorrected are 50% predicted. His corrected DLCO is 13.5.
It is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung
disease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on
high resolution chest CT. A more likely explanation for these
findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate
diuresis with his congestive heart failure. The patient was
sating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.
5. Endocrine. The patient has very difficult to control
diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro
sliding scale while in house. He was briefly hypoglycemic during
his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.
This resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding his
long-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.
He was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m.
respectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge.
Furthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as well
as a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,
which is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such as
maintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg
and we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004.
6. Renal. The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency
presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. He
has had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a
creatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast
dye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal
insufficiency. We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three times
weekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.
His creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge and
his BUN was 67. He was making good urine and had no evidence of
residual urinary tract infection.
7. Infectious disease. Upon presentation , the patient after a
Foley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.
Urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratia
marcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosed
levofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.
8. Neuropsych. The patient has a history of depression and had
some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,
which resolved with p.r.n. Zyprexa as well as treating of the
underlying condition. Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt
like he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no
indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this
time. ( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed
to his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of
this age is not uncommon. )
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium for GI
prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code.
The patient was consulted by both Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would be
warranted at this time.

is little consistency between his story on admission and what
was recorded by his PCP in his S chart. Pt states he has had
increasing LE swelling for 2 weeks despite taking all of his
medications. Pt states that he has not increased his Na intake
recently. Pt repeatedly denied SOB , increased abd girth , and PND.
Pt did note that he sleeps on 2 pillows at night but his breathing
his fine when he is lying flat.
Next day spoke with patient&apos;s wife who confirmed story documented by PCP
including increasing shorntness of breath and orthopnea.
ED: lasix 120 IV x 1 ROS: no fevers , chills , or night sweats. No
ST , hearing problems , or visual problems. No SOB , but
does note non-productive cough x 1 day. No CP , palpitations ,
orthopnea , or PND. No abd pain , N/V , diarrhea , BRBPR. Pt does

CONSULTS: Pulmonary Medicine ( Dr. Kohlmeyer )
-----
IMP: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss h/o CHF who presents with
2 weeks of LE edema.
-----
PLAN:
CARDS:
I: No known h/o CAD-little concern for ACS with no sxs except LE
edema -unclear why not on ASA , no h/o GI bleed or ulcer. Will start ASA
for primary/secondary prevention. Checked lipid profile , trigs very
elevated at 482 and HDL 24. LDL could not be peformed b/c trigs were so
high. Started gemfibrozil , pt can have repeat lipid profile as outpt and
statin at discretion of PCP. Pt was continued on BB but dose was
decreased to 50mg po daily as pt having asymptomatic bradycardia to 40&apos;s
while sleeping.
P: Pt&apos;s OS notes list CHF as dx , pt denies any h/o LE edema or CHF
before 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. Last echo in 4/3
showed LVH w/ preserved EF. Pt with likely diastolic dysfunction. Pt on
exam has only LE edema , but received 120 IV lasix in ED. Pt&apos;s
presentation c/w CHF exacerbation but BNP of 13 is unusual. Continued
to diurese pt with IV lasix and once he was approaching euvolemia
switched him back over to home dose. Pt&apos;s LE edema likely multifactorial
due to CHF and some component of chronic venous stasis. LENIs were
checked and were negative for DVTS. Discontinued pt&apos;s CCB as may be
contributing to LE edema. Echo was repeated this admit which
showed EF 60-65% and signs of diastolic dysfunction.
HTN: BP was controlled this admit. Pt was continued on BB , norvasc , &amp;
catapres
R: no issues this admit
ENDO: Pt has h/o DM and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( unclear
dose ). Pt was started on Lantus with SS novolog and his sugars were
somewhat elevated. Advised pt to restart home insulin regimen after d/c.
Sent HgA1C but was still pending at the time of discharge.
RENAL: pt appears to have CKD per SHC recs -baseline 1.4-1.6 , renally
dose meds
NEURO: Pt&apos;s wife noted that pt has intermittently been confused at home.
She describes episodes when he wakes up at night and doesn&apos;t know where
he is. This is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea and
rarely wears cpap at home. Pt was alert and oriented during this admit.
Sent labs to evaluate for secondary cause of dementia and they were
negative. Suggested that pt f/u with PCP if these episodes persist.
PULM: Pt with h/o sleep apnea. Per 2003 sleep study pt&apos;s sleep apnea
was central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believe
based on pt&apos;s body habitus and redundant neck tissue. Pt evaluated by
pulmonary after RA ABG showed PaO2 50&apos;s. Pt pulse ox was monitored and
when he fell asleep without his cpap he desatted to low 60&apos;s and high
50&apos;s. Pt satted in mid 90&apos;s on RA while awake and upright. Pulmonary
thought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea
( central +/- obstructive ). Pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the night
prior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. Of note pt used the
nasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. Tried to set up pt
for home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study.
Communicated this with pt&apos;s PCP who will set up repeat sleep study in
near future. Pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonary
recs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt&apos;s with
central sleep apnea and heart failure.

PROCEDURES: SEE HOSPITAL COURSE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old gentleman
with a past medical history
significant for diabetes mellitus , obesity , coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting and pacemaker placement
in 1996 and 1999 respectively , who presented on 7/16/2000 with a
four day history of cough , fevers , chills , myalgias and left eye
pain. The patient also noted over the course of four days prior to
admission , that his p.o. intake had been decreasing. He had been
experiencing nausea and vomiting without diarrhea and fevers to 103
degrees. On the day of admission the patient noted the sudden
onset of vision loss in his left eye associated with redness and
pain. In the Emergency Room the patient was given Diamox , aspirin
and nitropaste in response to T-wave inversions anteriorly on his
electrocardiogram. In addition , the patient was cultured and
started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Ceftriaxone ,
azithromycin and Gentamycin.
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.2 , heart rate 60 ,
blood pressure 118/78 , 98% oxygen saturation on 100
percent face mask. HEENT: OS with hazy , edematous cornea ,
moderately dilated fixed pupil with erythema and injected
conjunctiva. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy , no carotid
bruits and no jugular venous distention. LUNGS: Bibasilar scant
crackles. CHEST: Distant heart sounds. Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs , rubs or gallops. S3 , loud S2. EXTREMITIES: Minimal
edema , no cyanosis. 2 plus peripheral pulses. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
soft , nontender and nondistended. Normal bowel sounds. Difficult
to assess. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal. RECTAL: Guaiac negative
brown stool.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Chemistry panel showed BUN 74 ,
creatinine 2.8 ( baseline 1.0 ) ,
otherwise normal. Albumen 2.4 , liver function studies otherwise
normal. CK 169 , troponin 1.7 , CBC showed a white blood cell count
of 5.5 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 51. Electrocardiogram showed
paced rate of 60 with T-wave inversions of V1-V6. Chest x-ray
showed cardiomegaly with vascular redistribution. No focal
infiltrates noted. CT of the head showed no evidence of acute
bleed. Urinalysis essentially negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease: The patient was
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
in the Emergency Room and was rapidly noted to be hypotensive with
a systolic blood pressure in the 72. The patient was hydrated
aggressively and consistently pan cultured. The patient began to
spike fevers from 100 to 101 range. On the second hospital day ,
the patient grew 4/4 bottles of what turned out to be Group B streptococcus.
The patient&apos;s antibiotics were changed to Penicillin and Gentamycin. A
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on the day of
admission and did not demonstrate any vegetation , however with
persistent high spiking fevers , sepsis and 4/4 blood culture
bottles , repeated blood cultures growing GBS the patient had repeat
transesophageal echocardiogram. This demonstrated a 1.5x1.0
centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspid
valve and it was also noted to be hitting the pacemaker wire though
not fixed to it. Of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogram
was negative for patent foramen ovale.
The patient presented complaining of left eye pain and loss of
vision on the night of admission in the Emergency Room , the
ophthalmologist saw the patient and determined that the patient had
an elevated pressure. The elevated pressure was treated and he
responded well by the following day. At that time the patient&apos;s
eye was aspirated and noted to also be infected by GBS. The
patient was injected intraocular with Vancomycin at that time.
Unfortunately the patient continued to spike fever despite
appropriate therapy for his GBS and his eye appeared to be
worsening with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and a
purulent exudate. It was determined that the patient would require
enucleation which he underwent on 5/10/2000.
The patient also had a right lower extremity cellulitis during his
hospital course. This was treated with a ten day course of
dicloxacillin and resolved without complications. The patient&apos;s
course was complicated by persistent fevers despite appropriate
antibiotic therapy and left eye enucleation. An extensive work up
was undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation for
possible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints. None
of these proved to be a source. The patient underwent multiple
joint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clear
evidence of infection. The patient also underwent a tagged white
blood cell scan which demonstrated increased uptake in the left
shoulder , manubrium , right knee , left ankle and mid shaft of the
left tibia. These were interpreted both on the initial views and
delayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but not
diagnostic of infection. As mentioned above the patient was also
treated for cellulitis and underwent left eye enucleation. The
patient&apos;s fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay and
on the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeat
transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was no
myocardial abscess. There was no evidence of any abscess and the
vegetation was no longer visible. It was felt that the low grade
fevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute
infectious process at the time of discharge. The patient&apos;s last
positive blood culture was 4/3/2000.
Of note , there was concern that the patient&apos;s fever could be
secondary to a drug reaction. Therefore once the infectious work
up was completed , the Penicillin was changed to Vancomycin. His
gram positive coverage will need to be continued for four weeks
after his left eye enucleation.
2. Ophthalmology: As described above , the patient presented with
left eye pain and vision loss. It was felt from the time of
presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left
eye. The patient was treated initially for his elevated pressure
and then the following day his eye was aspirated and injected with
Vancomycin. Ultimately the patient had left eye enucleation. The
patient&apos;s eye healed well through the remainder of his hospital
course and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter.
The patient&apos;s extraocular muscles were left intact with the thought
of placing a prosthesis at a later date.
3. Cardiovascular: On admission the patient was noted to have
T-wave inversions anteriorly on his electrocardiogram. However it
rapidly became clear that his pacemaker was malfunctioning
demonstrating only occasional pacing spikes. By 6/24/2000 the
pacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing. As mentioned above ,
the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation noted
on the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetation
was hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole. On
6/13/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without
complications.
The indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia.
There was some concern throughout the patient&apos;s hospital course
that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in
place however this never manifested as a problem. He did
demonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the early
phase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsis
resolved. He did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia
thought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia. His
Lopressor was increased in response to this and the patient was
tolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia or
hypotension.
The patient as mentioned above , underwent a transesophageal
echocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderately
dilated right ventricle with moderately depressed systolic
function. Mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent with
elevated right heart filling pressures. The patient&apos;s cardiac
function appeared to be stable throughout his hospitalization. he
did rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission.
4. Musculoskeletal: One of the patient&apos;s major presenting
complaints was significant arthralgia and myalgia. It was though
that along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septic
polyarthritis. The patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the
rheumatology service. Though the fluid did demonstrate elevated
white blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutely
infected. There were no bacteria on gram stain or culture. The
patient&apos;s right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warm
during the initial part of the hospitalization. Therefore the
patient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/16/2000. The
patient&apos;s knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior to
closing all of the effusion was drained. There were no
complications. The patient continued to have symptoms of right knee
effusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on
10/28/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis. Since that time the right
knee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patient
has tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amount
of his range of motion. It was determined that the patient should
not have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warm
or erythematous.
The left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospital
stay. The patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of the
glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side and
under fluoroscopic examination. Again , this joint demonstrated
elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that
it was a septic joint.
The patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have an
elevated CK of 1522. It was thought that this was an insignificant
MB fraction. It was not felt that there was enough manipulation to
skeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this. This rise
in CK did coincide with increased muscle aches. It was felt that
the patient perhaps had a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis which
resolved quickly to a CK of 177 five days later.
At the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias or
arthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is still
somewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates an
effusion but is responding well to rehabilitation.
5. Pulmonary: The patient was quite stable from a pulmonary
standpoint throughout his hospitalization. The patient was
initially maintained in the Emergency Room on high flow oxygen
however was quickly weaned to nasal cannula and then room air. The
patient does have obstructive sleep apnea and used his BIPAP at
night throughout his hospitalization.
6. Hematology: On admission the patient demonstrated a
thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 51. This has improved throughout
his hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelets were
noted to be 538.
The patient was noted to have hematocrit that trended down and
corresponded to some guaiac positive stools with anticoagulation.
The patient received a total of four units of packed red blood
cells. His hematocrit has remained stable with a good reticulocyte
count at the time of discharge.
The patient was anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation
initially with Heparin and then ultimately with Coumadin 10 mg p.o.
q HS. The patient&apos;s INR has been therapeutic in the 2-3 range for
approximately five days.
7. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have an elevated
creatinine from his baseline of 1.0. This was thought to be
secondary to dehydration and prerenal azotemia. The patient&apos;s
creatinine reached a peak of 3.0 and stabilized at 1.3 at the time
of discharge. This appears to have resolved entirely with
resolution of sepsis and rehydration.
8. Fluids/electrolytes/nutrition: The patient was significant
dehydrated at the time of admission. This responded rapidly to in
vitro fertilization. He also regained his appetite as his sepsis
resolved. The patient is noted however to have a very poor
albumen , which is 2.3 at the time of discharge. The patient will
require improved nutrition at rehabilitation and after discharge
from rehabilitation. The patient&apos;s electrolytes were relatively
stable throughout his hospital stay.
9. Endocrine: The patient has a long standing history of type II
diabetes mellitus. On admission , he was taking metformin 1000 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , regular insulin 10 q a.m. and 10 q p.m. , NPH insulin
25 q a.m. and 20 q p.m. His hemoglobin A1-C was noted to be
elevated at 8.1 in 11/15 The patient&apos;s metformin was held
throughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possible
invasive procedures. He is maintained and NPH insulin as well as
sliding scale insulin. The patient was restarted on his metformin
prior to discharge and increased dose of NPH insulin. This will
likely need to be adjusted as the patient recovers further.
10. Gastrointestinal: The patient did develop guaiac positive
stools during his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. This
will need to be followed up as an outpatient once the patient has
made a full recovery from the acute event. Also the patient did
demonstrate a mild transaminitis during his hospital stay and this
appears to have resolved with the transition from Penicillin to
Vancomycin for his antibiotic regimen.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Colonic stricture status post sigmoid colectomy.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. History of diverticulitis.
2. History of questionable inflammatory bowel disease.
3. GERD.
4. Depression and chronic pain.
5. History of breast cancer.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Sigmoid colectomy in 2003.
2. Right breast lumpectomy in 1998.
3. Multiple Port-a-Cath placements.
4. Right axillary lymph node dissection in 1998.
5. History of endoscopy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 41-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis and
questionable inflammatory bowel disease with a known colonic
stricture since 4/5 The patient has had attempted to dilatation
without success. The patient has also recent history
of ribbon like stools and complains of difficulty with bladder
function as well as a sense of urgency to urinate. Her past
medical history is significant for diverticulitis , questionable
inflammatory bowel disease , GERD , depression , chronic pain , and
history of breast cancer. Her surgical history is significant
for sigmoid colectomy in 2003 , right breast lumpectomy , axillary
lymph node dissection in 1998 , as well as multiple Port-a-Cath
placements , and endoscopic treatment. She was admitted on
7/20/04 and taken to the OR for a sigmoid colectomy; the procedure
was complicated by a left ureteral injury for which Urology was
consulted intraoperatively. Urology placed a left ureteral stent
intraoperatively and made recommendations to maintain stent for a
total of six weeks after which time it would be removed on an
outpatient basis ( Dr. Mahaffy will be following this case ). In
addition , they recommended maintaining Foley for five days. The
EBL during the case was 2500 cc necessitating transfusion of 4
units of packed red blood cells. She was extubated and taken to
the PACU in stable condition with an epidural in place on
perioperative antibiotics of clindamycin and with NG tube in
place. On
postoperative day #1 , it was noted that the patient was
increasingly becoming confused and anxious as well as remained
tachycardic despite what was thought to be adequate volume
resuscitation and she was transferred to the unit at this point.
More specifically , in addition to being tachycardic later that
day on postoperative day #1 , she became tachypneic with noted
hypoxemia and mental status changes in need of intubation. Of
note , the patient was saturating at 96% on 100% oxygen via
facemask. It is also notable that the patient in the 24-hour
perioperative window received 14-liter of fluid resuscitation.
The night of postoperative day #1 , as mentioned earlier , the
patient was increasingly agitated before she was transferred to
the unit and although discontinued her NG tube it was thought at
this time that she may have aspirated. She also removed her
supplemental oxygen and was noted to have saturations in the 85%
range with tachycardia in the 140 range. A PE protocol CT was
obtained that was negative for emboli or DVT but was positive for
right upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that was
consistent with an aspiration event. She was subsequently
transferred on the night of postoperative day #1 to the ICU ,
intubated , and had a right IJ central line placed. Overnight ,
between postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 , her blood
pressure would drop requiring multiple fluid boluses in addition
to the administration of an additional unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 23. She also received albumin. Of
note , the CT also did not reveal any evidence of acute bleed;
however , this was a noncontrast study. She was placed on Versed
and propofol , intubated in the unit with a fentanyl patch ,
remained tachycardic , the origin of which was unclear. It was
thought initially that there was some type of narcotic control
that may be responsible for this tachycardia. However , it was
also speculated that she may be bleeding from an unknown source.
She was intubated , NPO , NG tube in place with IV fluid
resuscitation , Foley in place per Urology as noted above , on subq
heparin with close monitoring of the hematocrit with transfusions
to be given as necessary placed on a triple regimen of
clindamycin , levo , and Flagyl. On postoperative day #3 , the
patient in the unit with hypertension , anemia , tachycardia , the
patient&apos;s hematocrit was still 23 and she received 2 additional
units of red blood cells and hematocrit rose to 30 at this time.
She was poorly responsive on postoperative day #3 and it was
thought that she had better be weaned off of Versed which
happened to be replaced with haloperidol. In addition , clonidine
was added to her regimen as well as Lopressor secondary to her
tachycardia. There was close examination of her mental status
during this time. On postoperative day #4 , the patient was still
persistently tachycardic and hypertensive. JP was discontinued
on the day and , in addition , as noted above , Haldol and clonidine
were added to her regimen. She continued to be agitated and
there was a question raised then that there was an unclear
history that was not previously diagnosed of alcoholism and this
may have been an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon. So , her Versed
actually was increased then for a questionable alcohol withdrawal
and she was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate and in
addition for her hypertension Lopressor 5 q.4 was continued. She
was still intubated with goals of weaning off ventilation , NPO ,
NG tube to low suction , the question of TPN was raised , levo and
Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia which would be continued for
10-14 days. By postoperative day #5 , it was clear that this was
a problem of drug or alcohol withdrawal at least that was what
was thought. Her neuro regimen was changing at this time with
various measures using Versed , then using Ativan , and Apresodex
to changing her fentanyl regimen as well as adding morphine to
her regimen p.r.n. all with goals of increasing the general
relaxation. Psych was consulted on postoperative day #5 and
concluded that this woman had a history of polysubstance abuse ,
alcohol and likely opiates , and chronic abdominal pain due to
stricture which probably was related to her opioid abuse; I
believe the delirium was likely multifactorial in etiology ,
postoperative delirium that was notable for significant fluid
shifts , there was the question of aspiration pneumonia in
addition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal. They
recommended starting with Zyprexa if the patient was sedated in
the a.m. with a DC a.m. dose of Zyprexa and just use it in the
evening and agreed to taper off the Versed minimizing the use of
opiates as tolerated by the patient and encouraged the family to
reorient the patient to keep her awake during the day. On
postoperative day #6 , her mental status was gradually clearing.
Patient goal was to wean off sedation for a possible extubation.
Her blood pressure as well as heart rate were stabilizing and
tube feeds were also started at this point with multivitamins and
mineral replacement. In addition , urine output continued to be
good. Her hematocrit was stable. Her cultures were at this
point negative , but the antibiotic Flagyl-levo regimen was
continued. Of note , her stoma would gradually start to produce
fluid and her incision during this leg of her course remained
clean , dry , and intact. On postoperative day #6 , she was also
consulted by Addiction Psychiatry who concluded similar results
to recommendations concluded earlier. They would agree with the
Zyprexa and also recommended restarting Ativan , as I said ,
additionally agreeing with the taper off of the Versed with the
use of Ativan only for cases of agitation and additionally
recommended to the discontinue the Celexa and BuSpar the patient
was on until the delirium cleared to avoid a polypharmacy. Of
note , Psyche was able to speak with the husband who confirmed the
patient&apos;s longstanding history of alcohol dependence that likely
predated the 10 years that he had known her. It is important to
note that the patient was consuming approximately a quart of
Vodka a day as well as Peppermint Schnapps daily up until her
surgery last April . After that procedure , she continued to
drink presumably about 3 beers a day. However , the husband since
he was working so much was unable to really adequately guage just
how much alcohol she was drinking. In addition , she was noted to
have , this is per the husband , undergone multiple detoxes at
treatment facilities for alcohol dependence and believed that she
had experience withdrawal seizures in the past. On postoperative
day #7 , the patient&apos;s mental status was gradually improving with
weaning off of her Versed with IV Ativan and low doses as
tolerated and p.r.n. She , in addition , this day was tolerating
her tube feeds; however , she did pull her NG tube again. Her Foley
was taken out at this time. The ureteral injury believed to be
resolved at this point , continued on her levo and Flagyl with
question of whether or not to stop her antibiotic regimen. On
postoperative day #8 , mental status continued to improve and she
was started on sips which she tolerated well. Her IV was hep
locked and she was seen fit to be transferred to the floor. Of
note , also on postoperative day #8 , the patient had some low
blood pressure which was treated with volume resuscitation in the
form of normal saline boluses that stabilized right after her
transfer to the floor. On postoperative day #9 , it was noted
that the patient had some red stool in the ostomy bag. The
patient was hemodynamically stable this was afternoon of
postoperative day #9. Her labs were checked , CBC , and found to
be within normal limits and her ibuprofen which she was taking
was discontinued. On postoperative day #10 , with mental status
improving greatly , the patient had her central line discontinued.
Over the last couple of days , she had made attempts to walk and
was walking with PT. Her diet over the last couple of days had
been advanced without any problems and she was converted to a
house diet on postoperative day #10. On postoperative day #11 ,
her mental status seemingly completely resolved on regular diet ,
out of bed. It was noted though that she had some erythema of
the mid portion of her wound , three staples were removed from
this portion of the wound and serosanguinous exudate was
expressed , minimal amount of fluid. The wound was explored and
there was found to be no fascial defect. Cultures were taken at
this time and the wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressing with
instructions given to the patient and nursing for wet-to-dry
dressing changes t.i.d. On postoperative day #11 , the patient
was seen fit to be discharged home. Her mental status had
completely resolved. She was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable , tolerating a regular diet , and fully ambulatory. She was
to be discharged home with VNA Services. Medicine Team that had
been seeing her did agree that she needed to contact her
psychiatrist to provide an update of the current admission to
update her on her medical regimen inhouse and she is to schedule
an appointment to follow up with her psychiatrist. The Medicine
Team also recommended continuing her psyche medications she was
taking prior to admission that includes Celexa 4 mg q.d. , BuSpar
10 mg t.i.d. , nortriptyline will be started by her psychiatrist.
Also recommended to continue Ativan taper as followed with 1 mg
t.i.d. today , 1 mg b.i.d. the next day which would have been
5/29 , and then 1 mg q.a.m. on Wednesday 6/26, and then stop
taking the Ativan with instructions of no refills on the Ativan.
The Medicine Team also strongly enforced , reminded her not to
drink while taking the Ativan.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: PUPPO , EDUARDO M.D.
SERVICE: General Medicine Woodworth , OH
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: DKA and uremia.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Hypertension , diabetes , end-stage renal
failure , history of polysubstance abuse.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: The patient was intubated on 10/14/06
and also underwent an extubation 5/7/06. The patient had
removal of his right IJ tunneled catheter.
OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES: An MRI and multiple
hemodialysis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Pallares is a 53-year-old man with
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , also past medical
history of diabetes type 1 , hypertension , hepatitis C , alcohol
and polysubstance abuse who was found unconscious on 10/14/06
with a blood pressure of 140/80 , heart rate in the 80&apos;s and
satting in the mid 90&apos;s and a glucose of 320.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Upon finding Mr. Nadal it was notable of the
fact that he had missed hemodialysis the previous week. He was
intubated for airway protection. A head CT was normal on his
arrival to the hospital and his potassium of 6.9 was treated with
calcium , insulin bicarbonate and glucose. He received
Vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl. He was admitted to the
Medical ICU. In the Medical ICU the metabolic acidosis was
thought to be secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis combined with
uremia. A tox screen was negative. An EEG showed diffuse
slowing. The patient was reinitiated on hemodialysis. Sputum
from his lungs grew out serratia that was pan sensitive and the
patient was put on Vancomycin and Ceftaz after spiking fevers.
His right internal jugular tunneled catheter was removed even
though his fistula was partly infiltrated. The patient was
extubated on 8/7/06 , his mental status improved , and the
patient was sent to the floor.

Discharge Date:
ADDENDUM: Please see prior dictation. This is an addendum to the
previous discharge summary dictated on 4/28/91 .
On postoperative day number five , as the patient was being prepared
for discharge to the Statespack Rhodera Of Hospital , she spiked to 101.7 and then to
102.2. A complete fever workup was done which included negative
blood cultures , a urine culture positive for 10 , 000 Enterococci
consistent with a mild urinary tract infection. Of note , the
patient had no evidence of pyelonephritis without any CVA
tenderness. She had a chest x-ray performed which showed only
atelectasis. Careful examination of the lower extremity showed no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis. The most likely source of
fever in this morbidly obese woman was a wound infection. Thus ,
the patient&apos;s staples were removed , and the wound was carefully
examined. The following day , after heat had been applied to the
wound , one small area in the wound separated , and a seroma
containing some serosanguineous fluid was drained. The wound was
then deeply probed , and extended very deeply. The fascia was
completely intact. A Penrose drain was placed through the opening
in the incision to allow the serosa to completely drain. The
following day , on postoperative day number eight , the drain was
removed , and the wound was packed deeply with Nu-Gauze soaked in
half strength hydrogen peroxide. Wet-to-dry dressing changes were
performed for several days , and the wound continued to remain clean
with healthy appearing tissue. Wound culture revealed Staphylococcus
coagulase negative. She had been started on oral Ampicillin for enterococcal
UTI.The
patient became afebrile immediately after the wound drained and had no further
elevations in her temperature. A chest film showed only
atelectasis , and thus she was vigorously ambulated and received
more chest physical therapy , and Albuterol nebulized treatment. Of
note , the patient&apos;s white count rose to 16 with a fever again
probably associated with the patient&apos;s wound infection. The
patient is thus discharged home on 8/1/91 , postoperative day 12 in
stable condition. She will be followed very closely by the
Visiting Nurses Association with frequent dressing changes and
wound care. She will also be followed very closely by Dr. Jean Dorson as an outpatient. The patient is thus discharged home in
stable condition , following a complication of her surgery , a wound
separation.

Discharge Date: 10/8/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was an essentially healthy
79 year old retired garment industry
worker , followed by Dr. Cecil W. Maslen , the internist at
Chicarl O Hospital for the question of transient ischemic
attacks. On the evening of admission , the patient and his wife
noted fatigue , light-headedness and 3 episodes of diaphoresis. The
patient took 1 to 2 ounces of ethanol for relaxation and several
hours later while attempting to climb stairs fell and was unable to
get up. Soon after , he had one episode of melenotic soft stool in
large volume without frank blood and then a moderate amount of
coffee ground emesis. The emergency medical technicians were
called , and in the ambulance the patient had a blood pressure of
110/68 , heart rate 110. At the Ipal Health
emergency ward , his blood pressure had dropped to 95/60 and he was
symptomatically orthostatic. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was
performed in the emergency ward , which showed an actively bleeding
1 cm antral lesion in the greater curvature , which was cauterized.
This was thought to be consistent with a pancreatic cyst or
leiomyoma , or less likely a metastatic lesion , along with some mild
esophagitis. He had no previous history of peptic ulcer disease.
The patient takes aspirin 1 to 2 tablets per day for several months
as question treatment for transient ischemic attack and for his hip
pain. He also has daily ingestion of ethenol , approximately 2 to 3
ounces , for many years. There was no history of nausea , vomiting ,
diarrhea , weight loss , abdominal pain , anorexia or any other
constitutional symptoms. There is a remote history of abdominal
pain and spastic colon with a negative work-up in 1976 , including a
Barium enema , upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal
ultrasound. He was admitted to the Suma Tondinoa Ylu County Hospital
Medical Intensive Care Unit , where his course was notable for a
5-unit packed red blood cell transfusion with stabilization of his
hematocrit and vital signs. The initial hematocrit was 21 and he
was transfused up to the 37 range. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION
included aspirin 2 po q day and Westcort Cream for psoriasis. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY was notable for chronic psoriasis , vertigo question
transient ischemic attack , status post multiple excisions for basal
cell skin carcinoma , history of hiatal hernia with a question of
reflux esophagitis , status post suprapubic prostatectomy for benign
prostatic hypertrophy , status post herniorrhaphy , status post
appendectomy , question of glucose intolerance diet controlled ,
status post right cataract surgery with lens implantation. FAMILY
HISTORY is notable for multiple siblings healthy in their late
80&apos;s , one brother with pancreatic carcinoma , hypertension in mother
and sister , no history of other systemic illnesses. SOCIAL HISTORY
reveals the patient is a retired woman&apos;s clothing manufacturer , who
lives in Field S with his wife , who is a Well Sirco Hospital employee. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS is negative , except for the
vertigo and occasional episodes of diaphoresis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a 79 year old man looking
remarkably well and fit. He was afebrile ,
pulse 60 , blood pressure 130/72. His skin was well tanned with
multiple psoriatic patches on the lower extremities. Head , eyes ,
ears , nose and throat examination was unremarkable. Neck was
normal. Chest was clear. Cardiac examination showed S4 , S1 and
S2 , no S3 , the murmur heard at admission was absent. Abdomen was
soft , flat , without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed pulses
to be intact without clubbing , cynosis or edema. Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: The electrocardiogram was normal. Chest
x-ray was normal. Urinalysis showed mild
pyuria and hematuria , which will be followed. Laboratory values of
note included a normal SMA-20 , except for a globulin of 1.6.
Hematocrit was 37 , with a normal differential.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent several diagnostic studies ,
including a repeat upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy , which showed the 1-cm gastric antral lesion. It also
showed some thickened folds within the stomach , which were
biopsied. The lesion was not biopsied for fear of rebleeding. The
patient also underwent an abdominal computerized tomography , which
showed a 1 to 2 cm cystic appearing lesion felt to be consistent
with either dilated pancreatic duct or a small pancreatic
pseudocyst. There was no evidence of intra-abdominal malignancy.
The patient also underwent an upper gastrointestinal series , which
was unremarkable. On 22 of July , the patient developed a tender left
big toe , which was initially thought to be gout or another
inflammatory arthritis , for example psoriatic arthritis , and he was
evaluated by the Rheumatology Service. The patient underwent a
joint tap , the findings of which were unremarkable. He also had
some erythematous changes on the forefoot , and the picture was
thought to be consistent with a mild cellulitis , with perhaps the
portal of entry being a psoriatic plaque. He was treated with
intravenous Kefzol and the erythema resolved overnight. The other
complicating issue is a mild elevation in liver enzymes noted on
the day before admission. This needs to be followed.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE include Pepcid 20 mg po bid
( this may be the cause of elevated liver function
tests ) , Velosef 500 mg po qid times 7 days , Westcort Cream.
Disposition is to home. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is good. FOLLOW-UP
care is to be provided by Dr. Marcelino F. Deaquino at the Tonver Thohang Baybrooksnu Hospital , and Dr. Antwan Pooyouma in the Division of
Gastroenterology at the Denon Of Medical Center .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
64 y/o F w/ DM , CAD s/p OM1 stent &apos;99 , w/ 1 month h/o worsened
exertional angina ( jaw tightness ) , and 2 day h/o worsening
intermittent jaw pain , SOB , presented after 2nd episode of pain at rest
to G ED. Initial enzymes were negative , patient was heparinized for
EKG changes and transferred to PMBMC ED where B-set TnI positive; TWI
in anterior leads. Cath results below.
Initial exam - BP 140s , HR 50s , afebrile , soft systolic murmur , clear
lungs. EKG- NSR , TWI in anterior leads , Troponin 0.67 , MB 7.4 , CK 303 ,
CK 303. HCT 39.1

**Hospital Course**
CV/HEME:
Patient underwent cardiac cath on 6/28/04 - LAD 90% lesion and OM2 99%
lesion both successfully stented with cypher. Remaining 100% PDA.
Following cath , patient had bradycardia to 20-30&apos;s in setting of
femoral hematoma. BP initially measured in 60s , thought to be vagal 2/2
femoral hematoma. Received atropine x 1 and Fem stop placed over cath
site for compression - BP dropped again with bradycardia- transferred
to CCU and briefly on dopamine. CT ruled out retroperitoneal
bleed. Hct stable. Transferred back to floor within 24 hours.
Patient also noted occasional mild abdominal discomfort , but had
negative LFTs and lipase. She also noted right calf pain and was found
to have a below-the knee right tibial vein DVT , was not anticoagulated
for this below-the knee clot because of low risk of embolization and he
r recent HCT drop/hematoma. LENI was repeated on day of discharge
and showed no progression. One the two days prior to admission ,
her HCT dropped from 32 to 26 , and she was trandfused 2 U PRBC
w/HCT bump to 34.1. Repeat CT showed shrinkage of hematoma , so
pt is being discharged with plans to have PCP recheck HCT at home
in 2 days.
MSK: Patient complained of left knee pain after fall one week prior.
X-ray shoed only osteoarthritis , although knee was somewhat warm.
There was no clear effusion , so patient is being given
ibuprofen PRN for now.
______
Anti-ischemic regimen at discharge: ASA , Plavix , Atenolol , Lisinopril.
( no Statin because of muscle pain hx ). Will continue home diabetic
regimen and followup with PCP/cardiology.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have chest
pain or difficulty breathing.
Dr. Estrello &apos;s office will send someone to your home on Sunday 8/17 to
draw your blood levels. Your hematocrit on discharge today is 34.1
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
You should have a repeat right leg ultrasound test ( &quot;LENI&quot; ) to follow
the small blood clot in your leg. You will need to schedule this test
to occur in the next 3-4 weeks through Dr. Gino Onisick office.

end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , hepatitis C positive , history of MRSA bacteremia ,
hypertension , CAD , status post MI , and sick sinus syndrome , status
post pacemaker in 1998 , who presents with fevers , chills , and a
question of an infected pacemaker pocket site. In October 2003 , he
had debridement of the pacemaker pocket and was doing fine , and
then over the week leading up to this admission , he developed
itching and tenderness of his right chest at the pacemaker site.
He was sent to the emergency room from hemodialysis today for
evaluation of his infected site. The pacemaker at that point was
scheduled to be removed on 9/17/03 , and when he was seen in the
emergency room , he denied any chest pain , shortness of breath ,
nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , cough , sputum production.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: End stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , hepatitis C , history
of MRSA bacteremia , hypertension , CAD , status post MI , sick sinus
syndrome , status post pacemaker in 1998 , history of closed head
injury with subsequent mental retardation , history of

Colace , Nephrocaps.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives at home with a roommate. His uncle is his
healthcare proxy. He has a past history of
smoking for two years , although quit a long time ago. He uses
alcohol occasionally. No IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 101.8 , heart rate
80 , blood pressure 130/80 , satting 97% on

No lymphadenopathy , no JVD , supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended , with positive
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm , DPs 2+. CHEST: Positive right
upper outer quadrant of chest over pacemaker site , with area of
erythema and fluctuance. NEURO: Alert and oriented x2 , non-focal
exam.
LABORATORY DATA: Include white blood cell count 7.3 , hematocrit
31 , platelets 256 , MCV of 113. Sodium 140 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 100 , bicarb 31 , BUN 23 , creatinine 6.1 ,
glucose 101 , calcium 8.3 , magnesium 1.9 , albumin 3.5 , total protein
9.2 , phos 2.0. Chest x-ray no infiltrate. EKG normal sinus
rhythm , no ST segment changes , left axis deviation and LVH , no
pacemaker spikes noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE/ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. ID - Candida non-albicans
grew out of his cultures from
his hemodialysis center. He was started on amphotericin-B with an
ID consult , and will complete a four week course on 2/18/03. His
cultures here at the Tholond Crawni Hospital remain negative. They removed his
infected pacemaker , as well as his Hickman catheter. He has been
afebrile here for the last several weeks , 2-3 weeks prior to
discharge.
2. Cardiovascular - ( A ) Rhythm - His pacemaker was removed. It
had been interrogated not long prior to his admission here and had
not been firing , and therefore , did not appear to be needed anyway.
He had to return to the EP lab a second time for a lead extraction ,
as they were unable to pull out the leads on the first attempt. By
his repeat echoes , however , he appears to have a retained pacemaker
wire although EP believes that they removed the entire wire for all
intents and purposes. It should be assumed that he does have a
retained wire , however. Also , the patient had episodes of atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response and a decreased blood
pressure after his pacemaker was removed. He was ultimately
treated with amiodarone with excellent control over his weight and
rhythm , and has been in normal sinus rhythm for the last week or so
prior to discharge. There are no plans for pacemaker placement at
this time. ( B ) Ischemia - He complained of chest pain while he was
here and ruled out for a MI. ( C ) Pump - Hypertensive while in
atrial flutter and then again during an episode of acute blood
loss. Since both issues have resolved , his blood pressures have
been very stable. He is to be continued on his Vasotec and
Lopressor. ( D ) Vascular - He had a traumatic left groin line
attempt. Vascular , subsequently , performed a groin exploration ,
hematoma evacuation , and sutured his vascular laceration. The
patient continued to lose a significant amount of blood into his
thigh , requiring several units of blood and one unit of platelets.
His hematocrit , however , has now been stable for one week prior to
discharge. He has a follow-up appointment with vascular on
11/20/03.
3. FEN/GU - Hemodialysis patent , very poor access. After removal
of his possibly infected hemodialysis catheter , IR was completely
unable to place an IJ or subclavian catheter on either side.
Ultimately , they had to place a tunnelled right groin line which is
very poor long-term option. He has a followup in vascular clinic with Dr Granfield
on 11/10/03 to address his access issue , for possible creatine of a groin
AVfistula or graft.
4. Heme - Hematocrit now stable , high 20s , low 30s. B12 and
folate are normal.
5. Disposition - The patient is to be discharged to rehab on
10/11/03 in stable condition. He has become very deconditioned
while he was here in the hospital as he was unable to get much PT
here given both his groin hematoma and some of his groin access
issues. Now there are no restrictions on his activity as his right
groin line is tunnelled.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , amphotericin
125 mg IV q.24h. to be given with 100 mg of hydrocortisone IV prior
to his amphotericin , also should be treated with 1 mg IV of

Discharge Date: 10/23/2003
Date of Discharge: 10/23/2003
ATTENDING: BLAKE CULBERSON MD
The patient was on the Re Hospital
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Small bowel obstruction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 80-year-old woman with a
past medical history of incarcerated umbilical hernia. She also
has a history of coronary artery disease. She presented with one
day of substernal chest pain , shortness of breath , and nausea.
The patient has normal angina pain , which is usually treated with
nitroglycerin , but she had run out. The chest pain had resolved
with nitroglycerin given in the ambulance. The patient also
complained of having abdominal pain for the past few days with
some nausea. Her last bowel movement was two days before
admission with no flatus for the past two days as well. The
abdominal pain was worst today. The patient was felt to have a
partial small bowel obstruction in the emergency room and was
evaluated by both the surgical service and the medical service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Incarcerated umbilical hernia and a mitral
valve replacement with a St. Jude valve in 1990. She had
coronary artery disease with a clean catheterization in 2001 ,
hypertension , diabetes , diverticulitis , status post a sigmoid
colectomy , and atrial fibrillation controlled with Coumadin 3.5
mg q.d.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg q.d. , Glyburide 5 mg q.d. , Lisinopril
20 mg q.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.d. , Coumadin 3.5 mg q.d. , Isordil 20
mg three times a day , amiodarone 200 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: She has allergies to aspirin , penicillin , and
sotalol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone with no smoking and no alcohol
use.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.8 ,
heart rate was 76 , respiratory rate was 18 , blood pressure
152/79 , O2 saturation was 94% on two liters. In general , she was
in no acute distress and pleasant. Cardiovascular exam: She had
an irregular rhythm with audible S1 and S2. No S3 was heard. No
murmurs. No jugular venous distension. Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen had increased bowel
sounds , was tympanitic , was diffusely tender. Her extremities
had no edema.
LABS: She had a white blood cell count of 14 , hematocrit of 42 ,
platelets of 221 , 000 , sodium of 144 , potassium of 4 , chloride of
109 , bicarb of 28 , BUN of 20 , creatinine of 1.6 , blood glucose of
200 , troponin I was less than assay , CK was 118 , INR of 2.6. KUB
x-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel consistent with small
bowel obstruction. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 78 beats
per minute with an incomplete right bundle branch block , an old
inferior MI with loss of anterior fossa.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient&apos;s abdominal pain was most likely
due to small bowel obstruction secondary to a ventral hernia. It
was decided by the surgical service that the ventral hernia
should be fixed operatively. The medical service evaluated the
patient , decided that her chest pain was her normal baseline
angina and she had no acute coronary syndrome at the time of
admission. Recommendations were made to discontinue her
Coumadin , allow her INR to fall to 1.8 before operating. The
patient was also to be given generous boluses of normal saline
preoperatively to avoid hypotension and tight blood sugar control
during her hospital course. The patient was admitted to the
medical floor before her operation and was scheduled for ventral
hernia repair several days later. During her stay on the
surgical ward , the patient had developed complaints of new visual
changes described as objects of floating in her visual field. At
this point , a CT scan of the head was done to rule out an acute
cerebral avascular accident. Head CT was initially read as
normal. No acute bleed. However re-read as showing a left-sided
sub acute thalamic infarct of 10 days to 2 weeks age. At this
point , a neurological consultation was obtained. The neurology
consultant recommended an MRI/MRA of the head and neck to
evaluate for possible hidden acute stroke and a carotid
ultrasound to assess her carotid artery patency. The MRI/MRA of
her head was negative , a carotid ultrasound was done which was
also negative with no lesions similar to her previous carotid
artery ultrasound of 10/1 A transthoracic echocardiogram was
also done to evaluate for atrial clots. Her echocardiogram was
largely unchanged from her previous echocardiogram of 2002. She
had normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of
55% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Given this negative
workup for any acute stroke , it was decided to obtain an
ophthalmology consult to evaluate the patient&apos;s visual changes.
The ophthalmology consultant attributed her visual changes to
vitreous humor particulate matter , which is very common in older
people. It was most likely the cause of her visual changes. The
ophthalmology consultant recommended q.d. Pred Forte drops in
each eye for her status post corneal transplant.
The patient was finally taken to the operating room on hospital
day 7 for ventral hernia repair. The operation was uncomplicated
with minimal blood loss. Postoperatively , the patient&apos;s course
progressed well with good pain control , good progression of diet
and good ambulation. Postoperatively , the patient was restarted
on Coumadin and placed on IV heparin for prophylaxis secondary to
her mitral valve prosthetic. The patient remained in the
hospital for seven days after her operation for adequate
anticoagulation with Coumadin. On postop day 3 , the patient was
noticed to have bright red blood in her urine. A urological
consult was obtained for evaluation of gross hematuria. CAT scan
showed several centimeters of calcified bladder wall , which is
indicative of infection versus tumor. However no gross tumor
mass was observed and the remainder of her collecting system was
normal. The urological consult recommended follow up in Urology
Clinic in two to four weeks. The patient was then discharged on
postop day 7 to the Awind Pitwell Medical Center for continued physical therapy.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , vitamin B12
15 mcg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o.

FAMILY HISTORY:
He has a great aunt with seizure disorder and a history of
hypercoagulable disorders in his family.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He does not smoke or drink or use IV drugs. He lives with his
mother.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
He was afebrile 96.6 , heart rate 112 , blood pressure 161/82 ,
respiratory rate 18 , satting 95% on room air. He was awake ,
alert with a flat affect with slow responses and poor eye
contact. He was alert and oriented x2 at the time without
knowing the date. His pupils are equal , round , and reactive. Mucous
membranes are dry. JVP was normal. He had no thyromegaly. His
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. His heart was
tachycardic with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen was soft ,
obese with bowel sounds , some mild suprapubic discomfort.
Extremities , he had 2+ DP and PT pulses. He was alert; his neurologic
exam was otherwise nonfocal. He has slight dry
blood in his rectal exam with a boggy prostate , normal rectal
tone.
ADMISSION LABS:
Significant for white count of 8 , hematocrit of 43 , platelets of
322 , 000 , potassium 4.6 , creatinine 0.9 , TSH 3.8 , INR 6.7 , calcium
9.8 , magnesium 1.4. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of
1.025% with 1+ ketone , 2+ blood. Chest x-ray showed no acute
process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
In summary , this is a 48-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder ,
seizure disorder presenting with supratherapeutic INR and signs of
urinary retention.
Genitourinary: Given his prostate exam and history of BPH it was
thought that his urinary retention was due to a large prostate
complicated by taking opiates for his right leg pain and
potentially also contributing from his psychiatric medications.
He did well with a voiding trial after starting Flomax and he has
not had a Foley in since hospital day #2.
Right lower extremity pain: He had a negative noninvasive lower
extremity ultrasound with no cords palpated. He had prior a
orthopaedic workup that was negative. He is receiving oxycodone.
There has been some thought that maybe his hypomagnesemia is
exacerbating his pain possibly in the form of leg cramps. He is
being repleted with mag with increasing doses of standing
magnesium. However , exam is most consistent with underlying diabetic
neuropathy and he was started on Neurontin 300 qhs , which will need to be
titrated as outpatient.
Diabetes: He is a diabetic on oral agents. His oral medications
were held while in house and he was given NPH and sliding scale. Oral
medications were reinstituted for the last 5 days of his hospitalization.
Anticoagulation: He has history of antiphospholipid antibody
with history of stroke from mitral clot. He was supratherapeutic
on his Coumadin , upon arrival he was reversed with vitamin K and
is now subtherapeutic being bridged with Lovenox until his
Coumadin is at least 2. His Coumadin should be titrated
according to INRs that are checked every other day until for a
goal of INR 2-3.
Psychiatric: For his bipolar disorder and seizure disorder , he
was continued on his home meds.
Neurological: He had a brief episode of delirium over the
weekend which was likely thought to be metabolic and has now
resolved. He is at his baseline. He should avoid opiates when
possible.
Disposition: He was discharged to home on new medications which
include increased magnesium , flomax , neurontin. He should
continue his antibiotics for his sinusitis history , to be finished on 5/15/06.

Discharge Date: 11/28/2006
ATTENDING: SHELOR , KENDRICK M.D.
SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 79-year-old male status post stenting of the PDA and
PTCA , radioablation and stenting of his LAD in 2000. He had
recurrent ischemic symptoms four months later and cardiac
catheterization showed restenosis of his LAD with an 80% lesion
at D3. He had brachytherapy and repeat PTCA. Since then , he has
done well but he had increasing dyspnea from CR. Exercise
thallium test , which showed increasing LV filling pressures
during exercise and inferior apical ischemia. He was admitted
for cardiac catheterization , which was done on 2/13/06 and the
patient was found to have a 45% proximal right coronary artery
disease , 50% distal left main disease , and 95% mid LAD disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , dyslipidemia , and chest radiation ,
prostate cancer , osteoporosis , and urinary incontinence.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
He was admitted , made ready for surgery. He was taken to the
operating room on 1/5/06. At which time , he underwent a CABG
x3 with a LIMA to the LAD , a saphenous vein graft to the PDA and
a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal. The patient&apos;s
aortic valve was only found to be mildly stenotic with the valve
area of 1.4 and a peak gradient of 30. This was discussed with
his cardiologist , Dr. Cletus Columbres and a combined decision was made
not to replace the aortic valve at this time. The patient&apos;s
immediate postoperative course was uncomplicated. He was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in a stable fashion. He
was found to have an inferior lateral ischemia on EKG , therefore ,
he was taken to the cath lab , all grafts were found to be patent
and there was resolution of ischemia. He was weaned off his pressors and he
was extubated.
He was found to be hemodynamically
stable. He was started on Lopressor and gentle diuresis. On
postoperative day #3 , we titrated up his Lopressor and started on
his Norvasc and transferred him to the Step-Down Unit. On
postoperative day #4 , he was slightly tachycardic with ambulation
and we titrated up on his beta-blockers. PA and chest x-ray look
good. Physical therapy was consulted to decide whether the
patient would benefit from rehabilitation. He was started on
empiric levofloxacin for questionable pneumonia. He was found
suitable for discharge on postoperative day #5 , however , the
patient had isolated temperature and his white count was found to
be trending and he was hypertensive. The patient was found to
have a positive blood culture from when he had been in the
Intensive Care Unit and he was continued on levofloxacin. The
patient was discovered to have left leg cellulitis at the knee
where his saphenous vein graft was harvested from. He was
started on vancomycin. This area continued to be watched while
the patient remained on IV antibiotics. He was afebrile. His
white blood cell count was 12. The patient remained stable but
he continued to have a white count and left
leg ultrasound finally done on postoperative day #10 , revealed a
fluid collection above the knee to the mid calf mostly behind his
knee where the area of erythema was and his white blood cell
count went up to 15. Therefore , on 9/6/06 , the patient was
taken to the operating room , at which time , he underwent a
drainage and irrigation of his left lower extremity saphenous
vein donor site , moderate amount of fluid were expressed , and
cultures were taken. The patient was transferred back to the
Step-Down Unit after this procedure. Please see the continuing
dictation done by Valentin Krull for the rest of the patient&apos;s
hospital course and discharge status.

Discharge Date: 1/28/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
PROCEDURE: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT ON February , 1997.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49 year-old gentleman
with a ten year history of diabetes
mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , hypertension and increased
cholesterol who was admitted ten days following discharge from the
hospital following treatment for an infected left thigh wound. The
patient ran out morphine three days prior to his admission and
presents with a two day history of chest heaviness and shortness of
breath. The patient originally presented in September of 1997 with a
right foot cellulitis and claudication at 50 yards. This was
treated with debridement and broad spectrum antibiotics and
subsequently treated with amputation of his right toe. On October ,
1997 , the patient underwent a right femoral popliteal bypass. He
was subsequently readmitted in January of 1997 for a left femoral
popliteal bypass and a split thickness skin graft to his fifth toe.
He was admitted again in the end of January through the beginning of
April with a question of a left thigh wound graft infection for
which he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He was
discharged to home and is now readmitted with chest pain and
heaviness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the above with the addition
of hypertension , peripheral vascular
disease , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and depression.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Wellbutrin 75 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Glyburide
5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. 5 )
Nafcillin 2 mg intravenously q.4h. 6 ) Morphine.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.9 degrees ,
heart rate 92 , blood pressure 122/60.
Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. His neck
demonstrated a right carotid bruit. There was no lymphadenopathy.
There was no jugular venous distension. Auscultation of the chest
revealed bibasilar rales. Cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops or rubs. There was a
normal S1 and S2. Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel
sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended abdomen. Extremities
demonstrated bilateral groin scars and the left medial thigh wound
which was open for a length of approximately 5 cm with wound
packing. The base of the wound looked well granulated. There was
bilateral ankle edema. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory data revealed that the
electrolytes were normal. His white blood cell count
was 13.9. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CK was
70 and the Troponin I was 0.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service
where he ruled out for myocardial infarction
with CKs of 39 and 70. His EKGs however demonstrated marked T-wave
inversion in the precordial leads. The chest pressure and
tightness resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and Lopressor.
His initial presentation was complicated by the fact that it was
thought he was undergoing withdrawal from narcotics which he was
using perioperatively. However , he ultimately underwent a cardiac
catheterization on June , 1997 which demonstrated a 40% mid LAD
lesion and 50% distal LAD lesion , 50% proximal second diagonal
lesion and 99% OM1 lesion with slow flow , along with an 80% OM2
lesion and a 99% RCA lesion. Ejection fraction at that time was
noted to be 40%. Given the patient&apos;s presentation , he was booked
for coronary artery bypass grafting which he underwent on February ,
1997. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively and had an uneventful
postoperative recovery. He was maintained on Diltiazem for his
radial artery graft. His course was only complicated by
intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter. His
thigh wound appeared clean with wet to dry dressing changes and
there was no further evidence of active infection. The patient was
followed by the Stockcord Lo Clark Service ( the drug abuse service ) as well as the
Plastic Surgery Service throughout his hospital stay. Plastic
Surgery felt that his hand was well perfused at the time of
discharge. The patient remained in a normal sinus rhythm after
that brief episode of atrial fibrillation and he was not maintained

per renal team. resume outpt HD schedule MWF.
3 ) HEME: Pt with fistula bleed , likely compounded by plavix use. Hct at
30% ( low end of baseline ). Bleed stopped after prolonged pressure. HD
without difficulty in AM 4/6/05 , but because pt had a 6 unit drop ( from
30 to 24 ) , pt was kept for observation and was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs.
pt received an additional unit of PRBCs 2/22/05. pt was dicharged back to
rehab with no further bleeding on PM of 7/23/05.
4 ) GI: pt had episodes of guaiac+ stool on and off during this
hospitalization , but never frank melena or BRBPR. the GI consult was
informally consulted and felt that as long as pt was hemodynamically
stable , this was not an inpatient issue to urgently pursue at this time.
pt&apos;s Hct on discharge ( 34.6 ) was around his baseline. the renal team agreed
with GI&apos;s assessment.
-pt has outpt GI appt on 6/20/05 at 10AM with Dr Picozzi ( 059-631-4196 )

sugars again on AM 2/30/05 , so will send out on lantus 6 qhs and should
closely monitor bs and titrate lantus/novolog SS qAC appropriately. pt will
most likely require a bedtime snack to avoid his early morning hypoglycemic
episodes.

*************************Hospital Course********************
1.CV ISCH: Elevated ck , tni ( - ) , ckmb low , ruled out X3 cont.
Beta Blocker , ASA , non-occlusive 2vd on cath.
PUMP: warm and wet; the patient was diresed approximately 6 Liters to
her dry weight of 149 kilograms. At dry weight patient had a BNP
of 3700. In house her ACE was switched to Cozaar secondary to cough.
Beta Blocker was changed to once a day Atenolol. An echo on 8/28
revealed EF 21% mV moderate mr , incomplete closure , TV: moderate tr ,
incomplete closure;LV globak HK , rv mildly to moderately decreased ,
incomplete study due to patient not fully cooperating. On the patients
final day in the hospital she was noted to have symptomatic dehydra
tion and was orthostatic - symptoms resoved with a 500 cc NS bolus.
2.ENDO : the patient&apos;s insulin regiment was modified and she was dc&apos;d
on insulin 70/30 10 am. THe patient&apos;s admission regimine of Lantus 40 q
d was causing both hyper and hypoglycemia in house. Her hospital course
was notable for a few episodes of hypoglycemia resulting in down
titration of insulin AM and PM doses. THe patient was noted to be
extremely hypoglycmeic on 8 units of 70/30 in the PM and the PM
insulin was discontinued for the time being. It was decided that the
patient&apos;s diet at home would have higher glucose and carbohydrate
content and her Fs&apos;s will need further w/up as outpatient. We reccomend
titrating the 70/30 insulin up as needed.
3.GI: she complained of mild epigastric pain after meals , and said it
is thought that this represents diabetic gastroparesis. Her reglan
dose was increased to 10 and she tolerated PO&apos;s better subsequently and
was less symptomatic.
4.HEME: cont coumadin
5.PROPHYLAXIS: coumadin , nexium

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please followup with Dr. Scarles in 1-2 weeks
2. Please switch your insulin to 10 units of 70/30 insulin the morning.
Your primary doctor may make changes in your insulin regimin
based on your recorded blood sugars.
3. Please stop taking Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
4. Please start taking Cozaar and Atenolol. Your Reglan dose is
increased.
5. VNA for diabetes management , CHF management , and medical compliance.

*********************
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.DYSPNEA: The patient presented with increased dyspnea on exertion ,
likely secondary to CHF with preserved ejection fraction. Her EKG was
without changes from prior and her cardiac enzymes were cycled and
negative x3. She was given 40mg IV lasix with approx 2L diuresis daily.
Her weight at discharge was 127.3kg. Her admission weight was 131.5kg.
She had an ECHO which showed an EF of 55% and 1-2+MR with slightly
elevated PA pressure. This was unchanged from her previous ECHO in 2003.
Her CXR did not show any acute process. She had a DDimer of 2300. LENIS
showed no evidence of a DVT and on 7/18 she had a CT with PE protocol which
showed no evidence of a DVT or PE. She was given mucomyst for this for
renal protection. She was continued on her CPAP for OSA.
2. HTN: The patient was continued on her avapro and Imdur. Her diltiazem
and atenolol doses were decreased as she was having bradycardia with rates
in the 40s on the first day of her hospital stay.
3. CAD: The patient was continued on her imdur , beta blocker , and aspirin.
Her plavix was held as she was holding this as an outpatient for upcoming
cataract surgery. Her last stent was 2001 and she was given permission by
her outpatient cardiologist to hold this.
4. DM: Her avandia and metformin were held and she was continued on her
NPH and a sliding scale.
5. RENAL: Her Cr. was 1.4 at admission and improved to 1.1 with diuresis.
She was given mucomyst for renal protection.

call your doctor if your weight is increasing. Eat a diet low in salt
( less than 2 grams ).

4. Please have your PCP Dr. Nickless check your creatinine on Friday November This has been arranged and her office will contact you.
5. Please call Dr. Lychwala for a follow up appointment.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Please follow patient&apos;s Cr. She received contrast for a CT.
2. Please adjust BP meds. Her atenolol dose was decreased because her
heart rate was in the 40s.
3. Please evaluate her anemia. Her Hct was in the low 30s while in the
hospital.

amputations of the bilateral feet with 2+ femoral pulses and
palpable DP and PT pulses bilaterally with right greater than left.
There was no evidence of cellulitis with a necrotic left fourth
toe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Vascular: The patient was admitted for the left fourth toe
amputation , which occurred on April . This wound
was left open. She tolerated the procedure well with a VAC change
occurring on August at the bedside. At that time , it was noted
that , although , there was pink granulation tissue , the fifth toe
had become ischemic and nonviable. Therefore , the patient was
taken to the operating room on August for a left fifth toe
amputation , which was also left open. That was tolerated well , but
did not seem to be viable secondary to ischemia and infection.
Therefore , on March , 2002 , she was taken to the operating room
for a left transmetatarsal amputation of the third , fourth and
fifth toes. Dressing changes , wet-to-dry , were done. During that
time , it was noted that additional necrotic debris at the lateral
aspect of the foot required more debridement , so she was taken to
surgery on April for debridement and a partial resection of
the left fifth metatarsal. A VAC was placed and changed on
March at the bedside. On October , 2002 , the wound was
felt to be clean enough and a split thickness skin graft was placed
on the left foot , 75 square cm , and the donor site was the left
thigh. This seemed to be taking well. We continued with dressing
changes and a heat lamp to the donor site , which healed well. On
February , 2002 , we took her to the operating room again for
debridement of the left foot. The plantar aspect of the skin graft
had become discolored and we felt the infection required
debridement. Intraoperatively , the bone did not seem to be
involved and , at this point , we had been continuing wet-to-dry
dressing changes and , as of January , 2002 , the plan was to take
the patient to the operating room on January , 2002 for another
skin graft. Now that the wound is clean , she has completed
antibiotics.
2. Neurological: The patient has a history of a seizure disorder ,
which has been stable on Gabitril. She is
status post stroke and is stable. For her depression , she receives
Prozac. Her pain is well controlled on a Fentanyl patch with
oxycodone for p.r.n. pain and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. The
patient also has occasional dizziness and this is treated with
p.r.n. meclizine.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient has coronary artery disease and is
status post a myocardial infarction , and
hypertension , which is currently well controlled on Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d.
4. Respiratory: The patient has asthma that has been stable and
not evidenced in the hospital.
5. GI: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease , which is treated with esomeprazole. She is on a
diabetic diet. She receives Colace , Senna , multivitamins , folic
acid and Niferex.
6. GU: The patient is receiving Lasix 100 mg b.i.d. at this
moment. Her admission creatinine was 0.7 , peaked at 2.0
on February , at which time we called a renal consultation , who
said she was probably pre-renal acute renal failure secondary to
ace inhibitor , Lasix and a new bunch of antibiotics. At that time
we held the ace inhibitor , held the Lasix , and renally dosed the
antibiotics , at which time her creatinine came down to 1.1 , which
is closer to her baseline. We have slowly restarted Lasix and she
has tolerated that. We have since discontinued her antibiotics.
7. Heme: The patient&apos;s admission hematocrit was 25.7 , for which
she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells on
April . She received another unit of packed red blood cells on
November and her most recent hematocrit , on January , was 26.8.
Therefore , she is baseline anemic.
8. Infectious Disease: This has been another major issue for this
patient. Starting from the beginning , on
October , the patient had a urinary tract infection with mixed
flora , for which she was treated with a five day course of Diflucan
for Candida. On April , a wound culture of the left foot
showed Pseudomonas , which was resistant to multiple drugs ,
multidrug resistant E. coli , and methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus , as well as multidrug resistant Klebsiella.
On February , when we went to the operating room for further
debridement of the left foot , we obtained deep cultures from the
operating room and found Pseudomonas diphtheroid and Klebsiella ,
which were sensitive to vancomycin and cefotaxime. Infectious
Disease had consulted on our patient and recommended vancomycin ,
cefepime and Flagyl and a two week course of these antibiotics for
a soft tissue infection. It did not appear in the operating room
again that the bone was involved in the infection. An MRI on
August , however , showed soft tissue swelling in the sinus
tract that was suspicious for osteomyelitis of the fifth
metatarsal , but , in consultation with Infectious Disease , Vascular
Surgery , her operative findings , and clinical picture , we decided
it looked more like a soft tissue infection and treated her for two
weeks with antibiotics.
9. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus and her blood
sugar control has been an issue throughout her
hospital stay , slowly titrating up to her current Lantus dose of
150 units subq q.h.s. She seems to be doing well with that.
10. Ophthalmology: The patient is status post bilateral cataract
surgery and attempted filter for glaucoma in
the right eye and high pressure with pain , and proliferative
retinopathy with bilateral traction detachment. She was taking the
following medications: Pred Forte , Cosopt , ofloxacin , and Alphagan
for her eyes. On August , she had an Ophthalmology appointment
for floaters and that diagnosis was proliferative diabetic
retinopathy , status post pan retinal phototherapy with vitreous
hemorrhage. On October , she had an appointment with Dr. Saulsbury at
277-598-1768 , who recommended to add timolol to her eye drops , and
will be following up with her.
11. Dental: The patient had an appointment on July , where
they recommended a root canal of #18 and #19 for
caries. This root canal was done on January . The number of the
clinic is 210-793-1150.
12. Skin: The patient received Lotrimin , miconazole and wound
care to her right foot with Regranex. The left foot is
receiving wet-to-dries q.d.
13. Tubes , lines and drains: The patient had a right PICC line
placed on October , 2002.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Neurological: Continue.
Cardiac: Continue.
Respiratory: Continue.
GI: Continue.
GU: Continue with monitoring of creatinine.
Heme: Continue with monitoring of hospital course.
Infectious Disease: No antibiotics needed , but follow left wound
closely and she is positive for methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus , so she will need to be in
isolation.
Endocrine: Blood sugar control.
Ophthalmology: She need follow-up with her ophthalmologist about
her retinopathy , bilateral detachment and glaucoma.
Dental: She had a root canal done and will need follow-up.
Vascular: Will need to follow her bilateral extremity examination
and the skin graft to her left foot to ensure proper
healing. As well , she will be needing rehabilitation secondary to
weakness and decreased mobility after these amputations. She is
heel weight bearing on the left , weight bearing as tolerated on the
right. Goals will be to have bed mobility , transfers , daily
therapy with exercise , and the goal will be to ambulate 25 feet
with the least restrictive device.

Discharge Date: 5/27/2007
ATTENDING: OBEY , LAWRENCE MD
SERVICE: Obstetrics/Maternal Fetal Medicine.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pre-gestational diabetes.
2. History of coronary artery disease.
3. Recurrent SABs
4. Hepatitis B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old G16 ,
P0-0-15-0 , who presented at 6 and 4/7 weeks by LMP
consistent with ultrasound of the day of admission , as a transfer
from the High-Risk Obstetric Clinic , admitted to the Fuller
Antepartum Service for diabetic control. The patient had
presented to the Special OB Clinic as a new patient for prenatal
care. Review of her medical problems revealed that the recent
glucose control had been suboptimal. In view of this and in view
of the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , the
patient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of her
insulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medical
problems.
History of present pregnancy: the patient had a last
menstrual period in the second week of October . Ultrasound on the
day of admission , 9/5/07 , revealed a 6.6-week intrauterine
pregnancy with a fetal heart rate of 110. The estimated date of
confinement is 4/19/07. Prenatal screening labs were pending at
the time of admission. The patient has blood group O +ve.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of ST elevation
myocardial infarction in 2000. The infarct was a presumed
embolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronary
artery. The complete occlusion of the mid-to-distal left
anterior descending artery , which was thought to be due to
thrombosis , was treated with TPA and angioplasty. The patient had
a normal catheterization in October 2000. The last echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 45% in 2002; however , the
patient never had a repeat echo since that time. On the day of
admission , the patient reported that she was able to climb four
flights of stairs to her apartment , haveing to pause after two flights of
stairs to catch her breath.
In addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000.
The patient had a medical admission in 2006 for hypoglycemia when she
incidentally injected Humalog instead of Lantus. On the day of admission , the
patient was on a Humalog 7 units b.i.d. and Lantus 12 units in
the evening. Her fasting sugars were in the 150s before admission and her
blood sugar measurements were over 200 in the evening. On the day of
admission , the fasting sugar was 123.
In addition , the patient has a history of hepatitis B ,
diagnosed in 2005. The patient had a positive E antigen in 2005.
She had previously been on Epivir 150 mg p.o. daily , but this
was stopped prior to the current pregnancy.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: The patient has a history of a fibroid
uterus , and a history of recurrent miscarriages. In terms of the
fibroid uterus , the patient did report pelvic pain in the
outpatient setting. Ultrasound had shown an 8-10 cm
dominant posterior fibroid. The patient occasionally takes
oxycodone for fibroid pain.
In terms of the patient&apos;s recurrent miscarriages , the patient had fifteen SABs
in the past with over 10 dilatation and evacuations , including one molar
pregnancy with subsequent choriocarcinoma. All losses were in the first
trimester , less than 12 weeks&apos; gestation. The patient had been
evaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this had
been negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation ,
which was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether this
has been addressed previously. The patient had previously been
told by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consider
adoption or a gestational carrier. Chromosomes on several
pathology specimens from the previous abortions showed
aneuploidy.
The patient currently denies a history of sexually
transmitted infections. She has a history of cervical dysplasia ,
with a history of CIN I and CIN II in 1990 and 1992. She
underwent a LEEP in 1992 , which was consistent with HSIL. All
subsequent Pap smears were either within normal limits. Last Pap
smear done in February 2006 at Rexmo Sha Hospital Of was insufficient for
analysis. In terms of the patient&apos;s history of choriocarcinoma , the patient
had a molar pregnancy , which then developed into a subsequent choriocarcinoma.
For this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan ,
then VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Dilatation and evacuation x10 ,
hysteroscopy for infertility workup , and LEEP.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Humalog Insulin 7 units twice a day ,
Lantus 12 units in the evening , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily stopped
prior to pregnancy , history of lamivudine/Epivir use , 150 daily
stopped prior to current pregnancy.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Former smoker , given up smoking in 2000 after a
myocardial infarct. No history of alcohol abuse or IV drug use.
The patient lives in Doreska Dr , Nah Min Knox with her boyfriend , unemployed.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of GYN malignancies , history of
maternal diabetes , longstanding. Father with coronary artery
disease in his 50s.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primary
purpose of diabetic control.
1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient had reported poor diabetic
control as an outpatient. Therefore , her regimen was continued ,
with the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine the
additional insulin needs as an outpatient. Over the course of
the admission , the patient&apos;s Lantus was increased to 20 units at
nighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulin
lispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. With this
regimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and the
fasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. On the day
prior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the range
from 93 to 139. An HbA1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during this
admission , the patient also had a Nutrition consult. She will be
followed in the High-Risk Obstetric and Diabetic Clinic by Dr.
Borguez
2. Cardiology. The patient was restarted on her aspirin , given
her history of myocardial infarct at a very early age. In
addition , an echocardiogram was obtained on the day after
admission. This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well as
a large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be a
longstanding. Cardiology was consulted and the impression was
that the thrombosis was likely a combination of her left
ventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as well
as her hypercoagulable state. Therefore , their recommendation
was to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of this
pregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mg
daily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to be
continued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. The
Cardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had not
resulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. However ,
they did agree that folate supplementation at high doses was
indicated. The patient will be continued on Lovenox 90 mg daily
subcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.
She will have Cardiology followup with Dr. Jasper Erps on
3/6/07. During the entire admission , she was hemodynamically
stable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain ,
shortness of breath or palpitations.
3. Hepatitis B. The patient had liver function tests and a
hepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of active
disease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis E antigen.
On admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had been
stopped prior to this current pregnancy. Liver function tests
were checked on this admission and were within normal limits. In
addition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis E antigen and
the E antibody was negative. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B
core antigen were reactive. At the time of this dictation , a
hepatitis B viral load was pending. Given the patient&apos;s history
of hepatitis B , an outpatient appointment was being arranged at
the time of discharge , with Dr. Lavy , from the Division of
Gastroenterology at the Sasspan Hospital . It was
decided that the patient should not take any lamivudine until
Gastroenterology followup. During the entire hospital stay , the
patient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regular
diet , and having normal regular bowel movements.
4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroid
on her ultrasound scan. She required rare intermittent doses of
oxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be related
to her fibroid uterus.
5. Prenatal care. The patient had her first trimester labs sent
on this admission. GC and chlamydia testing were negative.
Urine culture was negative. The patient was O +ve. Given the
patient&apos;s history of MTHFR mutation and the recurrent SABs , the
patient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dose
folic acid , B12 and B6. In view of the patient&apos;s diabetic
history , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospital
day 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , the
patient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returned
negative at 92 mg per 24 hours. It was noted that the patient
had an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital health
center this year. For the remainder of this pregnancy , it was
noted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17
weeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing for
pre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy.
The patient was discharged in a stable condition , with followup
appointments arranged for the various specialties.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA/PAROXYSMAL
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 54 year old man status
post AVR admitted for tachycardia.
Patient is a 54 year old with history of high blood pressure and
status post aortic valve replacement with homograft for chronic AI
from bicuspid aortic valve. His postoperative course was
complicated by prolonged fevers , he had multiple blood cultures
drawn and only one culture grew Hemophilus parahaemolyticus in the
sputum , and only one out of many blood cultures grew coagulase
negative Staphylococcus. He was discharged from the surgical
service on July , 1996 on Lopressor and Percocet. He was sent
home feeling well except for persistent low grade temperatures.
One day prior to admission , patient had mild shortness of breath
but denied orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with no chest
pain. He awoke the morning of admission with no complaints but was
found by VNA to have a rapid heart rate and was sent to the
Emergency Room. Patient denied shortness of breath , dyspnea on
exertion , cough , pleuritic chest pain , dizziness , and palpitations.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included: 1 ) Status post AVR for AI from
bicuspid aortic valve as above. 2 ) History
of polio in 1955. 3 ) Hypertension. 4 ) History of knee surgery.

clothing industry , and denied cigarette and
alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease and negative
for cardiomyopathy , deep venous thrombosis , and
pulmonary embolus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a healthy appearing male alert in no
apparent distress. Temperature was 99.1 ,
blood pressure 118/70 , pulse of 90 , and 97% O2 saturations on two
liters of oxygen. HEENT: Oropharynx was clear with pupils equally
round and reactive to light and extraocular movements intact.
NECK: Supple with no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous
distention , and carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN:
Soft , good bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended , and no
hepatosplenomegaly. RECTAL: Examination was negative for blood.
EXTREMITIES: No edema. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , SMA 7 significant for
potassium of 4.6 , BUN of 19 , and
creatinine 0.9 , white count was 10 , hematocrit of 33.6 , platelet
count of 377 , PT 13.8 with INR of 1.3 , and PTT of 23.6. Chest
x-ray showed no infiltrate and no effusion. EKG showed atrial
flutter at 156 , borderline left ventricular hypertrophy initially
then after 5 mg of intravenous Verapamil , he converted to atrial
fibrillation at 100 , and there were no specific ST-T wave changes.
He also underwent VQ scan which showed high intermediate
probability scan.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology B
service for management of atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter and question of pulmonary embolus. He
was heparinized and was continued on Lopressor for rate control.
He was placed on cardiac monitor. In addition because of the low
grade fevers , more blood cultures were obtained. He underwent a PA
gram on January , 1996 which showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism , normal right heart pressures , and bibasilar subsegmental
atelectasis. Patient was begun on Coumadin and he was also seen by
infectious disease consultation who felt that he should be off all
antibiotics. He also underwent a transesophageal echo on January ,
1996 which showed mildly dilated left ventricle with low normal
systolic function , aortic homograft with no vegetation or fluid
collection around the annulus , trace aortic insufficiency was
present , mitral valve was mildly thickened with 1+ mitral
regurgitation but no obvious vegetations , tricuspid and pulmonic
valves were normal with no vegetations , and left atrium was also
normal with no thrombus. Patient continued to have low grade
fevers with no obvious evidence of infection and infectious disease
consultation service suggested that patient be discharged to home

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: SOB
HPI: This 36 yo woman has a history of asthma and obestity. She presents
with SOB and URI sx. She has previously been hospitalized for asthma , but
never intubated , and has never required ICU care. She was last treated
for an asthma flare one month ago. She has been unable to refill her
advair due to social pressures ( children at home ). She works as a pre-
school teacher and has been in frequent contact with sick children. For
the past week she has had increasing SOB , cough productive of white
sputum , and DOE after 1 block. Peak flow about 450 at baseline , 250 today.
Seen in urgent care and found to de-sat to 85% on RA on ambulation.
Referred to ED. There , VS 96.1 97 149/75 20 89 on RA. Treated w/ nebs ,
prednisone , lasix for pulmonary congestion seen on CXR , and levofloxacin
for possible RLL infiltrate on CXR.
ROS: postive for lightheadedness , blurred vision , chest fluttering. No
h/o calf pain.
PMH: Asthma , NIDDM , s/p c-section , tubal ligation , teratoma
removal. Meds: Albuterol , atrovent , metformin , zoloft , advair
All: NKDA
Soc Hx: Married , two children , no tob , no Etoh
Fam Hx: PE , father
Admission exam: 96.4 79 140/90 20 97% RA
Obese woman , speaking in complete sentences , NAD. RRR no MGR. Mild rhonchi
at RLL , otherwise infrequent wheezing. +BS s , nt , nd. 1+ edema in le&apos;s ,
ulcer on R shin w/erythema tracking down leg. Neuro non-focal.
Labs: Nl Chem 7. WBC 9.3 HCT 31 Plt 289 D-dimer 1132
A/P: 36 yo woman with h/o asthma , presents with SOB , URI sx , de-sat on
ambulation. Asthma flare most likely , though d-dimer concerning for
DVT/PE.
Hospital Course: The patient was treated with albuterol/advair nebulizers
and prednisone with rapid improvement. She was restarted on Advair , and
written for a prednisone taper for discharge. LENIS were performed which
excluded the diagnosis of DVT. The patient has no further hypoxia and
does not complain of pleuritic chest pain , and the diagnosis of PE is
low probability. She was also treated with 40mg IV lasix for pulmonary
edema seen on her CXR. Her BNP is 24 , which makes systolic dysfunction
unlikely ( recent ECHO shows EF 60% ). She should be followed as an outpt
for serial examinations and placed on lasix if she continues to have
signs of right heart failure suggesting diastolic dysfunction.
Finally , the patient is discharged on levofloxacin + clindamycin as
coverage for her LE cellulitis and RLL infiltrate.
She is encouraged to lose weight , and to follow up with her primary care
physician to obtain nutrition consultation and a plan for exercise to
achieve this aim.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. you have had a viral infection that worsened your asthma. You
should take Advair daily and albuterol only as you need it for
shortness of breath
2. you are being treated with antibiotics for 10 days for your
leg skin infection. You should keep your leg elevated as much as
possible over the next 10 days.
3. You should work with your primary care physician to help lose weight
to improve your breathing , fluid retention , and diabetes
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. take advair as scheduled
2. f/u wt gain with pcp

Discharge Date: 6/9/2000
SERVICE: Coll Lum All
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Pyelonephritis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Urinary tract infection. Bilateral adnexal
masses. Diabetes mellitus.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cristopher Ottilige is a 53 year old woman
with a history of diabetes mellitus
who presents with abdominal pain and fevers over two weeks
duration. Two weeks prior to admission , the patient had headaches ,
nausea , vomiting , presyncope , anorexia with mild periumbilical
pain. She also had fevers to 101 degrees F. with associated chills
and diaphoresis. The patient presented to her primary care
physician three days before admission and was found to have
elevated liver function tests with AST of 39 , ALT of 108. At that
time , the patient was presumed to have a viral syndrome. Two days
prior to admission , the patient developed worsening abdominal pain.
The pain was described as sharp , constant in character with
radiation to the back. The pain was more intense in the right
lower quadrant. The pain was also noted to be in the lower flanks
and the costovertebral angle area. The patient has noted no change
in her usual bowel habits of one stool per week. She has had no
diarrhea , constipation , melena , or hematochezia. She has had no
hematemesis. She denies any urinary symptoms but only has
nocturia. Of note , the patient had menopause approximately eight
years ago , but in each of the last three months she has noticed
monthly vaginal bleeding which she believes are a resumption of
menstrual cycles. The last episode was about one month ago. The
patient also has a history of nephrolithiasis but feels that this
current pain is different from the one she has had in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetes
mellitus diagnosed two years ago , obesity ,
obstructive sleep apnea , nephrolithiasis , osteoarthritis , glaucoma.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for cesarean section 20 years ago
that was complicated by pulmonary embolism.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Lasix 60 mg q day. 2. Glyburide 5 mg
q day. 3. Labetalol 200 mg b.i.d.
4. Timoptic , Xylatan drops for glaucoma.
ALLERGIES: Lidocaine leads to rash. Lisinopril leads to cough.
Diltiazem leads to edema. Nifedipine leads to edema.
Intravenous contrast leads to hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for cardiovascular disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and has two children. She
denies any use of alcohol or tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 102 , heart rate 90 , respiratory
rate 34 , blood pressure 143/48. Oxygen
saturation 91% on 2 liters nasal cannula. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular muscles
intact. Anicteric sclerae. Oropharynx clear. No jugular venous
distension. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs. ABDOMEN:
Obese and fairly firm. Diffusely tender to palpation. Increased
right lower quadrant pain. Rebound tenderness and mild guarding.
Bowel sounds are present but decreased. BACK: No costovertebral
angle tenderness. CERVIX: Cervical motion tenderness is present.
NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY: Chemistries revealed sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 94 , CO2 32 , BUN 13 , creatinine 1. Glucose
315 , calcium 9.9. Liver function tests showed ALT 58 , AST 23 , ALK
127 , total bilirubin 1.2 , albumin 4.6 , globulin 3.1 , amylase 28 ,
lipase 145 , total protein 7.7. The complete blood cell count
revealed a white blood cell count of 23.91 , hemoglobin 14.1 ,
hematocrit 41.8 , platelets 520. The differential showed 77 polys ,
7 bands , 6 lymphocytes , and 6 monocytes. The urinalysis was
notable for pH 5.5 , protein 1+ , glucose 1+ , leukocytes 1+ , nitrite
positive , trace ketones , and no blood. Sediments showed white
blood cells 45 - 50 , 4+ bacteria , 1+ squamous epithelial cells , 1 -
2 casts. Abdominal CT was notable for a 7 x 8 cm low density fluid
collection in the region of the right adnexa and a 4 x 8 cm low
density fluid collection in the left adnexa. A UCG was negative.
PROCEDURES: September , 2000 , endometrial biopsy. The procedure
was limited due to the patient&apos;s body habitus. The
biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. Complications none.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By systems:
1. GENITOURINARY. The patient&apos;s presenting
symptoms and abdominal CT findings of bilateral adnexal masses were
suspicious for a tubo-ovarian abscess. However , the patient did
not have any of the associated risk factors , given that the patient
is not sexually active and denied introducing any foreign objects
into the vagina. The patient was initially managed on triple
antibiotics , ampicillin , gentamicin , and Clindamycin. Since a CT
scan is not the optimal test to evaluate the adnexa , a transvaginal
ultrasound was ordered which revealed endometrial thickness of 3.6
mm and bilateral cystic masses. The patient&apos;s right upper quadrant
pain and tenderness persisted for several days during the admission
with periodic exacerbations and was increasingly suspicious for
cholelithiasis or pancreatitis. The patient then had an abdominal
ultrasound which was essentially was within normal limits and
showed no abnormal viscera. The bilateral adnexal masses continued
to be of major concern , and interventional radiology was consulted
for possible aspiration. Given that the etiology of the masses was
unclear and the risk of malignancy in a post menopausal woman , it
was decided that the best approach would be open tissue sampling.
It was then decided to postpone this procedure pending further
evaluation of the patient. Of note , the patient had a CA-125 drawn
which 77. Serum HCG was negative. The patient&apos;s report of new
onset of post menopausal bleeding was concerning. Considering the
high likelihood of malignancy , the patient was being followed by
the gynecology oncology service and underwent endometrial biopsy
for tissue sampling. The biopsy revealed no evidence of
malignancy. The patient had a repeat CT scan on hospital day
number seven which was essentially unchanged from admission showing
persistent bilateral adnexal masses and no free fluid. The
patient&apos;s symptoms of right lower quadrant pain persisted but
became more responsive to treatment toward the end of the
admission. Throughout the admission the actual etiology of the
bilateral adnexal masses was never discerned. As a result , the
patient was referred to the gynecology oncology service for
continued follow up as an outpatient.
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The patient&apos;s presentation of fevers ,
chills , and diaphoresis was certainly suspicious for infectious
process. Initially the patient was covered with ampicillin ,
gentamicin , and Clindamycin for empiric antimicrobial coverage.
The urine culture was notable for greater than 100 , 000 Escherichia
coli which was pan sensitive. All blood cultures at initial
presentation had been negative. On October , the creatinine
level increased to 1.8. As a result , gentamicin was then switched
to Levofloxacin. The patient&apos;s fever initially defervesced from
102.2 to 99.3 , but spiked to 100.1 after six days of antibiotics.
Her white blood cell count remained elevated and ranged from 24 to
32. However , by discharge the white blood cell count was 10.
Because of the patient&apos;s initial minimal response to antibiotics ,
repeat blood cultures and urine cultures were sent which were
negative. In addition , ID was consulted to provide further
guidance regarding antimicrobial management. They recommended to
continue ampicillin and Levofloxacin. Clindamycin was changed to
Flagyl. By discharge , the patient was afebrile.
3. CARDIOVASCULAR. By hospital day number two , the patient was
noted to have increased lower extremity swelling and new bibasilar
crackles. The symptoms were suggestive of volume overload and
possibly congestive heart failure. A chest x-ray was notable for
bilateral atelectasis in the lower lobes but no pulmonary edema or
pleural effusions. A cardiac echocardiogram revealed normal
systolic function with ejection fraction of approximately 60% and
mild left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was treated with
Lasix and was aggressively diuresed. She responded well to
treatment.
4. NEUROLOGIC. The patient presented with abdominal pain and was
initially with Demerol and Vistaril. Initially the patient was
only minimally responsive to treatment , but over time she became
more responsive. By discharge , the patient was without pain.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. Glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q day. Labetalol 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. q 8 hours. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q
24 hours. Xalatan 1 drop OU q p.m. Timoptic 0.5% 1 drop OS q day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home and required no
services.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was advised to call her
primary care physician for fevers greater
than 100.5 , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain. The patient
was also advised to take her temperature every day. The patient
was scheduled to follow up with her primary care physician in one
week. She will also follow up with the gynecology oncology service
for further evaluation of bilateral adnexal masses and post
menopausal bleeding.

Discharge Date: 10/2/1998
DIAGNOSES: 1. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2. HERPES ZOSTER.
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history
of coronary artery disease , who was transferred to
Za Valley Hospital two days following an acute myocardial
infarction , for post myocardial infarction management. The patient
has known coronary artery disease , and is status post myocardial
infarction in 1998. At this time he underwent a two-vessel CABG
with a saphenous vein graft to the RCA and to the LAD. Since then ,
he claims that he has done very well with rare angina
( approximately two times a year ) which responds well to sublingual
nitroglycerin.
He underwent an exercise treadmill test in 1997 , that showed
inferolateral ST depressions with exercise , that were considered
non-diagnostic , secondary to LVH and some resting EKG
abnormalities.
On August , the patient noted 10 out of 10 chest pain while walking
with his family. He took sublingual nitroglycerin times three with
no relief. He was taken to Tioncollgos Memorial Hospital where an EKG
showed ST depressions in leads V2 through V4 , and T wave flattening
in V1 and V5. He also had T wave inversions in V2 through V4. The
patient was treated with intravenous heparin , intravenous
nitroglycerin , and beta blockers. He remained pain free after this
treatment. He eventually developed a Q wave in V1. During his
hospitalization at Frontnor Valley Medical Center , the patient was noted to have
an 11 beat run of V-tach on August , and was started on a lidocaine
drip. The lidocaine drip was stopped on September , and the
intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned. He was placed on nitro paste
on September , and his intravenous heparin was then stopped on January .
The patient was transferred to Hard Hospital on January
because he preferred to receive his care from his primary
cardiologist. He denies having any chest pain since his initial
pain on the seventh. He also denies shortness of breath ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , swelling , nausea ,
vomiting , or diaphoresis. He has been tolerating a regular diet.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post MI
in 1998 , and two-vessel CABG in 1998.
2. Exercise induced atrial fibrillation
noted in 1990 with no recurrence.
3. Prostate carcinoma status post
prostatectomy in 1986.
4. Malaria in 1944.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg
q.d. , nitro paste started at the outside hospital.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was recently widowed approximately
two months ago , and has been grieving. He is
close with his daughter. He denies any use of tobacco or alcohol.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: No tobacco , no hypertension , no family
history of significant cardiac disease , and
no known history of hypercholesterolemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant elderly man in no acute
distress , who was sitting up in bed. Vital
signs: the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 115/60. Heart
rate was 67. Respiration was 18. Room air saturation was 94%.
HEENT exam showed the patient to be anicteric , with intact
extraocular movements , and moist mucus membranes. The neck was
supple with jugular venous pressure noted , approximately 8
centimeters. The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with
no rales or wheezes.
The coronary exam showed regular rate and rhythm , with a 1/6
midsystolic murmur at the left sternal border , and no S3.
The abdominal examination showed a flat abdomen with active bowel
sounds , and a well-healed midline low abdominal scar consistent
with his prior prostatectomy. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly were
noted.
The extremity exam showed no edema , with 2+ femoral and posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.
On neurologic exam , the patient was alert and oriented times three
with cranial nerves III through XII intact and symmetric. The
motor examination was 5/5 throughout , with 1+ deep tendon reflexes
and downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORIES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL: CPK at admission was 2611 ,
with an MB fraction of 260.
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 100 , CO2 30 , BUN 20 , creatinine
1.0 , glucose 123. The white blood cell count was 8.4 , with a
hematocrit of 40 , and platelets of 160. LDH is 162. AST is 26.
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , with normal intervals. The
prior ST depressions had resolved , and there were Q waves in V1 and
V2. The T waves were flattened in V5 and V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac: the patient remained off of his heparin
drip and on his nitro paste , and had no further
episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. He underwent an
echocardiogram , which revealed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50% ,
and posterior/lateral hypokinesis in the left ventricle. There
were no valvular abnormalities. Because the patient had no further
episodes of chest pain , he did not undergo further evaluation , and
was discharged home. The plan is for him to undergo another
exercise test in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.
ID: The patient developed a temperature of 101.1 on his first day
of admission. He presented with a Foley catheter in place , which
was removed. A urinalysis and culture were negative. Blood
cultures were drawn and were negative , and a chest x-ray was normal
as well.
On hospital day number three , the patient was noted to have a
non-pruritic , non-painful , erythematous rash on the back of his
lower right buttock and the back of his right leg. The patient
claimed that this rash was completely asymptomatic , and he would
not know about it if no one had pointed it out.
On hospital day number four , it was noted that this rash had filled
up a dermatomal pattern on the back of his right leg , and it was
felt that this most likely represented an acute outbreak of herpes
zoster. The patient was not treated specifically for herpes , given
that he was asymptomatic , and we did not have any proven diagnosis.
However , we were confident enough of this that we felt that it
would explain his low grade temperatures.
Psych: The patient spoke openly about his sadness following the
loss of his wife , two months ago. He was seen by Social Services ,
as well as by the Souzion Hospital , who thought that the patient
was appropriately grieving , and appropriately sad. It was felt
that at the time of discharge , that the patient had proper social
support at home , and was properly responding to the death of his
wife. It was therefore felt that he did not need any acute
psychiatric evaluation.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home , in stable condition
on hospital day four. He will follow-up with his
cardiologist , Dr. Semprini , in approximately 5 days. He will be seen
by the Visiting Nurses Association , approximately two times a week ,
to check both his blood pressure and cardiac status , as well to
help insure that he is not developing a more severe depression.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The discharge medications include atenolol
25 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 12.5 mg p.o. q.
p.m. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 2.5 mg
p.o. q. evening , and Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.
The patient had been tolerating this regiment of medications at the
time of discharge.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: SLURRED SPEECH AND RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old right
handed female with a history of
hypertension who was in her usual state of health until 10 a.m.
when she noted , while in a seated position , after bending over to
pick up articles from the floor , had a sudden headache described as
a bifrontal burning sensation. Afterwards , she noted mucus from
the nose which lasted two to three minutes. She thought it was a
&quot;sinus headache&quot;. Over the next half hour , she noticed while
talking to her self , she had some slurred speech. She attempted to
walk and found that the right side of her body felt &quot;wobbly&quot; and it
was difficult to walk but she was able to walk into the kitchen and
get a glass of water. The slurred speech and right side body
weakness lasted for approximately one hour and improved until
&quot;normal levels&quot;.
For approximately five to six hours later , the slurred speech
returned and family members who arrived that her face was twisted
and she had slurred speech , and that she had to lift her right leg
up with her hands in order to get into the car. She ultimated that
with the first event , she had headache and nausea only with the
second event. She denied any vomiting or light headedness or
dizziness. There was no visual change such as diplopia.

abuse. The patient has three children , one son , two daughters , and
she is currently married. She is currently unemployed and has a
sixth grade education. She grew up in Sonford
FAMILY HISTORY: There is a positive family history of a
stroke in her father.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient appeared stated age. Vital
signs showed a blood pressure of 158/108 ,
temperature of 98.2 , heart rate of 88 , respiratory rate 16. The
neck was supple with meningismus. The lungs were clear. The heart
showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur. The abdomen was
benign. The extremities showed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
On neurologic examination the patient was awake , alert , and
oriented times three , attention with difficulty with days of the
week , and month of the year. Speech was spontaneous and fluent
with dysarthria. The patient refused to read or write. She has
normal naming repetition , and comprehension. There was no right or
left confusion. Calculation was poor , believed to be secondary to
her poor educational status. The cranial nerves not tested. The
bilateral visual fields were full , discs were sharp , fundus clear ,
pupils 4 mm reactive bilaterally to light and accommodation , and
were consentual. There was positive nystagmus on right gaze. She
has normal facial sensation with a right facial paresis in the
upper motor neuron distribution. She had normal palate and uvula.
Sternocleidomastoids were strong. The tongue was midline. On
motor examination the patient had mild increased tone of her right
body , no tremor and a positive drift of the right upper extremity.
Strength of the left upper and lower extremities displayed 5/5
strength in all major muscle groups. The left upper extremity had
upper motor neuron distribution weakness with decreased strength
and upper extremity extensors with strength being 4 minus of the
lower extremity with decreased flexor strength with EHL being 4
minus also. The deep tendon reflexes were slightly more brisk on
the right with 2+ with out going right toe. The left upper
extremity and right lower extremity were 2 and toe down going.
Sensory exam was normal to light touch and pin prick , temperature ,
position , and normal double simultaneous stimulation.
Coordination; The patient has normal finger to nose , heel to shin ,
and the right was not out of proportion to the weakness. Gait was
remarkable for decreased swing , positive for circumduction on the
right and Romberg was negative.

the brain was negative for any mass lesions noted; no shift , no
hemorrhage , no lacune. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM showed normal sinus
rhythm , 75; large left atrium with normal axis and intervals; no
ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the neurology
service and started on one aspirin per
day. The patient was then ordered to have a cardiac echocardiogram
and MRI of the head. Throughout her hospital course her clinical
symptoms improved tremendously , and the patient proved that she was
90% of her baseline. MRI was remarkable for small pontine lacuna
infarct on the left which corresponds highly with the patient&apos;s
clinical examination. A cardiac echocardiogram was normal. MRA
also showed small common carotid disease which will be followed up
with carotid Doppler ultrasound as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Improved.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. RIGHT-SIDED CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. TYPE II DIABETES.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. RIGHT SHOULDER PAIN.
4. HOOK WORM ENTERITIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year-old Hispanic
man with a history of a left-sided
cerebrovascular accident , with a dense right hemiparesis , who
presented to the Emergency Room at Villera Hospital Medical Center on
17 of September , complaining of left-sided facial numbness , and left upper
extremity numbness since awakening that morning. The patient has a
history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension
and hyperlipidemia , as well as a past history of a left hemispheric
stroke with a right-sided hemiparesis , who awoke the morning of
admission with left lip numbness. Over the subsequent few hours ,
the patient&apos;s numbness progressed to include the entire left
one-half of his face. By 10 o&apos;clock in the morning , his entire
left arm was also numb. His left lower extremity was also
involved. In the Emergency Room , an EKG was done , and revealed
subtle ST segment depressions in leads II , and V4 through V6 , as
well as .5 mm of ST depression in lead I. There were no comparison
EKGs available. The patient denied any chest pain , shortness of
breath , nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. Given his history of
myocardial infarction that he states may have occurred in the past ,
as well as numerous coronary risk factors , he was admitted for rule
out of myocardial infarction and evaluation of his left-sided
numbness.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Dyazide.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for: ( 1 ) Left-sided
cerebrovascular accident in 1989. ( 2 )
Hypertension. ( 3 ) Chronic right upper extremity pain after his
initial cerebrovascular accident. ( 4 ) Type II diabetes.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , with unknown reaction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a resident of Et ,
Call Eansirancea . He denies alcohol or tobacco use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin , Hispanic male in no
acute distress , and pleasant. His vital
signs were: Blood pressure 150/88 , with a pulse of 86 , and a
respiratory rate of 20. His saturation was 96% on room air. His
temperature was 98.4. HEENT: Pupils equal , round , reactive to
light and accommodation; extraocular muscles intact. Pharynx was
clear. Neck was supple without adenopathy. There was no increased
jugular venous pressure. Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally , with the exception of mild bibasilar crackles.
Cardiac exam showed regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border , with radiation to
the left axilla. Abdomen was soft , non-tender , with positive bowel
sounds. Extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema.
There were no cords and no Homan&apos;s sign was present. On
neurological exam , the patient showed cranial nerves II through XII
grossly intact. The patient did , however , have loss of the right
shoulder shrug. On motor exam , the patient was 5/5 in all major
muscle groups on the left-hand side , and 4/5 in all major muscle
groups on the right-hand side. The patient was also somewhat
hyperreflexic on the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski
was down going on the right , and withdrawal on the left. On
sensory exam , the patient had decreased pin prick on the left
aspect of the fact , from V1 to V3 , and numbness of the left upper
extremity. Light touch was intact bilaterally. Proprioception was
also intact bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ( on admission ): Included a potassium of 3.4 , a BUN
of 13 , a creatinine of 0.8 , a
glucose of 226. His white blood cell count was 6.3; his hematocrit
was 44.9 , and his platelet count was 196. AST and ALT were 21 and
31 , respectively. LDH was 155. Total bilirubin was 0.5.
Cholesterol was 201. Calcium was 10.2 , with an albumin of 4.7.
EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 75 , with .5 mm of ST
segment depression in lead I , and 1 mm of ST depression in leads II
and V4 through V6. Chest x-ray was clear bilaterally. There was
cardiomegaly present. There was question of a left lower lobe
opacity. There were no signs of congestive heart failure. Head CT
without contrast showed an old left centrum semiovale lesion ,
consistent with with a watershed infarct. There was no evidence of
acute bleed.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 63 year-old Hispanic male with
the following important medical issues to be
managed:
( 1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient presented without chest pain , but
EKG changes , including .5 mm of ST segment depression in lead I ,
and 1 mm of ST segment depression in leads II , and V4 through V6.
There was no prior EKG for comparison. Given his multiple cardiac
risk factors , a decision was made to rule the patient out for
myocardial infarction. His serial creatinine kinase levels were
67/74/115. Given the low levels , there was no MB fractionation
done. The patient also was placed on Holter monitor to attempt to
rule out a dysrhythmic etiology of his deficit. Holter showed
predominantly a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 442 to 98. There
were 7 atrial premature beats , and 5 ventricular premature beats ,
as well as a 12-beat run of supraventricular tachycardia at a rate
of 125 , and a 6-beat run of ventricular tachycardia at 144. All of
these were asymptomatic. The patient underwent transthoracic
echocardiography while an inpatient , to rule out a vegetative
source of emboli , which may have resulted in his change in
sensation. Echocardiogram demonstrated concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 65%. There was a
thickened aortic leaflet with calcification of the right and left
coronary cusps of the aortic valve. No shunt was visualized. The
patient had no occurrence of chest pain or shortness of breath
while admitted to the Louili Mi Hospital . These events
were thought to be entirely non-cardiac in nature , and he was
removed from Telemetry. The patient&apos;s hypertension was managed
with Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission , and
switched to 30 mg of Nifedipine XL p.o. q.d. as an outpatient. His
blood pressure should be followed as an outpatient , and additions
and adjustments made accordingly.
( 2 ) Neurologic. The patient was admitted with what appeared to be
a purse sensory defect of the right hemisphere , resulting in left
facial and upper extremity numbness. He was seen in consultation
by the Neurology Service. CT scan of the head without contrast in
the Emergency Room was negative for acute bleed. In the Emergency
Room , the patient received one enteric coated aspirin , and he was
not started on intravenous heparinization. It was unclear ,
initially , whether the etiology of this patient&apos;s change in
neurological status was secondary to embolic phenomena or possibly
a second watershed infarct. Given his negative echocardiogram of
the heart , as well as a negative Holter monitor , it was thought
that the etiology of this patient&apos;s left-sided facial numbness was
not cardiac in nature. It was the feeling of the Neurology Service
that the patient had experienced a right-sided subcortical infarct ,
probably in the right thalamus region. He was also noted to have
risk factors for small vessel disease , including hypertension and
diabetes. His numbness appeared to be resolving on aspirin alone;
however , on the second day of admission , the patient began to
develop dysarthria. There was concern that the patient was having
an evolving cerebrovascular accident that was involving the
brainstem , given tongue involvement. He was thus started on
intravenous heparinization. His dysarthria promptly resolved. He
underwent MRI with and without contrast of the head , three days
after the initial event , which demonstrated only right-sided small
vessel disease. There was no evidence of acute bleed or underlying
vascular abnormality. Given the small vessel disease in this
patient , he was taken off intravenous heparin and continued on one
aspirin a day. He did well during the remainder of his stay. He
was seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and Occupational
Therapy , who , in conjunction with the patient&apos;s family , believed
that he was at a somewhat decreased level of functioning from his
baseline , given his sensory changes. He is thus to be sent for
inpatient rehabilitation for his new cerebrovascular accident , and
then to be followed as an outpatient in Dr. Lacrosse &apos;s clinic. He
will continue on one aspirin a day for life. His right-sided
scapular and shoulder pain is chronic , after sustaining his initial
left-sided cerebrovascular accident. It should be treated with
physical therapy , including ultrasound and stretching maneuvers.
The patient was also placed on Naproxen for pain relief.
Muscle relaxants may be tried as an outpatient if the above stated
efforts do not help reduce this patient&apos;s pain.
( 3 ) Infectious disease. This patient had no infectious
complications while hospitalized. He was , however , found to have a
slight peripheral eosinophilia during this admission , and was
evaluated by O&amp;P of the stool. Stool evaluation showed moderate
hook worm eggs , as well as rare Trichuris trichiura eggs. He was
treated with three days of Mebendazole.
( 4 ) Endocrine. The patient has a history of Type II diabetes , on
Diabeta. The patient&apos;s blood glucose levels were checked by finger
stick four times daily , and were in the 190&apos;s to 240&apos;s range during
this admission. He was covered with a CZI sliding scale of regular
insulin. The patient was advised by Dietary on the American
Diabetic Association diet. He is to continue as an outpatient on
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.;
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Glyburide 5
mg p.o. b.i.d.; Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with meals; Nifedipine
XL 30 mg p.o. q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin 1/150 , one tablet
sublingually q.5 minutes times three , then call M.D.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 19 of July to
rehabilitation at Sco Hospital .
FOLLOW UP: He is to follow up in clinic with Dr. Hiers in EEN MEDICAL CENTER ,
at his first available appointment.
COMPLICATIONS: There were no complications during this stay.

Discharge Date: 2/10/1993
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: COMPLETE HEART BLOCK.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lahm is a 43 year old male
with Down&apos;s syndrome who was admitted
with multiple episodes of syncope over the prior 8-10 years. These
were characterized by emesis followed by loss of consciousness with
a question of seizure like activity. This had occurred on a yearly
basis for 8-10 years. Such an episode occurred on May At that
time , his mother brought him to the Harwelliew Oker Medical Centers Emergency Room
because he developed a facial hematoma after one of these episodes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In the Emergency Room he was noted to be
somewhat groggy with a brief episode of
apparent loss of consciousness with a question of apnea. He was
sent to head CT for a scan and at that time he vomiting with loss
of consciousness and a decrease in heart rate to 30 beats per
minute. He was intubated in the CT scan room , sedated and paralyzed
while the study was completed. When he arrived in the Intensive
Care Unit , he had a heart beat in the 20s with complete heart
block , which was transient and with subsequent return to normal
sinus rhythm. The remainder of his exam was remarkable for an S4
and I/VI systolic ejection murmur. NEURO: The neurological exam was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were normal. His EKG showed sinus
tachycardia with an axis of 0 , ST flattening in
leads V5 and V6 , I in L and a question of a Q in III. Chest X-ray
raised the question of an infiltrate in the left base. The head CT
was negative. His course in the MICU was as follows: He ruled out
for myocardial infarction , despite an elevated CK. The MB fraction
was negative on electrophoresis. On the morning of February , he
spiked a temperature to 102.3 and was begun on Penicillin. Later on
February he had an episode of complete heart block with asystole for
9 seconds. Otherwise , he alternated sinus tachycardia and second
degree heart block with runs of bradycardia at the rate of 30-40
and also tachycardia.
HOSPITAL COURSE: A temporary pacemaker was placed on February
through the left subclavian approach. At that
time , he was hemodynamically stable , except for intermittent
hypertension , which was treated with Nifedipine. He was
transferred to the Cardiology Wa Nas O on January , 1993 to await
pacemaker placement. He was switched from Nifedipine to Captopril
for treatment of his hypertension and his fever was treated with
Cefotetan for presumed aspiration pneumonia. This has resulted in a
delay in his pacemaker placement. He intermittently had a
pericardial friction rub on physical examination that was thought
to be most likely due to myocardial irritation by the pacing wire
implantation. One echocardiogram in a series did reveal a regional
wall motion abnormality that may have been a function of the
pacemaker wire as well. He remained afebrile and completed a course
of antibiotics for his presumed aspiration pneumonia , although
subsequent chest x-rays did not support that diagnosis. He
required replacement of his temporary pacemaker wire while awaiting
permanent pacemaker placement to decrease the risk of infection.
He underwent permanent pacemaker placement in the Operating Room
with anesthesia backup in case there was need for intubation
because the patient had difficulty remaining still. The pacemaker
replacement was performed on July , 1993. Intubation was not
necessary.
DISPOSITION: He tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to
home on May , 1993. MEDICATIONS: The medications at
discharge were: Kefzol 500mg q.i.d. for 3 days , and Lisinopril 10mg
p.o. q day. He will followup with Dr. Antis on March , 1993 and in
TYTAZE TH IONO VALLEY HEALTH with Dr. Filiberto Schie Secondary Diagnoses were pacemaker
placement and Down&apos;s syndrome.

Discharge Date: 8/27/1999
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old gentleman
who has a past medical history of
non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease ,
and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularization
procedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in August of
1998. Since that time his foot has become cool and the graft has
been noted to be occluded. He presents for a re-operation for
revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior to
the coronary artery bypass graft. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. Hypertension.
Peripheral vascular disease.
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Glucophage 850 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg
p.o. q.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Simvastatin 10
mg p.o. q.d. , and NPH 10 units subcu q.p.m.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: In 1991 he had a coronary artery bypass
graft. His postoperative course was
complicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managed
and he has been without recurrence since that time. In August of
1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibial
artery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein and
left common femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty ,
as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. After this
surgery , he had an uncomplicated postoperative course.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 and
does not use alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had no chest pain , shortness of breath ,
or angina since the time of his bypass. Just
prior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Frankie Krampitz of Harlsti Conon Memorial Medical Center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiac
standpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he has
done well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms since
his bypass surgery. Additionally , his preoperative angiogram
showed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximally
occluded with mid to distal reconstitution. Above the knee
popliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. Below the knee
popliteal was patent. There was diffuse proximal disease in the
peroneal and posterior tibial arteries. The posterior tibial
occludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis at
the anterior tibial origin. The dorsalis pedis is patent.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 2/10/99 the patient was brought to the
operating room where Dr. Moises performed a left
femoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. This went without
complications. The type of graft used as a 6 mm Dalcron graft.
The immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for a
palpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a Dopplerable
dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. The
patient had an ECG postoperatively that showed no significant
change to his preoperative ECG. He was started on heparin at 8
p.m. the day of surgery.
Of note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoretic
and nauseous. At that time an ECG was done that showed no
significant change and , throughout that episode , he had no
hemodynamic instability. This was likely secondary to having
gotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.
Throughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient was
mobilized with physical therapy. He had a Dopplerable dorsalis
pedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on left
side throughout his entire hospital course. However , the graft was
no longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was strongly
Dopplerable.
The patient was continued on heparin until his Coumadin reached the
high 1 level which was achieved on 1/25/99 when his INR was 1.6. At
this time his heparin was discontinued. The anticoagulation is on
for keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or stroke
reasons. The goal on his INR will be approximately 2 to 2.5. On
1/25/99 the patient was stable for discharge. His pulse examination
was notable for Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
tibial pulse and peroneal pulse.
The patient&apos;s record of Coumadin in response with INR is as
follows: On 2/10/99 the patient was started on Coumadin at which
point his INR was 1.0. On that day he got 5 mg of Coumadin. The
following day , 5/27/99 , his INR was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg of
Coumadin. On 8/17/99 the patient&apos;s INR was 1.2 and he got another 5
mg of Coumadin. On 10/15/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of Coumadin and
his INR was 1.2 at that time. On 6/8/99 the patient got 10 mg of
Coumadin and his INR was 1.6 the following day on the day of
discharge , 1/3/99. On the day of discharge , 1/25/99 , the patient
will get 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his predicted daily dose will be
roughly 7.5 mg of Coumadin p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. ( this is a critical medicine and he should
be on this at all times despite being on Coumadin ) , Colace 100 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , iron 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Glyburide 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
NPH insulin 15 units subcu q.a.m. , CZI insulin sliding scale to get
4 units of regular insulin for blood sugar over 201 to 250 , 6 units
of regular insulin for blood sugar of 251 to 300 , 8 units of
regular insulin for blood sugar of 301 to 350 , and 10 units for
blood sugar 351 to 400 and , greater than 400 , house officer is to
be called. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Demerol 50 to 100 mg p.o.
q4h p.r.n. pain , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucophage 850 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , and Coumadin p.o. q.d. to be dosed according to daily
anticoagulation tests as stated previously with INR goal of 2 to
2.5.

Discharge Date: 9/3/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SYNCOPE.
PROBLEMS: 1. SYNCOPE.
2. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION.
3. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old white male with
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy who was
admitted with syncope. He is status post myocardial infarction in
1979 and 1985 as well as a coronary artery bypass graft in 1987
with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to RCA , SVG to OMB. Over the past ten
years he has complained of increasing CHF symptoms including
dyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multiple
admits for exacerbations , the most recent from November to
March , 2001 for progressive fatigue. At that time a right
heart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he was
treated with aggressive diuresis. Angiography revealed occluded
SVGs and a patent LIMA. Dobutamine radionuclide study revealed
inferior and inferolateral infarct. There was no evidence of
revascularization. Evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosis
by liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.
He reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by the
Electrophysiology Service who performed an EP study which was
negative for provokable VT and since he is not a transplant
candidate it was felt that empiric ICD placement would not be in
his best interest. His light-headedness and presyncope worsened.
His captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. with
marked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. Over the past
weeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened with
episodes of presyncope and frank syncope. On the day of admission
he was scheduled for a clinic appointment. On arrival he felt
dizzy and &quot;crumpled&quot; with loss of consciousness and therefore was
admitted for further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 15% to 20% in February of 2001 ,
status post anterior MI in 1980 and 1986 , three vessel CABG in 1987
with LIMA to LAD , SVG to OM and SVG to PDA , type 2 diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent , hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis ,
gallstones , cardiac cirrhosis which is mild and was diagnosed in
February 2001 by abdominal ultrasound and liver scan , IBS , psoriasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
insulin 65 units subcu b.i.d. , Xanax p.r.n. , torsemide 120 mg p.o.
q.a.m. , torsemide 80 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Lying blood pressure
94/58 , heart rate 70 , oxygen
saturation 97% on room air. Sitting blood pressure 78/54. Patient
could not stand secondary to light-headedness to complete
orthostatic vital signs. Afebrile. General: Appearing
comfortable in a supine position. No acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular. Normal S1 , S2. No S3. JVP
approximately 5 cm. A II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex. Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No edema.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 91 ,
bicarbonate 22 , BUN 64 , creatinine 2.6 ,
glucose 348. White blood cell count 17.9 , hematocrit 37.6 ,
platelets 286.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old white male with history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary
artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy and probably cardiac
cirrhosis who presents with presyncope and syncope. The arrhythmia
was considered possible and there has been none documented and he
was not inducible two years prior to admission. Given his
orthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status and
medications were responsible for his symptoms. In addition his
elevated BUN and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.
He improved off diuretics , nitrates and ACE inhibitor as well as
liberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. There
were no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. An endocrine
consult was called to evaluate for possible contribution of
autonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. They
recommended decreasing his Synthroid dose due to a suppressed TSH
as well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they were
unable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that his
episodes of presyncope and syncope were related to his volume
status and medications rather than autonomic insufficiency.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be dictated on the actual day of
discharge.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Satisfactory.
DISPOSITION: Home with services.

Discharge Date: 10/12/2006
ATTENDING: SWEED , ZANE MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MRSA-infected abdominal mesh.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 90+-year-old male with a
complex past medical history including CAD status post stent x2 ,
hypertension , CHF with an EF of 10-20% , AF , on chronic
anticoagulation , status post pacer placement , and diabetes
mellitus who presented to the SICU status post exploratory
laparotomy for removal of chronically MRSA-infected mesh from
prior abdominal surgery. He was admitted to the ICU for
careful monitoring and fluid volume management
postoperatively. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. The
mesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. He
had since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures have
grown out MRSA. He was admitted preoperatively for reversal of
anticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. In the
operating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis of
adhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. He was closed and
one Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. During the procedure ,
he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedated
with Versed and fentanyl. He received intraoperative vancomycin
and levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer&apos;s. In an
attempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun but
then aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrine
injection , likely due to transfusion reaction. Another unit of
FFP was hung and tolerated well. EBL was 300 mL. Urine output
was 410 mL for the four-hour case. He was extubated uneventfully
and transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Colon cancer , status post colonoscopy in 2005 that was
negative.
2. Prostate cancer.
3. History of CVA with a left occipital infarct thought to be
due to embolic phenomenon.
4. History of TIAs.
5. Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine.
6. Chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
7. Sick sinus syndrome , status post pacer placement.
8. CAD status post MI in 2005 , status post stenting of LAD and
RCA.
9. CHF.
10 Spindle-cell tumors from lung.

17. Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Ether.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No alcohol or tobacco use. Married , lives with
wife , retired 25 years ago.
ADMISSION LABS: Remarkable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of
30.1% , INR of 1.7. EKG V-paced at 60 , no ST-T wave abnormalities
compared to preop.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: On admission , temperature
98 , pulse 60 and V-paced , blood pressure 140/85 , saturating 96%
on 3 L nasal cannula. Neuro: Awake , alert , appropriate.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no rales , no
wheezes. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nondistended , mildly tender
midline incision with dressing clean , dry and intact. JP in
midline with sanguinous drainage. Lax abdominal wall with
protuberance but soft. Extremities: Warm and well perfused.
IMAGING: Chest x-ray negative for acute disease and
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 90+-year-old gentleman with a complex
past medical history including CAD status post MI and stent x2 ,
CHF was admitted to the SICU , status post ex lap for removal of
MRSA-infected mesh for careful monitoring and fluid resuscitation
in light of cardiac status. His postoperative course was
remarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the JP drain ,
a question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in his
hematocrit. The heparin drip , which was initiated given the
patient&apos;s chronic AF , was discontinued and FFP administered.
Platelets were also given at the request of the Plastic Surgery
Team in light of aspirin and Plavix , which were continued due to
the patient&apos;s cardiac stents. Despite bolus Lasix , the patient
did develop CHF with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increased
oxygen requirement. Concomitantly , the patient also became
delirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation.
He developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calcium
channel blockers and IV ACE inhibitors in this setting. The
patient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemide
drip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleeding
and an elevated INR. He responded well to this regimen and
aggressive pulmonary toilet. Both the patient&apos;s PCP , Dr.
Gillice , and his cardiologist , Dr. Keks , did follow the
patient. His oxygenation never suffered during this time and he
did not have significant hypercarbia. He was eventually weaned
back to nasal cannula. He did have a mild transient elevation in
creatinine while on the Lasix drip but has since recovered back
to baseline off of the Lasix drip. His nasogastric tube was
removed on 5/18/06 and he tolerated ice chips without
difficulty. His home cardiac medications were restarted on
6/10/06. The patient was out of bed and ambulating without
difficulty. At the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip was
being weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. He is
anticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a red
blood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off.
PLAN:
Neuro:
1. The patient does sundown at home and has done so while in
the ICU. He has been much more calm and appropriate over the
past 24 to 36 hours.
2. He does experience more significant delirium with morphine
and less so with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n.
3. We will continue with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. , and Zyprexa
2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home regimen. Haldol is written p.r.n.
as needed.

RUQ u/s large complex liver cyst
MRI: 8 cm complex cystic hepatic lesion with mild enhancement. Despite
the peripheral location , the most likely diagnosis would be a biliary
cystadenoma. Other entities remained in the differential , however ,
including biliary cystadenocarcinoma , a thrombosed hemangioma , cystic
metastases , and infection ( hydatid or abscess ). If available , access to
any prior outside imaging would be helpful to distinguish these.
Otherwise , follow-up or biopsy could be considered. Nonenhancing cystic
lesion in the spleen , likely a splenic cyst or hemangioma.
*****************
Hospital Course:
73 yo with probable CAD , presents with abd/chest pressure. Was ruled out
for MI , and f/u MIBI actually demonstrated interval improvement in cardiac
disease. As the pain was epigastric in location , pursued further imaging
of liver cyst.
1. CV: R/o by negative enzymes x 3 , ASA , statin , BB. No recurrence of the
pain following admission. Stress PET on 6/26 did not demonstrate any
reversible perfusion defect ( unlike prior study 6/8 ). Will continue
current medications. Given elevated BP on admission ( and control on 25
lopressor TID ) , will increase toprol from 25 to 50mg PO daily. Pt should
followup with PCP and cardiologist for further adjustments as needed. Dr.
Largo was notified of the patient&apos;s admission.
2. Abd pain. Pain appeared to have abdominal component , and given absence
of cardiac disease , pain may have more likely originated may be biliary or
hepatic area. Patient was continued on PPI. A RUQ u/s demonstrated small
gallstones and a sizable hepatic cyst ( previously known ). The cyst was
then characterized by MRI , which revealed likely
cystadenoma per preliminary report. This lesion should be closely
followed , and surgical options should be evaluated. Furthermore , the
possibility of biliary pain should be considered given presence of small
gallstones and timing of pain. Referral for elective laproscopic
cholecystectomy should be considered.
3. Psych. depression/anxiety/bipolar. Continued home medications with no
changes during the hospital stay.
4. Heme. Anemia , chronic at baseline. Should be followed as outpatient.
5. Reported h/o diabetes. A1C was 4.5. No treatment was given.
6. Hyperthyroidism. Continued levoxyl. TSH 2.808.
7. Periodontal pain. Patient reported pain in gums , ? infection. The
patient was offered chlorhexidine mouthwash and encouraged to followup
with her dentist as soon as possible for evaluation.
Full Code
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Cardiac tests were normal. Continue to take all of your medications as
prior , except for Toprol XL , which you should take at a slightly higher
dose until talking with your primary doctor.
2. You have a cyst in your liver and should follow-up with your PCP to
discuss further evaluation.
3. If you have chest pain , worsening shortness of breath , nausea ,
vomiting or abdominal pain , please call your doctor or seek medical
attention
4. Seek follow up with your dentist for pain in gums.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Hepatobiliary cystadenoma: could consider surgical excision. Consider
gallbladder removal
2. Follow BP , as Toprol XL increased from 25 to 50mg daily.

Discharge Date: 2/1/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY NUMBNESS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Milo Barta is a 78-year-old
African American female with a
significant cardiac history , including hypertension , congestive
heart failure , history of afib -- patient is on Coumadin , CAD ,
status post MI , mitral valve replacement in 1995 or so , who was in
her usual state of health until the morning of admission , when she
says she awoke in a sweat , had a headache , and noticed she could
not stand. She felt that her left lower extremity was &quot;asleep&quot; and
weak. She called 911 , came to PCH . The patient also noted that
her speech seemed slurred at the time that she was unable to get
up. She denied any weakness or numbness in her other extremities
or face. She denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or visual
changes. She says she did note transient heart palpitations. She
denied fever , chills , nausea , and vomiting. In the ER the patient
was noted to have 2/5 left lower extremity power. She had no
apparent sensory deficits at that time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , and including noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , a status post left hip
replacement , history of DVT , status post mitral valve replacement
for mitral stenosis approximately eight years ago ( patient says she
has a history of rheumatic fever ) , and bilateral cataracts.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Norvasc 10 mg q. day , amiodarone 200 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and 2.5 mg
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , and Sunday , Lomotil 1-2 mg q.i.d.
p.r.n. , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient denied any history of tobacco , ethanol , or
illicit drug use. She lives alone and says she is
a very private person. She does all of her own activities of daily
living and walks with a cane.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s mother died of an MI and her father
apparently died of a PE. She has a son that died
of an MI as well.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to penicillin , sulfa drugs ,
and aspirin.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On being admitted to the hospital , the
patient was afebrile at 97.4 degrees
Fahrenheit , with a pulse of 68 , blood pressure of 190/90 , and
satting 98% on room air. Patient&apos;s exam showed that she had no
carotid bruits or JVD. Her heart exam was notable for a regular
rate and rhythm , as well as prosthetic S1. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally and abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities showed cool fingers on the right , with a 1+ pulse , and
warm well perfused fingers on the left , with a 2+ radial pulse.
Apparently , these extremity changes are long-standing and not new.
She had 2+ pulses in her posterior tibial pulses and trace pulses
in her dorsalis pedes pulses bilaterally. On neuro exam the
patient was alert and oriented x three. She exhibited good naming ,
comprehension , reading , and fluency. Cranial nerves II-XII were
intact bilaterally. On motor exam the patient had 5/5 power
everywhere except for the left lower extremity , with knee flexors ,
knee extensors , ankle flexors , and ankle extensors being 3+/5 and
hip flexors and hip extensors being 4-/5. Her tone was slightly
increased in her left lower extremity. On sensory exam she had
slightly reduced sensation to pinprick , light touch , and
temperature in both extremities to the hip. Deep tendon reflexes
were symmetric and 2+ throughout , with downgoing toes bilaterally.
Pertinent labs on admission showed a slightly increased creatinine
at 1.7 and a BUN of 31. The patient had a TSH of 1.09 and a total
cholesterol of 197 , with an LDL of 131. Her sed. rate was 14 and
her hematocrit was 40.2. INR was noted to be 1.7. CKs were flat
and the patient was ruled out for an MI.
IMPRESSION:
1. Neurologic: Given the patient&apos;s significant cardiac history
and subtherapeutic INR , it was considered that her left lower
extremity weakness that was transient was likely a transient
ischemic attack. The patient&apos;s motor deficits quickly improved
over her hospital stay and she felt she was back to baseline on the
day of discharge. Head CT and head MRI and MRA were negative for
any acute changes , including hemorrhage and infarction. On MRA the
patient was noted to have some proximal stenosis of her right
intracranial carotid and had also some atherosclerotic changes of
her PCAs bilaterally. The patient also had ATTE with a bubble
study that was negative for PFO. The patient was continued on her
Coumadin at 5 mg q.h.s. until her INR was therapeutic. During this
interval she was started on heparin and was therapeutic on that.
The patient is to follow up in the Coumadin clinic as well as
neurology clinic in one month. She is to have her Coumadin drawn
at three days after discharge to ensure that her INR is above 2.
Her Coumadin dosing regimen was slightly changed , with her taking
four doses of 5 mg a week and three doses of 2.5 mg a week. The
patient was seen by physical therapy , who cleared her to go home
and felt that she was okay to walk stairs with her walker.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has an extensive cardiac history
as detailed above. Her systolic blood pressure was calculated
between 120 and 160 during the first day of her hospital stay , as
it was unclear whether she had a serious carotid stenosis or not.
Her blood pressure meds were gradually added back. The patient had
several episodes of atypical chest pain , for which she was ruled
out with telemetry and enzymes , which were flat.
3. Endocrine: The patient was placed on a diabetic diet and was
continued on her glyburide. A hemoglobin A1C is pending at the
time of this dictation. She was covered with sliding scale insulin
during her hospital stay.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg q. day , Norvasc 10 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday , and Sunday , and
2.5 mg Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. ,
Lasix 40 mg q. day , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.

unresolved abdominal abscess. The patient is complaining of
persistent nausea and vomiting after eating and decreased
appetite , mild-to-moderate abdominal pain located in left upper
quadrant and right lower quadrant. She denies fever or chills
and has continued lethargy. No other symptom associated.
Patient has history of an unresolved abdominal abscess status
post appendectomy for a perforated appendicitis. She had
appendectomy on 9/21 and then returned on 11/10/04 with
increasing abdominal pain and CT showed abscess leaks and
perforated appendiceal stump. She was treated with amoxicillin ,
Flagyl and fluconazole , IR drain placed and patient discharged.
It was later removed and patient returned on 10/24/05 with a CT
showing reaccumulation of abscess fluid. Another IR drain was
placed and the patient was treated with IV antibiotics. Cultures
reported 4+ enterococci and 2+ Staph aureus , Bacteroides
thetaiotamicron , bifidobacterium species. Patient discharged on
2/9/05.

ssssDIAGNOSIS: HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA CRISIS.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
SHOCK.
C1 ESTERASE INHIBITOR DEFICIENCY
( HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA ).
OSTEOARTHRITIS.
HYPOTHYROIDISM.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71 year old with a
long history of hereditary angioedema ,
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , who presented with
sudden onset of abdominal pain , shock and atrial fibrillation. The
patient has a long history of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency ,
status post emergent tracheostomy times 3 in the distant past , as
well as a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the recent
past. She has failed Quinidine and Propafenone in the past , and
she is maintained in normal sinus rhythm on Sotalol. The patient
was admitted for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with increased
ventricular response and was treated with an increased Sotalol dose
and converted to normal sinus rhythm without electrical
cardioversion. The patient was most recently discharged on
10 of January Three days prior to this admission , the patient presented
with a flu-like illness with a temperature of 103 orally , and she
stayed in bed. The next day , she was afebrile and felt better. On
the day of admission , the patient awoke at 7:00 am with sudden
onset of excruciating abdominal pain and she called Meo. Bridbouldma Medical Center She went by ambulance there. She said this pain is
typical of her attacks , except was much worse than ever before. On
arrival at Sheph Name Memorial Hospital , the patient was found to be
hypotensive , clammy , and she was given C1 esterase inhibitor , but
remained persistently hypotensive and was transferred to Gic Hospital Her she had a systolic blood pressure of 60
and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. A CVL groin line was
placed and she was given vigorous intravenous fluid hydration. The
patient was started on Vancomycin , gentamicin and Flagyl to cover a
possible bowel source for sepsis. The pains rapidly decreased over
the next 2 hours , typical of her attacks , but still persisted
mildly. Her blood pressure stabilized and she remained afebrile.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included the C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency ,
hereditary angioedema , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , history of
subdural hematoma secondary to Coumadin , status post appendectomy ,
status post total abdominal hysterectomy , osteoarthritis.
ALLERGIES included multiple foods , sulfa , PCN , Novacaine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 95.8 ,
blood pressure 90/palpable , heart rate in
the 120&apos;s and irregularly irregular. Head , eyes , ears , nose and
throat examination showed pupils were equal , round , reactive to
light , extraocular movements were intact. Neck was without
swelling , without stridor , no adenopathy. Lungs were clear. Heart
had S1 , S2 , irregularly irregular. Abdomen was diffusely tender ,
positive bowel sounds , no rebound , slightly distended. Rectal
examination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination showed she
was alert and oriented times 3 , cranial nerves intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant values included blood urea
nitrogen 21 , creatinine 1.3 , white count
11 , hematocrit 53.2 , arterial blood gases were pH 7.4 , oxygen 413 ,
PCO2 32 , on 100% face mask. Abdominal computerized tomography scan
showed some thickening and some mild edema of her bowel wall , and
moderate to large amount of ascites with no evidence of
perforation. Chest x-ray was clear. The electrocardiogram showed
atrial fibrillation at 150 , normal axis and intervals , no ischemic
changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and given vigorous
intravenous fluids. Her Sotalol dose of 120
milligrams twice a day was increased to 160 milligrams twice a day.
Her Stanzolol dose of 2 milligrams by mouth every other day was
increased to 2 milligrams by mouth every 6 hours. The patient was
monitored very carefully , ruled out for myocardial infarction with
flat creatinine phosphokinase levels. Her abdominal pain was gone
by the next hospital day , and her electrolytes normalized. The
patient had some mild diarrhea , which slowly resolved , and she
remained in atrial fibrillation on the increased Sotalol dose. On
22 of July , the patient underwent DC-cardioversion and was given 100
joules times 2 , and then converted with 200 joules. She remained
in normal sinus rhythm. Her QTC was .467 on her increased dose of
Sotalol , and so she was maintained on this. The patient was
discharged in excellent condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were Sotalol 160 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Stanzolol 2 milligrams by mouth each day , Synthroid 15
micrograms by mouth each day , aspirin 1 by mouth each day. The
patient is to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Rufus Salvitti

s/p renal allograft complicated by cellular rejection on HD MWF ,
DMII , HTN , aortic stenosis s/p AVR ( porcine ) with simultaneous single
vessel CABG LIMA-&gt;LAD. Pt reports eating breakfast and taking morning
medications and then feeling lightheaded , diaphoretic , with his heart
racing. His symptoms began while he was sitting , but he stood up to
walk across the room and felt his symptoms worsen. He
remembers feeling more &quot;dizzy&quot; and &quot;unsteady&quot; and then remembers
being on the ground. He does not remember falling or lowering
himself , but he denies loss of consciousness. EMS was called to take
him to the
ED. On the ambulance he felt some substernal heaviness
and discomfort that lasted less than 1 hours. The feeling resolved
after receiving oxygen. He denies chest pain prior to fainting.
He has not felt well since his renal transplant complaining of
shortness of breath. He however notes increasing shortness of breath ,
cough , and fatigue over the past weeks. Denies fever , chills ,
edema , melena , bright red blood per rectum , hematochezia , dysuria ,
hematuria. He did feel nauseas after he
fainted.

Discharge Date: 1/18/2006
ATTENDING: MONTESINOS , DANA M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 90+-year-old man with
multiple medical problems , who was recently admitted for a delta
MS and found to have multiple posterior circulation infarcts ,
likely embolic in nature. He was discharged yesterday and now
presents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominal
distention. On admission also , noted to have increased sputum
production and therefore question aspiration event was considered
while at rehab. At his recent hospital stay , he was evaluated
for PFO , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic blood
pressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. Had a
troponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and was
considered to be demand related. At baseline , the patient lives
with his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requires
assistance with ADLs. On arrival on the floor , the patient had a
temperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , blood
pressure 180s/80s , and O2 saturation of 97% on three liters. His
abdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid and
had no peritoneal signs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Right hip fracture status post right hemiarthroplasty.
2. Non insulin-dependent diabetes.
3. Depression.
4. Psoriasis.
5. Leiomyoma.
6. Hypertension.
7. SVT.
8. History of GI bleed.
9. Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3
to 1.6.
10. Embolic stroke in October of 2006.
IMPORTANT STUDIES:
1. Chest PA and lateral dated 1/10/06 , increased opacification
seen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning for
pneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasis
was seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions are
possible , and heart size is normal.
2. Abdominal ultrasound on 3/1/06 : 1 ) Contracted gallbladder
with gallstones. No sonographic evidence for acute
cholecystitis. 2 ) Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. KUB dated 4/5/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , no
high-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact.
4. Urine culture on 4/5/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitive
E. coli.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient was found to have a pansensitive E. coli UTI and a
questionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likely
been due to aspiration given the patient&apos;s recent stroke and
documented aspiration by Speech and Swallow on previous
admission. The patient&apos;s white count , which was initially 19.8
on the day of admission trended down over the first three days of
his admission as he was treated with Levaquin. The Levaquin ,
which will cover both the urinary tract infection and the
possibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a total
of a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. The patient&apos;s blood
cultures showed no growth.
2. GU , the patient was found to have 1.5 mL of urine in his
bladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinary
retention. A Foley was placed and the patient drained the urine.
The patient was started on Flomax to improve his recovery from
the urethral obstruction. Most likely , the patient has
underlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recent
Foley placement during his previous admission. Then when he went
to rehab without the Foley ( note he did void several times prior
to discharge from the hospital ). The patient developed urinary
obstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infection
and requiring readmission. The Foley was kept in place until
hospital day four. When the Foley was taken out , the patient did
not void at all. A bladder scan ten hours after the Foley was
taken out revealed 432 mL of urine in his bladder. A Foley was
replaced in his bladder and Urology was consulted. Urology
recommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the Foley
should be left in place for seven days and then he is to follow
up with Dr. Booker Randgaard with the Foley still in place for a
voiding trial within a week after discharge.
3. Renal , the patient&apos;s creatinine at admission was 2.2 , which
is significantly above his baseline. This was attributed to
acute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. When
the Foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and on
the day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normal
range.
4. Cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive with
SBPs greater than 200 , particularly at night. Therefore , during
his hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated up
such that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen is
Lopressor 50 q.i.d. and Norvasc 10 daily. Blood pressures during
24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and his
heart rate ranged 64 to 82.
5. Endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o.
regimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. He
will be discharged on Lantus 12 , NovoLog sliding scale , and
tolbutamide 500 daily.
6. GI , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through the
course of his hospital stay. At admission , it was 206 and it
rose to 508. A GGT was drawn and found to also be elevated at
119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed ,
which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but no
acute cholecystitis. The patient was found to be constipated on
the day prior to discharge and was given a Dulcolax suppository ,
which had worked in the past.
7. Prophylaxis , the patient received Lovenox subcu daily.
CODE STATUS: The patient is DNI though he would want to be
resuscitated with CPR , defibrillated , and given pressors.
CONTACT INFORMATION: His son , Dr. Olen Stroebel , can be contacted
at 471-446-0880 or 167-100-0595. His wife can be contacted at
081-581-0406.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Urinary retention leading to urinary tract
infection , possible aspiration pneumonia.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE TO REHAB: Tylenol 325 mg p.o. q.6h.
p.r.n. pain , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Dulcolax 10 mg p.r.

Discharge Date: 1/26/2007
ATTENDING: STIVER , CALVIN MD
SERVICE: Coronary Care Unit.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kolppa was a 58-year-old
woman with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection
fraction of 15% who was initially admitted to the Faharb Medical Center Of following a cardiac arrest. On arrival in the
emergency department she was found to have recurrent ventricular
tachycardia and was defibrillated. She required an intraaortic
balloon pump to maintain her blood pressure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. She has a pacemaker/ICD. She has a history of
chronic kidney disease , deep venous thrombosis , history of
cerebrovascular accident , history of hypercholesterolemia ,
history of coronary artery disease , history of diabetes , history
of GI bleed and history of chronic hepatitis C.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Ms. Rubins had a complicated
course in the hospital and her care was related primarily to
recurrent ventricular tachycardia and prolonged anoxic injury
affecting multiple organ systems. During her hospital course ,
she required pressor medications , an intraaortic balloon pump ,
and ventilator support. Of note , the patient had noted , prior to her
admission , that she would never want to be dependent upon &quot;machines.&quot; Due to
poor neurological status and poor
prognosis , and in conjunction with the patient&apos;s previously expressed wishes ,
medical care was withdrawn on 4/25 after many discussions with family. The
patient&apos;s primary care physician , Dr Sangh , was involved with these
discussions. The intraaortic balloon pump was turned off. Pressure medications
were held and the mechanical ventilator was stopped. The patient passed away
on 11/17/07 shortly after removal of mechanical support.

Discharge Date: 10/13/1998
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES: Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 44-year-old gravida
5 , para 4 , with long-standing history
of menometrorrhagia with a known fibroid uterus. The patient has
been bleeding per vagina nearly everyday since 1994 , so heavily
such that in 11/16 , she presented to the Hare Atldilltute Health
with heavy bleeding and chest pain. At that time , her hematocrit
was 18 and she actually ruled in for a mild myocardial infarction.
She continues with heavy bleeding and she has a large cervical
fibroid that makes an endometrial biopsy impossible to perform in
the clinic. The patient was thus scheduled for a bilateral total
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy as she
does not desire to retain her ovaries.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Iron-deficiency anemia; ( 2 ) She is status
post MI as above. Her cardiac risk factors
are smoking and mild obesity.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has had a history of bilateral tubal
ligations.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: G 5 , P 4 , status post bilateral BTL. She has
had four normal spontaneous vaginal
deliveries.
MEDICATIONS: Iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d.; atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.; Axid 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a smoker. She does not drink
alcohol or use any other drugs. The patient&apos;s
primary care provider is Dr. Shane Orum
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL - The patient is a well-appearing
morning who speaks English as a secondary
language. Her primary language is Spanish. NECK - No thyromegaly ,
no lymphadenopathy. LUNGS - Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART - Regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs , gallop , or rubs.
BACK - No spinous tenderness , no CVA tenderness. ABDOMEN - Soft ,
non-tender. There is a lower abdominal mass midline approximately
10 weeks size. PELVIC - She has a normal external genitalia ,
normal vaginal with some blood in the vault. The cervix is widened
and on bimanual exam , there is a number of fibroids palpated in
this 8-10 weeks size uterus.
LABORATORY DATA: Hematocrit 40 on 11/8/97 , white count 7.0 ,
platelets 531. PAP in 10/20/97 was within normal
limits. An echo in 7/19 revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy
with good systolic function.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted thus for a TAH/BSO on
10/2/98 , which was performed without
complications and a minimal EBL of 150.
Postoperatively , in the PACU , she had several PVCs on the monitor
and electrolytes were checked , as well as CBC , and she was ruled
out for MI. Her potassium returned to 4.6 , mag 1.9 , and hematocrit
34. She was given 2 gm of magnesium sulfate and she was felt to be
stable. She ruled out for MI over the ensuing 24 hours with CKs of
70 , 117 , and 170. She had no symptoms of chest pain , jaw pain , or
left arm pain at any point during this admission.

ishemia:There was a low probabilty of ACS. The patient had negative
enzymes x 3. EKGs were unchanged from previous EKGs. He was discharged
on his home medicatino regimen. However , his nexium was increased to BID
to eliminate GI contribution to frequent chest pain episodes. Further
work-up was deferred due to recent extensive work-up including cath 7/13
The patient was discharged on all of his other home medications.
Endo-Patient was taken off oral diabetic regimen , but was restarted on
these medications on discharge. Of note , his novolin 70/30 is pre-filled
by an WCUOMC nurse and the exact dosing is not available in the chart.

Echocardiogram 9/25/07
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: seizures , hypoxemia
HPI: 53F h/o sarcoid , seizure disorder within the last year , possible
cardiomyopathy , asthma , smoking , HTN , and obesity p/w seizure activity
at home and then later in the ED. Has a history of intermittent
non-adherence to prescribed dilantin regimen. Treated acutely with
ativan , found to be subtherapeutic on dilantin so re-loaded with
dilantin to achieve therapeutic levels. Observed in ED overnight with
plans for morning discharge , but became questionably hypoxemic ( O2 sat
low 90s ) and somewhat subjectively dyspneic. The physicians in the
emergency room thought that the patient was having
an asthma exacerbation and gave the patient prednisone 60mg x 1 ,
combivent/albuterol nebulizer treatment , levofloxacin/clindamycin
for possible aspiration pneumonia , and admitted her to the medical floor
for further evaluation and treatment.
Hospital Course:
1 ) Pulmonary. On admission to the floor , the patient was found to have
normal oxygen saturations in the mid 90s on room air and was not thought to
have any concurrent bronchospasm or focal sounds of a pneumonia. Her chest
x ray was negative , she was not having fevers and her white blood count was
normal. Her steroids and levofloxacin/clindamycin were therefore
discontinued and she received her home inhalers and nebulizers only. She
remained stable on this regimen throughout her hospital stay. Her breath
sounds and heart sounds were admittedly a bit distant and she may have an
element of undiagnosed COPD , so pulmonary function tests were recommended
as an outpatient. Additionally , the patient may benefit from a sleep study
as an outpatient given her component of desaturation while asymptomatic and
sleeping during the night of admission.
2 ) Infectious disease. The patient did have an apparent urinary tract
infection and so was treated with ciprofloxacin 250mg twice daily for three
days.
3 ) Cardiovascular. The pt did report some symptoms of PND and orthopnea ,
which appeared to be stable for the last several years. She was not volume
overloaded on exam. She received an echocardiogram to investigate possible
cardiomyopathy or congestive failure , and this showed a normal ejection
fraction without obvious structural abnormalities except for mild bilateral
atrial dilatation.
4 ) Neurological. The inpatient medical team communicated with the pts
outpatient neurologist to discuss continued seizures in the context of
questionable intermittent noncompliance. Per the instructions of her
neurologist , the pts dilantin was increased to 230mg PO QAM and 200mg PO
QPM with plans to check another dilantin level on Friday March ( five
days after increasing dose ). Her neurontin dose was also increased to 600mg
three times daily.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Please draw dilantin level on Friday 4/3/07 and send results to
outpatient primary care physician and outpatient neurologist.
2 ) Please help pt with medication teaching , especially as regards
anti-epileptics ( dilantin , neurontin ) in order to improve outpt
compliance and reduce frequency of seizures.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) Please follow up dilantin level to be drawn by VNA on Friday 10/21/07.
2 ) Consider PFTs/sleep study as outpt.

Strength one bid.
ALLERGIES: Include Ansaid and aspirin , the patient reports
a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 99 , blood
pressure of 160/80 , heart rate was in the
90&apos;s , respiratory rate of 18. Her lungs were clear bilaterally.
The heart exam was regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or
gallops. Abdomen was diffusely tender to deep palpation , however ,
soft active bowel sounds , no rebound , no peritoneal findings. Well
healed midline incision , no drainage , no erythema. Extremities are
nontender without edema.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Included a sodium of 145 , a K of 4.5 , chloride
of 99 , bicarb of 31 , and BUN and creatinine of
9/0.7 and a glucose of 103 , white count of 10.9 , with platelet
count of 508 and a hematocrit of 41.6. Her UA showed 5 to 10 white
cells , 3 to 7 red cells and 1 + grams. KUB showed a large amount
of stool in the large bowel , no free air , a few air fluid levels ,
overall picture was not consistent with small bowel obstruction.
The patient was admitted with a question of gastroenteritis vs.
partial small bowel obstruction , which would be early. She was
admitted and kept NPO for bowel rash to receive the IV fluids. No
NG tube was placed. On hospital day one , the patient was
complaining of abdominal crampiness and feeling nauseated. She had
a small amount of emesis. She had spiked a temperature of 101.2.
This was felt to still either be consistent with the flu , or ileus.
A fever work up was then begun. She had blood cultures that were
sent , repeat KUB and a repeat CBC. By the afternoon , the patient
was feeling a little bit better.
Her CBC that was drawn early in the morning , had a white count of
10.38 , a hematocrit of 38.4 , and a platelet count of 422. She had
a normal amylase at 57 , normal lipase at 15 , normal LFT&apos;s with an
ALT of 18 , ASC of 20 , and LVH of 290 and alk. phos. of 81 and total
and direct bilirubin of .3 and .2. Her SMA 7 showed the sodium of
138 and a K of 4.3. Her BUN and creatinine of 8/.8 , bicarb of 28
and a glucose of 107. Her KUB and upright that was repeated still
showed a large amount of stool in the large bowel , few air fluid
levels but no change from the earlier exam.
On hospital day three , the patient&apos;s fever curve had improved. The
cultures that were previously sent were no growth so far and these
remained negative throughout the course of the hospitalization. She
was tolerating clears over the course of the morning. However ,
later on in the day , her pain returned , mainly in the right upper
quadrant , right lower quadrant. At this point , the decision was
made to check a CT scan. Of note , when the patient was admitted and
had a temperature spike , she was placed on stress post steroids
given her history of Prednisone. This was maintained throughout
her hospitalization.
Her CT scan showed that there was contrast seen through the small
bowel and colon to the rectum. There was a small section of small
bowel with wall thickening at the paraumbilical level with fluid
around it and no absence of small bowel obstruction. No edema in
the colon , with a small amount of free fluid around the liver and
the pericolic gutters. This raised concern although these findings
could be consistent with small bowl obstruction , to erase concern
about ischemia. However , the patient&apos;s exam had improved
remarkably by the morning of the 22 of June Her abdomen was soft , with
active bowel sounds and the patient was only mildly tender. Given
that the exam was not quite consistent with the CT readings , other
things were considered in the differential. Of note , the patient
had a couple of loose stools and stool cultures were sent. He does
have a history of salmonella in the past. These cultures were
negative and included SSYC and C. diff.
The concern was raised on the 24 of June that if this was not consistent
with ischemic bowel , that perhaps this was an exacerbation of her
vasculitis and could represent vasculitic changes in her SMA
circulation which had improved because the patient was placed on
stress post steroids. An angiogram was performed and the findings
were as followed: The aortoiliac artery and SMA were normal in
appearance. There was no evidence of microaneurysm , narrowing or
dilation. Because of these findings , it was felt that this was
not a picture consistent with vasculitis. She was switched from
her Hydrocortisone to her usual Prednisone dose of 10 mg. q d on
the 5 of August , the day prior to discharge.
The patient did well overnight , tolerated clears in the morning ,
and by lunch time , was able to eat a full diet. Of note , the
patient the night prior to discharge , had a complaint of some calf
pain which was transient in nature. However , although her exam was
unremarkable , lower extremity noninvasives were done and these were
negative. So the patient is being discharged home in good
condition. She is tolerating a regular diet.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include Insulin , Procardia XL 60 mg. q
d , Axid 150 mg. bid , Prednisone 10 mg.

Discharge Date: 9/30/2001
PROCEDURE: Left lower extremity revascularization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year old male with a
history of peripheral vascular disease
status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft on 4/19/01 for
left lower extremity rest pain. He presents with eleven days of
left lower extremity swelling. Over the prior eight days the
patient noticed pain and pinkish discoloration of the left foot.
The patient also noticed occasional left foot coldness which was
relieved with dependent positioning.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. Hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus. Aortic stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left femoral to peroneal bypass in July of
2001. Right femoral to peroneal bypass in
September of 1999. Right fifth toe amputation in September of 1999. Multiple
wrist surgeries , including a failed left wrist fusion.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: He is on outpatient medications of Lopressor 25 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glipizide 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. qhs ,
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , and p.r.n. Percocet.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/21/01 for presumed
failed left femoral to peroneal bypass graft.
The patient was preopped for revision of his bypass graft and , on
1/26/01 , the patient was taken to the operating room for a femoral
to posterior tibial bypass graft. The patient tolerated the
procedure well but immediately postoperatively the patient was
noted to have non-Dopplerable signals in his left foot. The
patient was brought back to the operating room at which time the
significant sized clot was found in the distal anastomosis of the
graft which was removed. Again , the patient was returned to the
recovery room and , in the ensuing hours , the patient again lost all
Dopplerable signals in his left foot. On postoperative day #1 the
patient returned one more time to the operating room for revision
of his left bypass graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and had strong Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
tibial pulse throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. The
patient was kept on perioperative Ancef antibiotics.
On postoperative day #0 the patient was found to be in respiratory
distress. Chest x-ray revealed flash pulmonary edema. Cardiology
consult was obtained at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 35 percent with moderate aortic stenosis and
regurgitation. The patient ruled in by enzymes for a myocardial
infarction. The patient was kept on beta blocker for goal heart
rate less than 75 and was started on Digoxin. Cardiology also
recommended the addition of an Ace inhibitor for further blood
pressure control. The patient remained stable. He remained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for the first three days
postoperatively at which time the patient was medically stable and
transferred to a surgical floor and monitored bed. Repeat
echocardiogram on postoperative day #4 and #3 was unchanged from
his prior echocardiogram , again , revealing an ejection fraction of
35 percent with global hypokinesis , severe aortic stenosis , and
moderate aortic regurgitation. Cardiology continued to follow the
patient throughout his hospital stay. They recommended the patient
return for cardiac catheterization following a short stay in acute
rehabilitation. Otherwise the patient progressed well. He did
develop a small amount of erythema in his left lower extremity
incision site. He was restarted on antibiotics and the erythema
slowly regressed over the ensuing three days. Otherwise the
patient&apos;s incisions to his right arm , left leg , and right leg all
were clean , dry , and intact with staples.
Physical therapy consult was obtained and the patient was able to
ambulate with the assistance of a walker. The patient continued to
progress well. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated and
voided without difficulty. On postoperative days #9 and #8 , the
patient was accepted to acute rehabilitation at which time he was
transferred. The patient is in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: LEVEL OF ACTIVITY: He should continue working with
physical therapy to increase his mobility. DIET: He
has no restrictons of diet. Please keep his left lower extremity
elevated when he is resting in bed or in chair. Please call
Abed General Hospital if he experiences fevers , chills , or
redness or discharge from the surgical site. FOLLOWUP: The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. Koss in the vascular clinic.
Please call Cing Medical Center vascular clinic to arrange
for an appointment. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: He is discharged on
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and

Discharge Date: 9/1/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old status
post a massive gastrointestinal bleed
in April of 2001 who was transferred to the Gosroa Health Services
Hospital for a TIPS procedure which failed. She proceeded to go to
surgery at that time for a splenorenal shunt. She was recently
discharged from the Tonla Liha Measemillr Hospital And Clinic on August ,
2002. During the hospitalization , she had a complicating course
with encephalopathy , but she was able to be controlled with
lactulose and discharged to rehabilitation. She at that time also
had complications with infections for which she completed a course
of antibiotics. At rehabilitation , she was doing fairly well , but
her ammonia had been high. The highest was 196 on March ,
2002. The patient has also had increased confusion , increased
abdominal girth. When the daughters went in to visit her today ,
she was completely disoriented , complaining of abdominal pain. The
daughters also report subjective fevers and chills. At the
rehabilitation , her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure
of 94/60 , temperature 99.2. Per the daughters , the diet had not
been followed at rehabilitation and she was eating hot dogs. She
was also given benzodiazepines for sleep , up to 60-75 mg q. day of
Oxazepam. Per report , she had increased confusion and more acutely
in the last two days. In the emergency room on arrival , her blood
pressure was in the 120s , 98% on room air , she was febrile. She
was given levofloxacin , Flagyl and ampicillin. A Gastrointestinal
consult was called.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C , grade 4
esophageal varices , encephalopathy , status
post a frontal craniotomy , status post a motor vehicle accident
with a subdural hematoma , peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
olanzapine unknown dose , Flagyl which she
had completed her course for Clostridium difficile , albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers , lactulose 120 mg q.6h. , Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d. , Serax 30 mg , Duragesic patch , Neomycin 2 grams q.i.d. ,
Oxazepam 30 mg q.h.s. and 15 mg q.8h. p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with one of her daughters. She
has a remarkable history of tobacco for 30 years ,
one pack per day , recently quit.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 101.1 , heart rate
99-120 , blood pressure 94-149/55-71 , oxygen
saturation 99% on room air. GENERAL: She was a well-nourished ,
well-developed lady who was confused and agitated. HEENT:
Remarkable for icteric sclera. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIOVASCULAR:
She had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal. Jugular
venous pressure was flat. ABDOMEN: Positive for bowel sounds ,
soft , but distended. She reports tenderness on palpation. RECTAL:
Guaiac-positive per emergency department. EXTREMITIES: Her right
lower extremity had erythema , painful to the touch , no warmth and
no cords. NEUROLOGICAL: Positive for asterixis. She was alert
and oriented to person , but not to time and confused about the
place. She was unable to carry on a conversation and unable to
keep attentive. Her strength was 5/5 and her sensation was intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory data was remarkable for a sodium of 130 ,
potassium 4.9 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 17 , BUN 9 ,
creatinine 0.8 and glucose 100. Her ALT was 16 , AST 72 , alkaline
phosphatase 118 , amylase 15 and lipase 33. Her ammonia level was
45 , albumin 3.2 , total bilirubin 2.4. Her hematocrit was 29.1.
Her INR was 1.4. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Abdominal CT scan
showed that she had no abscess , no obstruction , no acute abdominal
process.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission ,
it was a confusing picture for increased
abdominal girth , however the CT scan showed that she had very
little ascites and on examination , little tenderness. Therefore ,
she got a paracentesis which was negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and Flagyl
for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , continued on the
lactulose and her diuretics. However , the patient much improved
from the gastrointestinal standpoint and after resolution of her
infectious picture ( see below ) , the patient was doing incredibly
well with spironolactone and Lasix. She has not been able to
tolerate her beta blocker secondary to hypotension. During her
hospitalization , her hematocrit has been stable. A
gastrointestinal consult was obtained. I appreciate their input.
They recommend to follow up with the Transplant Team. She has an
appointment to see the Transplant Team on July , 2002. At this
time , it is recommended that she begin to get work-up for a liver
transplant. However , her hematocrit and her INR remained stable
throughout the hospitalization.
2 ) Infectious disease: The patient was negative for spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis , however on the second day of
hospitalization , she grew out 4/4 bottles with gram positive cocci
in pairs which speciated to be Streptococcus Group B. Therefore ,
the antibiotics were tailored and she was started on nafcillin
intravenously. The patient then had a PICC line placed and she
will continue treatment of two weeks with intravenous penicillin.
The patient has been doing very well with resolution of her
erythema. Infectious Disease Service consult was obtained. I
appreciate their input. They suggested two weeks of intravenous
penicillin.
3 ) Cardiovascular/hematology: Given the swelling of the leg , the
patient had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for
clot. Otherwise , she remained in normal sinus rhythm and no
symptoms of congestive heart failure.
4 ) Psychiatry: The patient was very confused , most likely
delirium. Psychiatry input was greatly appreciated. Another
reason for her confusion was the fact that she was getting much
benzodiazepines at her rehabilitation before. She was weaned off
her benzodiazepines and started on olanzapine and titrated up as
tolerated. Therefore , we highly recommend avoiding benzodiazepines
in this patient and continue with olanzapine which can take p.r.n.
as well as needed.
5 ) Vascular: Vascular Surgery followed this patient during her
hospitalization and deemed that her splenorenal shunt was working
well with no evidence of leak.
DISPOSITION: The patient is sent to rehabilitation for further
treatment and finishing of her antibiotic course. At
this point , she has requested a new primary care physician and this
will be myself. I will follow her with an appointment in July ,
which I have scheduled for her.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , olanzapine 5
mg p.o. q. PM and olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o.
q.8h. p.r.n. , Atrovent inhalers , Azmacort , spironolactone 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , penicillin 3 million units intravenously q.4h. for a
complete course of two weeks , Nico-Derm 14 mg a day topical ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. which is to be held if her systolic
blood pressure is less than 100 , lactulose 30 ml p.o. t.i.d. ,
Motrin p.r.n. for pain and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

CV likely given her history. Will call Cards
consult in a.m. Important to assess specific
etiology given need for coumadin for MVR versus fall
risk with the syncopal episodes.Orthostatics
negative. Cardiology consulted , and recommended an event monitor to
assess for specific rhythms while she is symptomatic. Over her hospital
course , she had one episode of near-syncope similar to her weekend
symptoms. There was no typical rhythm noted on telemetry at that time.
Cardiology recommended monitoring HR and BP and consider d/c&apos;ing
Lopressor if it is excessively low and correlating with symptoms.
Would follow up on event monitor to determine need for further
intervention.
Neuro: Head MR negative; ruled out intracranial
ischemia/bleed. Heme: INR 4.3 on admission and restarted after holding

Discharge Date: 10/15/2005
ATTENDING: BABILONIA , HARRISON LENARD HILARIO
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Graft versus host disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient in 1/25 developed right breast cancer , stage III.
Treatment included lumpectomy and chemotherapy. The patient had
persistent pancytopenia , which was evaluated in 10/4 with bone
marrow aspirate biopsy , which showed multiple cytogenetic
abnormalities with findings consistent with myelodysplastic
syndrome. In 8/14 , she had a nonmyeloblative peripheral blood
stem cell transplant for a match unrelated donor. In 10/18 , she
had lymphocyte infusion. On 5/8 , chimerism study showed 58%
donor origin. Repeat chimerism on 8/23/05 showed 100%
chimerism. The patient prior to admission for two weeks had
diarrhea , watery in nature. She denied sick contacts , had GI
biopsy in middle of 5/24 that showed focal colitis , without
signs of GVHD. The patient was given prescription for steroids
three days prior to admission , but did not complete or fill the
prescription , was admitted from the clinic with significant skin
rash that was consistent with graft versus host disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes breast cancer in 1/25 , myelodysplastic syndrome ,
hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. The patient had isolated
complicated migraine headache and has aortic valvular disease
with aortic insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:
She describes no allergies to medications.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is divorced with one son , denies alcohol or illicit drug
intake.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL FINDINGS:
On exam vital signs were stable. The patient had dry
maculopapular rash over the upper chest and face , also including
the upper extremities , abdomen , and upper thighs bilaterally ,
flat , slightly erythematous. HEENT exam was normal. She had dry
mucous membranes. Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
Cardiac exam: There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard
best in the aortic area. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There
is no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. She has
large external hemorrhoids. There is no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. Neurological exam is nonfocal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Oncology: The patient has a history of MDS , 11 months status
post nonmyeloablative transplant. The patient was very slow to
engraft and required donor lymphocyte infusion. Most recent
chimerism studies on 8/23/05 showed a 100% donor origin. The
patient had stage III skin GVH confirmed by biopsy on 6/15/05.
She had moderate improvement response to Solu-Medrol , which was
started on 8/5/05 ( switched to prednisone on 6/11/05 ) and
Elidel started on 5/22/05. There has been even more improvement
in the skin GVH since initiating rapamycin on 8/6
Gut GVH/diarrhea. GI biopsy done on 5/10/05 showed grade II
graft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade I graft
versus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes.
The patient had no significant decrease in the amount of stools
with Solu-Medrol , marginal response to rapamycin , now with some
improvement status post three doses of ONTAK. ONTAK was given on
6/17/05 , 9/6/05 , and 10/22/05 without adverse events. The
patient was premedicated with Pepcid , steroids , Benadryl , and
Tylenol. The only side effect is marked increase in left upper
extremity edema ( see cardiovascular section for more details ).
Solu-Medrol IV was started 2 mg/kg/day , started on 8/5/05 ,
changed to 2 mg/kg by mouth oral steroids on 6/13/05. Began
tapering with steroids at 100 mg b.i.d. on 11/18/05 , decreased to
80 mg on 8/20/05 , and down to 60 mg twice daily on 10/24/05.
Rapamycin was started on 10/10/05 , goal level between 3 and 12.
The patient has been therapeutic since initiating therapy. She
remains on GVH diet , coordinating with dietary and kitchen for
correct menu. She also has been on lactose-restricted diet that
has helped the stool volume as well.
2. Hematology: The patient with no active bleeding was
transfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than
20. She did have intermittent bright red blood and clots in
stool , most recently on 10/2/05 and 8/25/05. This was
attributed to have large hemorrhoids that were found on
colonoscopy. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout.
3. Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughout
her hospitalization , maintained on prophylactic medication of
Mepron and acyclovir. Cytomegalovirus viral load on 2/7/05 ,
8/5/05 , 5/10/05 , and 10/10/05 , all negative. CMV viral load
on 9/6/05 was pending at the time of this dictation. The
patient is to remain on acyclovir and Mepron once transferred.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable ,
did not get hypotensive throughout the admission.
5. Extremities: The patient had left upper extremity swelling ,
markedly worsened , starting on tacrolimus , as this is known to
cause capillary leak syndrome due to an ultrasound of the left
upper extremity on 11/28/05 , which is negative for DVT. Etiology
is likely due to lymphedema secondary to axillary resection when
the patient had breast cancer and capillary leak syndrome
associated with ONTAK. The patient had an echocardiogram to
assess the etiology of peripheral edema , which showed an ejection
fraction of 60% , mild aortic insufficiency , and aortic stenosis ,
borderline diastolic dysfunction , normal right heart , and minimal
pericardial effusion.
6. Pulmonary: The patient had one episode of dyspnea when
speaking on 11/16/05 , which resolved without further symptoms
throughout the admission. The patient had chest x-ray on
10/6/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without other
abnormalities.
7. Gastrointestinal: Mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely a
component of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouth
coat is helpful to her. She should continue this throughout.
8. Gut: The patient had persistent loose stools improved ( see
oncology section ). Clostridium difficile testing sent on
8/26/05 and 3/5/05 were negative. She had intermittent bright
red blood per rectum that was related to external hemorrhoids , as
stated above in GI section.
Colonoscopy on 5/10/05 revealed stage II GVHD on biopsy with no
gross visual evidence of bleed. As the fact now , the patient was
admitted on 7/16/05 with bright red blood. The colonoscopy was
notable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internal
hemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graft
versus host disease. This was on 3/5/05. Liver transaminitis
on 8/29/05 , likely due to ONTAK would be followed as an
outpatient. The patient also had transient LFT abnormalities
when first admitted and has since resolved since discontinuing
Bactrim. The bilirubin remained normal. The patient was
asymptomatic.
9. Rectum: The patient had Anusol as needed for hemorrhoids.
She was not a candidate for surgical intervention due to
immunosuppression and infection risk.
10. Renal: The patient repeated increasing creatinine to 1.3.
She maintained a level of 0.9 to 1.2 throughout the last few
weeks before discharge.
11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has marked
peripheral edema. Diureses worked well. The patient was up to
18 kg above admit weight and now she is only 3 kg up from the
admit weight on 10/24/05. She is on Lasix 40 mg twice daily by
mouth. This is likely secondary to combination to venous
insufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. In the setting of
ONTAK , she was given albumin and Lasix three times daily , which
is no longer needed now that she that would not be pursuing ONTAK
therapy until an outpatient attending decides , otherwise. She
should have a goal I/O negative to 1 to 1.5 liters a day.
Monitor hemodynamics closely if the patient has been noted to be
dehydrated. Encouraged ambulation and for elevation we were
using Ace bandage like wraps. The patient had electrolytes
monitored and repleaded as needed. Nutrition was following.
12. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s fingerstick blood sugars were 134
and 163 , improved since steroids taper initiated. She remained
on the sliding scale as needed , likely this is due to steroids.
13. Dermatology: The patient upon admission had significant
involvement of skin due to GVH greater than 80% body surface area
involved. It is improved significantly , as the exam revealed
less erythema , darkening rash , and decreased distribution. The
patient is on GVH medication , as stated in Oncology section. She
also came in with macerated areas under both breast and was
treated with miconazole powder and had improved by the day of
discharge.
14. Access: The patient had double lumen Hickman catheter ,
which is erythematous surrounding exit site. The cuff has been
exposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , not
tender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in.
SOCIAL DISPOSITION:
The patient accepted at Dwan Uoswe Chehamp Hospital Center We had family
meeting on 8/20/05 with all siblings and patient&apos;s son agreed on
once the patient is at home , need for increased support ,
medication compliance , Mitchel Hursey , social worker from Tinmasca Hospital is following Dr. Kringas
DISCHARGE CONDITION:

Discharge Date: 1/30/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT KNEE CHONDRAL DEFECT.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1. PATELLOFEMORAL MALTRACKING.
2. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
3. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wolcott is a 42-year-old
gentleman who underwent multiple
procedures on his right knee , who presents for right knee
autologous chondrocyte implantation for a right knee medial femoral
condyle defect. He also presents for an anteromedialization of the
tibial tubercle for patellofemoral maltracking.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is notable for
glomerulonephritis with chronic renal
insufficiency , for renal induced hypertension , for insomnia , for
asthma , and for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable for
gastric bypass surgery , as well as a
perianal abscess that was treated with IV antibiotics , left knee
autologous chondrocyte implantation in August of 1999 , and right
knee osteochondral mosaic plasty in the past in August of 1998.
MEDICATION ALLERGIES: None.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Atenolol 100 mg q.a.m. , verapamil
180 mg q.d. , Zaroxolyn 5 mg q.a.m. ,
doxepin 150 mg q.h.s. , Valium 10 mg b.i.d. , Percocet , Oxycontin 20
mg b.i.d. , and Lasix 2.5 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his family , he is engaged and works
for the Wood I Ee
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Exam of his right knee shows that his
incisions are well-healed. There is a mild
effusion. Neurologic exam was intact. He had tenderness over the
medial femoral condyle.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 3/5 For
details of the procedure he underwent , please see
the operative note. In brief , a chondral defect of his right knee
and patellofemoral maltracking were noted. He then subsequently
underwent a decompression of his patellofemoral joint via a 4%
Fulkerson procedure. He also underwent autologous chondrocyte
implantation to his right knee medial femoral condyle defects. He
tolerated this procedure well. Postoperatively his neurovascular
status of his limb remained intact. A drain was left in place , and
care was taken to evaluate for compartment syndrome. No
compartment syndrome did develop. He did receive Coumadin
anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. He received perioperative
antibiotics. It was noted that the lateral skin flap over his
anterior knee wound was erythematous and he was restarted on Keflex
after his IV antibiotics were discontinued. His postoperative
course was notable for a worsening and acute onset of renal failure
on top of his chronic renal insufficiency. He was evaluated very
closely and followed by the Renal Consult Service. His creatinine
did rise from a baseline of around 4 up to 6.7. At the time of
discharge , his creatinine had begun to fall and his renal status
had stabilized.
He was seen by Physical Therapy , and he was placed in a continuous
passive motion machine to maintain knee motion. He was ambulated
touch down weightbearing on his right leg. He was to undergo no
active extension of his right knee. He was ready for discharge on
10/28/01. Discharge condition stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Follow-up with Dr. Kurtis Capes
2. Coumadin anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis for an INR goal of
1.5 to 2.0.
3. A course of p.o. Keflex.
4. Home CPM.
5. Touch down weightbearing with crutches for his right leg.
6. Active assisted range of motion and flexion of his knee , no
active extension.
7. Follow-up with his primary nephrologist regarding his renal
insufficiency.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36-year-old woman with a
history of morbid obesity and diabetes
mellitus with recently diagnosed abdominal wall cellulitis status
post a three week stay at Tondenpe Wacla Tusfire Hospital . The patient left
AMA from Tal/whit Community Hospital the day of current admission and
after spending several hours at home called the ambulance after she
slipped and fell out of her chair and was unable to get up. She
denies loss of consciousness , she was found on the floor lying on
her back. She denies fever or chills. She does have abdominal
pain , denies nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , increased urinary
frequency or dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for
obesity and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION INCLUDE: Insulin , lisinopril , cephalexin ,
Lipitor , cimetidine , Paxil ,
metformin.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature of 96.2 , blood
pressure of 121/64 , pulse of
124 , respirations 18 , saturation of 97 percent on room air. In
general , she is obese , tachypneic , and uncooperative. HEENT ,
supple neck , no jaundice , moist oral mucosa. CV , tachycardic
without murmur. Lungs , CTA anteriorly. Abdomen , lower abdominal
wall with extensive areas of erythema and induration with an open
wound 5 x 7 cm , no pus or drainage , tender to palpation.
Extremities , bilateral swelling , warmth , and erythema with
tenderness. Neurologic , uncooperative for exam , grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: laboratories on admission are significant for a
white count of 10.57 , hematocrit of 32.7 ,
platelets of 437. Chem-7 showed a sodium of 135 , potassium of 4.3 ,
chloride of 108 , CO2 of 15 , BUN of 6 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of
92 , calcium is 7.5. ESR 75 , INR 1.5 , PT 17.3 , PTT 36.1. UA showed
3 to 5 white blood cells , 2 to 3 red blood cells , positive
leukocyte esterase , positive nitrates. EKG showed sinus
tachycardia with a Q-wave in aVF and questionable Q in V4 through
V5 , left axis deviation , a flat T-wave in V2 through V6 , inverted
T-wave in 3 , all unchanged from previous. Chest x-ray showed no
infiltrates. An abdominal CT done at SH on 1/10 showed stranding
and fluid and gas along the anterior aspect of the abdominal wall
without evidence of abscess. An echo done at GAH showed normal
left ventricular function without valvular disease , with an EF of
64 percent. A surgical pathology report at B showed cellulitis
with ulceration and fat necrosis. Blood cultures at MHC were never
positive. Lower extremity Doppler on admission negative for clots
above the knee. CT done at LH was negative for PE.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: ID: The patient was assessed by
general surgery in the emergency room
and plastic surgery followed the patient while in-house. It was
thought that the patient did not require any further surgical
debridement , she is status post two surgical debridements at NCH .
It was recommended that she undergo wet-to-dry dressing changes.
Originally upon admission to the Irvra Hospital she was given nafcillin ,
however , after coming up to the floor she was changed to a regimen
of vancomycin , Cefotan and Flagyl as per ID recommendation at HOM ,
this is the regimen the patient was receiving at OMH . Her blood
cultures , of note , were never positive. It was recommended by the
ID service that the patient does need an abdominal CT to rule out
an abscess given the stranding seen on prior CT at SH , however ,
the patient was too large for the CT table at the Oale Hospital , as well
as for an MRI table , it will have to be assessed as to whether the
patient may be transferred to another facility for abdominal
imaging to rule out abscess , until that time wet-to-dry dressings
will continue to the wound and antibiotics will be continued IV.
Endocrine: The patient was given a regimen of NPH 14 units b.i.d.
and an insulin sliding scale with excellent control of blood sugar.
FEN: The patient has severe protein calorie malnutrition , and a
nutrition consult was obtained and extensive conversations were
carried out concerning whether or not to institute TPN or tube
feeds in this patient. The patient originally refused tube feeds
and it was explained to her the risks and benefits of TPN , and a
PICC was placed to institute TPN. However , on 6/6 the patient
attempted to leave AMA and was declared incompetent to make medical
decisions , so while TPN was instituted to help support the patient
nutritionally , at some point a feeding tube including a permanent
PEG will have to be reconsidered , as this is the best way to feed
the patient. Her admission albumin was 1.5 , indicative of severe
protein calorie malnutrition , and her severe malnutrition was also
thought to be the contributing , if not causative , factor to the
patient&apos;s renal failure.
Renal: The patient&apos;s admission creatinine was 1.2 with an increase
to 1.9 overnight , and continued to rise to a level of 3 throughout
her admission. A renal consult was obtained. FENA was less than 1
percent , so renal felt that the patient&apos;s acute renal failure was
most likely prerenal secondary to the patient&apos;s severe protein
calorie malnutrition at third spacing , so it was thought that the
patient would benefit from transfusions of blood products and/or
albumin to help pull fluid intravascularly. There was some thought
that perhaps her renal failure could have been due AIN from
nafcillin , however , her urine eos were negative. The patient did
have polyuria from yeast but this was thought to be colonization
and not actual infection. The patient did continue to receive IV
fluids throughout this hospitalization , and her electrolytes were
monitored and repleted as necessary.
GI: The patient did have some diarrhea , a C. diff was sent and is
currently negative.
Psychiatry: There were severe behavior problems with the patient
at AMC resulting in the necessity of maintain an elaborate care
contract with the patient that details each behavior that was
expected of the patient. However , throughout her stay at GH ,
though she was thought to have a severely regressed personality
disorder , she was deemed competent to make medical decisions and
thus left AMA from that facility. Upon arrival to Wrangwake Medical Center , she did express suicidal ideations to her niece , so a
psychiatric consult was obtained. However , psychiatry felt like
her suicidal ideation was most likely indicative of a borderline
type personality disorder , so it was not thought that she was
actively suicidal and did not require a one to one sitter.
However , she did continue to have manipulative behavior and severe
medical noncompliance , refusing all care including basic hygienic
care as well as wound dressings , medications , and interviews with
care providers and other medically necessary interventions. The
patient refused multiple evaluations by psychiatry to evaluate for
competence as the patient often did not want to listen when
attempts to explain to her her medical problems and the
consequences concerning medical decisions were attempted. Finally
on October , the patient did try to leave AMA during the night ,
and on the morning of March another psychiatric evaluation was
performed and the patient was declared incompetent by psychiatry ,
and the decision was made to proceed with medically necessary care
despite the patient&apos;s unwillingness to comply , and we have begun
the pursuit of her guardianship for this patient. The patient&apos;s
sister has agreed to pursue the role as her guardian. Until that
time , the patient will be restrained physically or chemically as
necessary for medically necessary intervention. Psychiatry is
continuing to follow.

Discharge Date: 8/9/2006
ATTENDING: DUPES , FERNANDO B.
TEAM: S Terchu Fay
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The condition responsible for causing this
admission is pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: COPD , CAD , diabetes type
2 , hypertension , TIA , TVD , psoriasis.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old female
with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , COPD , diabetes type
2 who was admitted with dyspnea and tachycardia on the 10/28/06.
The patient reported a history of cough with productive sputum x3
days and chest pain pleuritic in nature. She denied any nausea ,
vomiting , any bowel or bladder symptoms. She denied headache ,
fatigue , anorexia. Per her family , the patient had a fever to
103 and some confusion while reportedly at home. In the
Emergency Department at Re Memorial Hospital , she was tachypneic to the 40s
sating upper 80s on room air and had a fingerstick glucose of 30.
An ABG was consistent with a respiratory acidosis , pH of 7.3 ,
pCO2 of 55 , pO2 of 63 , sating 89% on 2 L. An admission chest
x-ray demonstrated an opacity at the left base. An EKG showed
some left-sided strain unchanged from prior. She received
azithromycin and ceftriaxone in the Emergency Department as well
as vancomycin and was started on BiPAP and transferred to the
MICU. In the MICU , she was treated as a COPD flare with
steroids , antibiotics , and nebulizers , however , the patient began
to tire and developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure
so was intubated on the night of the admission and extubated five
days later. Over the course of her MICU admission , she developed
AFib and had a troponin leak. Otherwise , the stay was
unremarkable and she extubated without complication and
transferred to the GMS Services on 4/8/06.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
Monday , Wednesday and Friday. The renal failure is secondary to
renal artery stenosis. Hemodialysis began in April 2005.
Diabetes type 2 with hemoglobin A1c of 5.8. COPD , no PFTs are
available. Hypertension. Coronary artery disease with history
of remote MI , diastolic dysfunction/CHF. TIA for which she
receives Coumadin. Bilateral fem-pop bypasses , psoriasis and a
perforated appendix.

Combivent doses unknown.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS TO THE GMS SERVICE: Diltiazem 90 p.o.
q.i.d. , Lopressor 37.5 q.i.d. , aspirin , albuterol , PhosLo ,
Colace , Pepcid , insulin NPH 15 units b.i.d. , Nicotine patch ,
nystatin , prednisone taper , betamethasone , captopril 50 t.i.d. ,
Coumadin 2 , simvastatin 20 , an Aspart sliding scale and p.r.n.
lactulose , Zyprexa and Ativan.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is an active smoker , smokes about a pack and
a half a day for the past 55 years. Lives with her daughter , has
9 children.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON TRANSFER TO THE GMS SERVICE: Weight 92.9 ,
temperature is 96.2 , heart rate 118 AFib , BP 107/57 , sating 95%
on 2 L. In general , she appeared younger than stated age. She
had a psoriatic rash on her right thigh. Neuro exam , she was
hard of hearing , otherwise her cranial nerves were intact and she
was alert and oriented x3. Head and neck exam notable for JVP of
5 cm of water. Mucous membranes were moist. Her oropharynx was
clear. Her extraocular motions were full. Her cardiac exam , she
had a regular rhythm without appreciable murmurs , rubs or
gallops , no heaves. Lungs , she had expiratory wheezing without
rhonchi or crackles. Abdomen , although distended but soft , no
laparotomy scar , normoactive bowel sounds without guarding. She
had a Port-A-Cath in her right chest that appeared clean , dry and
intact. Extremities , she had TEDs and SCDs , bilateral pedal
edema , they were warm.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. From a Pulmonary Standpoint: Pneumonia/COPD flare. The patient was
admitted with pneumonia and COPD flare for which she needed to be intubated and
had a short MICU stay. She did well on antibiotics and was
changed from ceftriaxone , azithromycin , and vancomycin to
levofloxacin which she completed a ten-day course. She also
started on steroid taper and will leave with 20 mg of prednisone
for two more days and then 10 mg of prednisone for three days.
Upon transfer to the floor , she was restarted on Combivent and
Flovent and received p.r.n. albuterol nebulizers and albuterol
inhaler on a q.4 basis. Smoking cessation was emphasized with
the patient. Ace consult was called and the nicotine patch was
continued. She was given a flu vaccine while in the hospital.
The blood cultures and sputum cultures were unrevealing and her
O2 saturation was titrated to greater than 93%.
2. From an endocrine perspective she had a history of diabetes
type 2. She was fleetingly placed on Portland protocol while in
MICU and then transferred to NPH 15 b.i.d. insulin and NovoLog
sliding scale. She should continue her aspirin and ACE inhibitor
as an outpatient and later her hemoglobin A1c was consistent with
very well controlled diabetic.
3. From a cardiovascular standpoint:
A. Ischemia. Her troponin peaked to 0.38 on 11/22/06 while in
the MICU. It was not associated with any dynamic EKG changes ,
however , her EKG does show some evidence of strain versus
infralateral ischemia with T-waves inversions in the inferior and
lateral leads. Her troponin trended down over the course of the
admission and on last check were less than 0.2. There was a
question of whether this leak was due to volume overload versus
infection. Her aspirin , statin , beta-blocker , and ACE were
continued. Her fasting lipid profile was remarkable only for
hypertriglyceridemia and HDL of 38. She is scheduled for a
outpatient nuclear medicine stress test on 8/13/06 at 09:00 a.m.
B. Rate. She was noted to be in AFib on the MICU and rate was
controlled with diltiazem and Lopressor titrated to heart rate of
80 , she was monitored on tele over the course of admission. She
was already in Coumadin for TIAs , however , the new INR goal for
her is between 2 and 3 and Coumadin levels should be checked at
the time of dialysis.
C. Pump. Her EF was 55% on echo that was done while in the
MICU. There is some evidence of aortic sclerosis , otherwise ,
there is no hypokinesis or wall motion abnormalities noted.
4. From a hematologic standpoint , she was started on epopoietin
for anemia of chronic disease. Her baseline hematocrit of 35
dropped to 26 while in the MICU and she received a unit of blood
for that. Following that transfusion , her hematocrit was stable
in the lower to mid 30s. She was also restarted on iron , which
she takes as an outpatient. Her stool is guaiac negative over
the course of the admission.
5. From a GI perspective , the patient had a mild transaminitis
noted while in the MICU thought likely secondary to hepatic
congestion. Viral serologies were drawn including hep B and C ,
which were negative. Her transaminitis resolved on its own.
6. From a dermatologic perspective , the patient has a history of
psoriasis. She was continued on topical steroids with good
effect.
7. From an infectious disease standpoint , this patient has
evidence of pneumonia by clinical exam and chest x-ray on
admisison , which appeared to be resolved. She completed a
ten-day course of levofloxacin. In addition , multiple cultures
were taken while in the MICU including that from the A line which
grew out coag-negative staph thought likely to be a contaminate.
8. Neuro exam , she was alert and oriented and intact upon
transfer to the medical service. For history of TIAs her
Coumadin was continued.
9. FEN. The patient was started on a renal diabetic low-fat
diet and was fluid restricted to 2 L a day.
10. Renal. The patient is on dialysis Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday for end-stage renal disease secondary to RAS. She is
followed by renal and had a renal attending during the course of
this hospitalization. She was started on Neutra-Phos ,
Nephrocaps , and her PhosLo was continued. Her calcium and
phosphorus were monitored q.a.m. and her IPTH was checked and was
415.
11. Prophylaxis. Heparin was continued subcu until her INR was
therapeutic. She still is on VRE precautions for a positive
rectal swab.
She was a full code.
Discharge medications will be included as an addendum.

troponin to 1.69 which rose to a max of 2.41 with no ekg changes. She was
rate controlled and started on Levofloxacin. Her mental status improved
and fever resolved. She remained tachycardic and nodal block was
supressing blood pressure. She was started on digoxin with excellent
response. HR stayed in 70-80&apos;s and up to 100&apos;s with exersion. Her cardiac
workup included an echocardiogram with RV dialation and wall akinesis
with apical sparing , a new finding since last echo in &apos;03. Right sided
EKG neg. A PE was then ruled out with PE protocol CT. The following day
the patient had a adenosine MIBI that showed no perfusion defects. Her
INR was increasing due to the levofloxacin effect and was switched to
ceftriaxone consistant with blood culture succeptabilities. Follow up
blood cultures on 3/11 then demostrated gram positive cocci in clusters
and the patient was given 2 doses of vancomycin to cover potential staph
infection. Cultures were found to be skin flora and patient asymptomatic
and antibiotics d/c&apos;d. Repeat cultures were negative. Patient was
discharged in good condition and will return to PCP for close follow up.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Call PCP with any changes in urinary symptoms , or fever &gt;101.0. Return to
ER if any changes in mental status , chest pain , SOB , or syncope. Complete
the full course of antibiotics which cover the next 8days. F/U with PCP
within the next week with INR and digoxin levels. Do not use lasix unless
necessary and contact PCP if using more than 1-2 times per week due to
possible toxicity with digoxin use.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
VNA instructions: Please do vital signs checks. Patient needs a digoxin
level and INR checked weekly , and the first set of labs should be drawn
1-2 days after discharge. PCP will follow-up labs. Guiac + x 1 needs f/u.
TO THE PATIENT: We have altered cardiac medications for better rate
control. We have cancelled the coreg( carvedelol ) and
Norvasc( amilodipine ) and replaced them with a blood pressure medication ,
Toprol XL( Metoprolol XL ) to better control the rate of your atrial
fibrillation. The digoxin was also added for heart rate control.

Discharge Date: 2/15/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mcguirl is a 44 year old man with a
history of hypertension and a family
history of coronary artery disease who presents with new onset of
chest pain. He has been previously treated at the PH for
hypertension. He has no cardiac history , no prior history of chest
pain. He ran out of his blood pressure medicines approximately one
week prior to presentation. He was feeling well until the day of
admission while at work when he noted onset of substernal chest
pain while seated. He was diaphoretic , nauseated , but had no
vomiting. He also had some shortness of breath but no
palpitations. He went to SH with the same pain and an
electrocardiogram showed LVH with strain. He was given oxygen and
sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. He was sent to the
Rahoag Hospital emergency room. There , he was treated
with Magnesium Sulfate , IV Lopressor , IV Nitroglycerin , and
sublingual Nifedipine. His blood pressure at WMC had been 210/150.
His pain then resolved with a total of approximately five hours.
He was entirely pain-free since his treatment in the emergency
room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for only hypertension. He
was on three medications which he is unsure of , including
Captopril. He apparently had good blood pressure control with his
blood pressure medication. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril of unknown dose; Hydrochloro-
thiazide 15 mg po q day; Diltiazem of unknown dose. FAMILY
HISTORY: Significant for his father who died of myocardial
infarction at age 50. SOCIAL HISTORY: He works as a plumber at
Hunt Ca He does not drink and does not smoke.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a middle-aged , black man , in no
apparent distress. His blood pressure was
140/100 , pulse 76 , afebrile. Head and neck exam showed PERRL ,
oropharynx was benign. Neck was supple and no adenopathy. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. His cardiovascular exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , an S4 gallop. No
murmurs or rubs , no jugular venous distention , and his carotids
were 2+ bilaterally. Abdomen; good bowel sounds , no hepato-
splenomegaly , no masses. Extremities; no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. Neurologic exam was non-focal.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: potassium 4.9 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.1 ,
glucose 134 , hematocrit 44.6 , white count of
11 , and platelets of 223. CK was 215. PT was 12.1 , PTT 30.1. His
electrocardiogram showed him to be in normal sinus rhythm at 83
beats per minute , normal intervals , axis was -29. He did have LVH
with strain. His chest x-ray showed no pulmonary vascular
redistribution , no effusions or infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit
and ruled in for a myocardial infarction. His
peak CK was 453 with MB fraction of 16.5. He was in the coronary
care unit for one day , after which he was transferred to the floor.
He had no arrhythmias or complications of his myocardial
infarction. Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate
concentric LVH with moderate chamber enlargement , posterolateral
hypokinesis , and ejection fraction of 45% , and moderate mitral
regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets. His
hypertension was initially controlled with Lopressor 150 mg three
times a day. He was then changed to Atenolol and Captopril. With
these medications , he had good blood pressure control. One week
after his myocardial infarction , he underwent an exercise tolerance
test MIBI. He went for 9 minutes on his exercise tolerance test
and stopped due to completion of his protocol. He had no chest
pain or shortness of breath and no ischemic changes on his EKG , and
reached a peak blood pressure of 180/85 and a peak pulse of 94.
His MIBI images showed a fixed defect in the apical anterior
lateral wall , but no reversible changes , consistent with myocardial
infarction but no ischemia. He is discharged to home in stable
condition.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg po q day , aspirin
325 mg po q day , Lisinopril 10 mg po q day ,
sublingual Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual x3 q 5 minutes

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
78 yo man who presents with 2 episodes of SSCP. Recently had MV and TV
repair with SVG to OM1. Reported to have 80% diag , 70% LCX from a cath
in Ohio in 3/1 Also h/o HTN , DM 2 ( diet controlled ) , AF ,
ventricular pacemaker , ischemic CMP , EF 30%. CP occurred while at
rest , no radiation and no associated symptoms. 1st episode was 10/8 ,
resolved spontaneously. Came to ED , EKG was paced , CK flat , TnI
elevated at 0.17 , similar to value on 4/21 when pt came in for a TIA.
Mr. Faiella was sent home with sl nitro. Pain occurred again while
watching TV , resolved with one sl nitro. Was admitted for workup of
possible ischemia. Currently CP free.
1. CV: Ischemia: ruled out for MI , added isordil to regimen , ASA.
Continue carvedilol , captopril. Likely to have CAD , Adenosine MIBI
revealed fixed inf/lat defect , consistent with LCX disease. No
reversible defects. Since chest pain is unlikely to be cardiac in
origin , will stop nitrates. Pt was able to amubulate w/o SOB or CP
CHF: euvolemic. continue lasix , aldactone , digoxin.
2. Endo: DM 2 , diet controlled. HbA1C 5.8%
3. Renal: baseline Cr 2.0
4. Neuro: recent history of TIA , on coumadin , may not want to reverse
anticoagulation for possibility of cath.
5. Heme: coumadin was held for possible cath , but was restarted on day
of discharge.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain , and we have made sure
that you are not and did not have a heart attack. We also did a

Discharge Date: 10/17/2006
ATTENDING: POLEY , DAVIS RAYFORD HENRY
DATE OF ADMISSION: 1/1/2006.
DATE OF DISCHARGE: 10/7/2006.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old female with a
history of hypertension and blindness who presents with three
days of acute abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She
presented in this manner to her ECMHMC Clinic on the date of
admission , and was sent immediately for an abdominal CT , which
was noted to have findings consistent with pancreatitis. At that
time , she was transferred to the Dama Medical Center
emergency department. The patient reports that the pain began in
her upper abdomen three days prior to admission with radiation
throughout the entire abdomen. She was eating soup when she
first noted the acute onset of this pain and then had an episode
of emesis. Since then , she has not been feeling well , and not
been eating much , but did not have any further episodes of
emesis. She did have chills overnight , but no sweats or no
fevers and no diarrhea. Her last bowel movement was three days
prior to admission. The pain was more cramping and burning than
sharp pain. She had never had prior episode like this. She is a
rare drinker , mostly on holidays. Has not had any recent viral
illnesses , although did have a recent flu shot. Did not have any
sick contact. In the Mano Community Hospital emergency
department , she received 1 liter of normal saline through her IV ,
2 mg of morphine IV , and potassium replacement.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She also endorsed a small amount of an
intentional weight loss and denied any chest pain , shortness of
breath , cough , or symptoms suggestive of fluid overload.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Legal blindness , likely secondary to macular degeneration.
3. Obesity.
4. Osteoarthritis.
5. Status post total hip replacement.
6. Peripheral neuropathy.
7. Status post TAHBSO for fibroids.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily.
2. Premarin 0.9 mg p.o. daily.
3. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily.
ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes angioedema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone and is retired , but
previously worked for an epilepsy foundation. She has never
smoked tobacco. Does occasionally drink alcohol and has never
used any illicit drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: She does have a sister with a history of a
dropped foot , but does not have any family history of diabetes ,
coronary artery disease , cancer , or pancreatitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The temperature was 100.3 ,
heart rate 95-110 , blood pressure 124-151/60-77 , respiratory rate
of 18 , oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. In general , she was
comfortable and in no acute distress. HEENT , she has chronic
injection on the left conjunctiva , but her oropharynx was clear.
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive , and extraocular movements
were intact. Her neck showed no thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy ,
and her JVP was flat. Chest with slight bibasilar crackles.
Heart with a regular rate and rhythm , and a 2/6 systolic murmur
at the right upper sternal border without radiation. Abdomen was
soft with decreased bowel sounds throughout and diffuse moderate
tenderness to palpation without rebound , guarding , or Murphy.
Extremities showed trace bilateral pitting edema to the mid shin
that were warm and well perfused with 2+ pulses. Skin showed no
rashes. Neuro exam was alert and oriented x3 and was grossly
nonfocal.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Significant for chem-7 with
potassium of 2.7 , bicarbonate of 29 with a normal creatinine of
0.7. CBC showed a white blood cell count of 11.7 with 74%
neutrophils , hematocrit of 36.2 , increased from a baseline of 32 ,
platelets of 326 , and MCV was 85. LFTs were slightly elevated
with an AST of 69 , ALT of 92 , alkaline phosphatase of 148 , a
total bilirubin of 1.1. Amylase was 133 , lipase was 86 , albumin
was 3.7 , and a urinalysis showed 2+ ketones , a specific gravity
of 1.112 , no white blood cells , and 2+ squamous epithelial cells.
IMAGING: An EKG showed no change from her prior diffuse T-wave
flattening and T-wave inversion with normal sinus rhythm at 96
beats per minute. Chest x-ray showed tiny bilateral pleural
effusion and a slightly globular heart that was otherwise normal.
An abdominal CT was consistent with pancreatitis with
peripancreatic stranding , and there was stones seen in the
gallbladder; however , there was no common bile duct dilatation
and no pseudocyst or evidence of necrosis in the pancreas.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension who presented with acute abdominal pain and an
abdominal CT consistent with pancreatitis with gallstones in the
gallbladder , but without evidence of obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. GI: Pancreatitis diagnosed by clinical picture. Laboratory
values on CT findings on admission with no evidence of pseudocyst
or necrosis or other surgical complications of pancreatitis.
Though likely etiology for pancreatitis was gallstone given that
there were gallstones seen on her abdominal CT and that she had
elevation of some of her LFTs. She did go on to have a right
upper quadrant ultrasound to reevaluate. The common bile duct
looked not dilated , but right at the upper limits of normal.
Given this borderline values she was also sent for MRCP to rule
out CBD dilatation in the event that she may need cholecystectomy
in the future. The MRCP showed again no evidence of obstruction
of the duct and no evidence of cholecystitis. She was treated
with aggressive IV fluid hydration for the first several days of
admission. Pain controlled with morphine , and was kept n.p.o.
for several days until her pain improved. At this time , her IV
fluids were gradually decreased , and her diet was gradually
advanced as tolerated. By the time of discharge , she was
tolerating a regular diet without any recurrence of her abdominal
pain , nausea , or vomiting , and was not requiring any further pain
medication. Her LFTs , amylase , and lipase normalized within a
few days of treatment early in the hospitalization. She was also
maintained on IV b.i.d. H2 blocker , and then discharged to home
on p.o. Pepcid. Given her stated history of heartburn. She was
given an appointment to follow up with the TH General Surgery
Clinic for evaluation for likely cholecystectomy and instructed
that this would be her plan of care after discharge.
2. Cardiovascular. In terms of ischemia , the patient did have
some T-wave flattening diffusely on her EKG; however , had no
chest pain. This is likely related to her hypokalemia on
presentation. She did rule out for an MI with 3 sets of negative
enzymes and had no EKG changes or telemetry changes concerning
for ischemia and no bouts of chest pain throughout her admission.
In terms of pump , she was aggressively fluid rehydrated , given
her dehydration on admission , and her diagnosis of pancreatitis ,
but did not have any signs of fluid overload at any point during
her hospitalization , and was returned to all p.o. diet without
need for IV fluids prior to discharge. Her blood pressure was
well controlled originally with her home medication of Norvasc
and then with a change to Lopressor in order to obtain good rate
control as well without bouts of hypertension throughout this
admission. In terms of rhythm , the patient did have some
episodes of likely atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial
tachycardia on telemetry early in her admission. These episodes
would last only a few seconds and resolved spontaneously and the
patient did not have symptoms from these. This was thought to be
likely related to her acute illness and her hypokalemia on
admission. However , she was started on Lopressor for better rate
control , which was up titrated as needed with good effect. By
the time of discharge , she had had no events on telemetry for
greater than 36 hours. She was discharged on new medication of
Toprol to control her rate and also taking the place of her
Norvasc for her blood pressure control.
3. ID. The patient did have a low-grade temperature on
admission , but this was likely related to her inflammation.
Blood cultures x2 drawn at the time of admission were negative.
The chest x-ray was negative for any growth and finalized before
discharge. Chest x-ray was negative for any evidence of
pneumonia and a urinalysis was negative. She was not started on
any antibiotics throughout the admission.
4. Hematology. The patient has underlying anemia with an
unclear baseline hematocrit given her infrequent labs at this
institution. Her hematocrit was stable between 31 and 36
throughout her hospitalization here and recommended that she
follows up with her primary care provider for further
instructions on her anemia.
5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition. The patient was initially
aggressively fluid rehydrated and then changed to maintenance IV
fluids. Thus , her diet was advanced. Potassium and magnesium
were repeated as needed with electrolytes originally checked
twice per day until stabilized. She was originally maintained
n.p.o. and then her diet was gradually advanced as her symptoms
tolerated to a house diet before discharge.
6. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on IV b.i.d. , Pepcid
for GI prophylaxis , and Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
7. Code status. The patient is DNR/DNI.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient is discharged to home with a
visiting nurse to check in on her for medication management ,
nutrition , and home safety evaluation. She has followup
appointments with her primary care provider , Dr. Gahring , and
also with the FNH General Surgery Clinic regarding possible
cholecystectomy. She was instructed not to take her Norvasc any
more and to take instead the Toprol. Also , she was instructed to
call her physician for any new bouts of abdominal pain , fevers ,
or any other worrisome symptoms.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol-XL 100 mg per day.
2. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily.
4. Premarin 0.9 mg p.o. daily ( however , it is recommended that
her PCP consider weaning off this medication given its known
risks and recent evidence-based literature , and also given the
possible risk of gallstones of this medication ).

POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ANGINA.
LAD CLOT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old white
male who has no known cardiac risk
factors. On 6/15/91 , he had one hour of substernal chest pressure
which resolved spontaneously while at work. The next day while
taking a nap , he awakened from sleep with heavy dull substernal
pain with some pleuritic quality , maximum pain was 7-8/10 with
diaphoresis but no shortness of breath. He went to Tionstrict Skiller Ronuscbres Medical Center , the pain subsided shortly after arrival after
sublingual nitroglycerin , oxygen and morphine. The total duration
of the pain was approximately two hours. EKG showed 2 mm ST
elevations in I and AVL. He was not given PTA because of his past
history of hematuria. He was taken to the Coronary Care Unit on IV
heparin , TNG and diltiazem. He ruled in with peak CK of 441 with
18% MB&apos;s. His EKG&apos;s have shown ST returning to baseline and T wave
inversions in I , L , V2-V6. On 5/13 , he had recurrent 1/10 chest
pain. On 10/8 , he had recurrent 7/10 chest pain for 90 minutes. He
was transferred to Spilub Valley Hospital shortly after the
chest pain resolved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hematuria with
multiple cystoscopies and IVP procedures negative. MEDICATIONS: On
transfer included nitroglycerin , diltiazem and propanolol. HABITS:
The patient does not smoke or drink. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
Right and left cardiac catheterization with stent x2 to vein graft
OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )
None
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76yoM with CAD s/p CABG 1997 presented with 2-3 weeks of nocturnal
angina with increased nitroglycerin requirement for relief. Given
limitations of imaging modalities due to his severe spinal stenosis ,
MIBI/ETT were not feasible , so the patient presented for elective
catheterization 5/16/06. Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted in
the PLV: a 90% occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque.
Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding
stents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%
occlusion. During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of
40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the
possibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell &apos;s severe lower back pain
and limited ability to ambulate. The catheterization was without
complications. The patient was placed on Plavix x 6 weeks and Aspirin
indefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimen
of Captopril , Metoprolol , Isordil , Digoxin , Spironalactone , Insulin ,
Lasix , Zocor and prn Nitroglycerin. Groin sheaths were removed and the
patient was without hematoma or bruit. He had 2 episodes of chest
pressure several hours following the procedure with negative EKG and
stable vitals; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur.
On discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortness
of breath.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your Aspirin and Plavix. The Aspirin needs to be taken every
day on a long term basis , and the Plavix must be taken for ATLEAST 6
WEEKS from 10/29
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please follow up with your Cardiologist , Dr. Golaszewski
Please take your Plavix 75mg for 6 weeks ( until atleast 3/12/06 )
Take your Aspirin 325mg indefinately
Please reschedule appointment with Dr. Kuick to receive steroid
injections for spinal stenosis until AFTER your course of Plavix is
complete

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: HOGGE , WILLIAMS DAREN MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Elective right total knee replacement.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including asthma , interstitial
lung disease and autoimmune hepatitis leading to cirrhosis with
varices , hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia. Prior to admission
she lived with her husband and was independent with activities of
daily living. She was limited by right knee pain. She was
admitted to Roundcleod Valley Medical Center 9/2/05 for elective
right total knee replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Migraine headaches , interstitial lung
disease , asthma , reflux , hepatitis A , autoimmune hepatitis
leading to cirrhosis with varices , hypersplenism , and
thrombocytopenia , coagulopathy , chronic diarrhea x10 years ,
status post cholecystectomy , osteoporosis , L4 compression
fracture , osteoarthritis.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Valium.
2. Advair.
3. Combivent.
4. Prednisone
5. Nexium.
6. Propranolol.
7. Lasix.
8. Spironolactone.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink
alcohol. She is married with four children.
ADMISSION LABS: Potassium 4.3 , white blood cell count 9.9 ,
hematocrit 26.3 , platelets 61 , INR 1.3.
ADMISSION EXAM: First documented by the orthopedic team: Alert
and oriented , afebrile. Pulse in the 70s and sinus. Blood
pressure in the 90s/50s. Satting 100% on 2 liters. Thin ,
elderly woman , faint bibasilar crackles. Regular rate and
rhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Extremities: Warm.
ADMISSION IMAGING: Portable chest x-ray on 10/11/05 with patchy
opacity in the left lung base , likely atelectasis.
ADMISSION EKG: Normal sinus rhythm , normal axis. QTC 464. LVH ,
T-wave inversion in 3 , T-wave flattening in AVF , T-wave
flattening in V3 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Ortho: Right knee replacement. The patient underwent an
uncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. Subsequently
her leg was immobilized as per orthopedic recommendations. The
reason for immobilization was that movement of the right lower
extremity might precipitate skin tears.
2. Skin: The patient incurred a laceration in her left calf
perioperatively. She also incurred a skin tear on 11/29/05 with
turning in the bed. Her skin was noted to be paper thin with
underlying fluid. Wound healing was impaired secondary to low
albumin and chronic steroid use. The patient was seen by the
Plastic Surgery team. This team recommended appropriate
dressings for the patient&apos;s skin tears. The team also grafted
the left thigh skin tear. The patient was treated with
supplemental vitamins to promote wound healing including vitamin
A and zinc. She was also treated with antibiotics to prevent
skin infections. Originally she had been on vancomycin for a
urinary tract infection and when the course was complete for the
urinary tract infection , the patient was switched to Keflex for
prophylaxis versus skin infections.
3. GI: End stage liver disease with varices and
thrombocytopenia. The patient&apos;s complete metabolic panel and
coags were checked each day. During the course of her
hospitalization , the patient&apos;s transaminases were relatively
stable , but her alkaline phosphatase trended upward. On exam ,
the patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness which she
reported was chronic. On 5/13/05 , the patient underwent an
abdominal ultrasound to evaluate her right upper quadrant
tenderness and elevated alk/phos. This study revealed a 2.0 x
1.6 x 1.6 cm hyperechoic mass in the portahepatis. This study
also showed evidence of cirrhosis as well as common bile duct
dilation and splenomegaly. A CT scan to further evaluate the
portahepatic mass was recommended. For her autoimmune hepatitis ,
the patient was continued on prednisone. For her varices , she
was continued on propranolol. Her Lasix and spironolactone were
held through much of her hospitalization. On 6/19/05 , her Lasix
was restarted in an attempt to remedy her hyponatremia.
4. Low albumin state: The patient has a low prealbumin
suggestive of decreased PO intake versus decreased synthetic
function of the liver. The patient also has chronic diarrhea and
was thought to be wasting protein. The patient refused ??___??
placement for tube feeds. She was initially on a house diet with
Ensure and Boost supplements as well as MVI and lactinex
granules. The patient was not taking in adequate calories. On
6/19/05 , TPN was initiated.
5. Persistent chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history of
chronic diarrhea. Stool studies including C. diff testing was
negative. The patient was also tested for celiac sprue and this
testing , too , came back negative. The patient was treated
symptomatically with Imodium.
6. GERD: This patient was treated with Nexium and p.r.n.
Maalox.
7. Dysphagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was
evaluated by the Speech and Swallow team on 4/6/05. Her
swallowing function was noted to be intact.
8. Infectious Disease:
Postoperative prophylaxis: Immediately postoperatively , the
patient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxis
versus perioperative infection.
Skin Prophylaxis: The patient was initially treated with
vancomycin and switched to Keflex.
Urinary tract infection: The patient had a series of dirty UA&apos;s.
She was ultimately treated with vancomycin for a urine culture
that grew out resistant staph species. She finished her course
of vancomycin on 8/7/05. A repeat UA was noted to be positive
for infection. A repeat urine culture is pending.
Odynophagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was
treated empirically with fluconazole and clotrimazole for
esophageal Candida. This treatment did not remedy her pain in
swallowing. The patient then developed mouth sores. HSV swabs
of these sores are pending. The patient was treated
symptomatically with viscous lidocaine.
9. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of interstitial lung
disease and asthma. She was treated with Combivent and standing
nebulizer treatments. On 8/6/05 , the patient was noted to have
a new oxygen requirement of 3 to 4 liters. Differential
diagnosis was PE versus pneumonia versus volume overload. On
8/6/05 , the patient had a chest x-ray which showed left lower
lobe atelectasis. A repeat chest x-ray on 10/17/05 was read as
normal. On 7/15/05 , the patient was weaned down to room air.
10. Neuro:
Pain: The patient was treated with standing codeine sulfate.
Nausea: The patient was treated with p.r.n. Compazine.
11. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient has no known heart failure. In terms of her
volume status , she was deemed to be intravascularly depleted as
evidenced by prerenal urine electrolytes. She was thought ,
however , to be total body volume overloaded. It was thought that
in the setting of her low albumin , she was third-spacing fluid.
The patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and
spa. On 6/19/05 , normal saline was held and the patient was
treated with spa in conjunction with Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient had normal sinus rhythm. She was monitored
on telemetry.
Ischemia: The patient has no known history of coronary artery
disease. She had no chest pain. Her cardiac markers were
negative. Her EKG had nonspecific abnormalities. She was
continued on her beta-blocker. She was not on an aspirin given
her thrombocytopenia.
12. Renal: Decreased urine output. From the day of admission
onward , the patient had relative oliguria , 500 to 900 cc of urine
per day approximately. Her creatinine trended downward from a
value of 0.5 on admission down to as low as 0.2. As noted above ,
the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spa
versus spa and Lasix.
13. Hyponatremia: The patient developed asymptomatic
hyponatremia. This hyponatremia was not responsive to fluid
restriction. On 6/19/05 , the patient was treated with Lasix and
spa as noted above. TSH , cortisol and uric acid were checked to
rule out other etiologies of hyponatremia. The results of these
studies are pending.
14. Endocrine: The patient has steroid induced diabetes. She was
treated with Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
15. Heme: Anemia: The patient had normal iron studies , B12 and
folate.
16. Thrombocytopenia: The patient&apos;s thrombocytopenia is most
likely secondary to splenic sequestration. An antiplatelet
factor 4 test was sent and is pending.
17. Anticoagulation: The patient had two indications for
anticoagulation. The first was right total knee replacement.
The second was a right lower extremity superficial femoral DVT
discovered on 10/16/05. The goal INR for this patient was
determined to be 1.5 to 2. It was thought that the patient was
at bleeding risk with a higher INR given her known varices and
her thrombocytopenia. From 8/21/05 onward , the patient&apos;s INR was
supertherapeutic and her Coumadin was held. It was thought that
the supertherapeutic INR could relate to Coumadin effects versus
nutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.
18. Musculoskeletal: Osteoporosis: The patient was treated with
cholecalciferol.
19. Physical therapy: The patient was followed by the Physical
Therapy team.
20. Access: The patient had a PIC line in place.
Discharge medications , the remainder of the hospital course and
disposition will be dictated by Dr. Steven Jaksic

Discharge Date: 3/24/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old
African-American female with a
history of chronic pancreatitis who was recently admitted to the
Staho Health 5 of November to 6 of July for her chronic
pancreatitis who returned on the 20 of August with recurrent abdominal pain
and symptoms consistent with her chronic pancreatitis. Prior
studies by abdominal CT scan had showed findings consistent with
chronic pancreatitis , such as multiple calcifications and the
setting of abdominal pain , swelling and peripancreatic increased
attenuation. Findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. The
patient was admitted initially to the medical service.
On admission , the patient had a low grade temperature of 100.2 , was
tachycardic with a heart rate of 131 , respiratory rate 20 , blood
pressure 132/80. Her exam was remarkable for decreased breath
sounds at the right base and a few scattered rhonchi. Cardiac exam
was significant for tachycardia. There was no murmurs , rubs or
gallops appreciated. Abdominal exam was significant for decreased
bowel sounds. She had abdominal tenderness in the midepigastric
region with guarding. Rectal exam was guaiac negative in the
emergency room.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 128 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 95 ,
bicarb 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 433 ,
WBC 17.8 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 370. Liver function tests had
an alk level of 434 , T-bili was 0.6 , D-bili was 0.2 , lipase was
123 , amylase was 37.
The patient had an ultrasound in the Emergency Department which
showed no gallstones. Gallbladder that was mildly distended. A
common bile duct that was dilated to 7 mm as well as intrahepatic
duct dilatation. In addition a 6 cm cyst was identified in the
region of the pancreatic head. EKG showed her to be in sinus
tachycardia with the rate of 122. She had a left axis deviation in
Qs and V1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for pancreatitis , asthma ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , history
of vascular necrosis of both hips , status post a total hip
replacement on the right as well as a total hip replacement on the
left. She has known coronary artery disease , history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease , history of GI bleed. Status post a
Nissen fundoplication with redo. Hypertension. Alpha thalassemia.
History of congestive heart failure. Chronic low back pain
secondary to spinal stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin , Atrovent , Albuterol , Flovent , Elavil ,
Cisapride , Flexeril , Axid , NPH insulin , Cardizem CD ,
lisinopril , Lasix , magnesium oxide , Percocet , Premarin , Provera ,
Prilosec , Lipitor , Tums and multi-vitamins.
ALLERGIES: Aspirin causes facial swelling , palpitations ,
reactive airway disease. Ibuprofen causing GI bleed.
meperidine causing itching , prednisone causing myalgias ,
arthralgias , osteoporosis. Penicillin causes edema. Fophonomide
causes itching. Codeine causes itching. Morphine causes itching.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink or use tobacco. She has two
children. She lives alone.
After admission to the medical service , she was seen by the
surgical service in consultation. Based on clinical findings and
laboratory values , a repeat abdominal CT study was ordered with a
plan for CT guided drainage to rule out a pancreatic abscess. The
CT guided aspirate appeared purulent and was sent for gram and
cultures. Gram stain was positive for gram negative rods and gram
positive cocci in pairs actually growing out Strep viridans and
Klebsiella.
While in the hospital , the patient also developed a urinary tract
infection with yeast , and was started on fluconazole. This too ,
she will be discharged with , to complete a seven-day course. As
well , the patient was felt to have peptic ulcer disease , and was
begun on H. pylori therapy of Biaxin and bismuth , both of which she

Pt was admitted to Vascular with diagnosis of non-healing TMA site &amp;
osteo despite apparent adequate revascularization. His foot was elevated
R foot , Triple Abx ( Vanc/Levo/Flagyl ) , and he was made NPO/IVF for
possible BKA. His hospital course was unremarkable. He did not go to the
OR. DM management was consulted and optimized his insulin regimen as well
as provided DM teaching. On SG6 he underwent an MRI of the RLE revealing
extensive OM of the 3rd&gt;4th metatarsal heads , the cuboid , cunioform as
well as the calcaneuos. Blood cultures that were taken grew out MRSA from
6/7. His remaining blood cultures x 2 over 48 hours remained negetive.
The pt&apos;s WBC never rose above 7.8 with no left shift. His foot remained
stable with exam revealng chronic diabetic dermopathy and 3+ edema , no
open wound with minimal granulation tissue , no fluctuance , no cellulitis ,
no warmth or TTP. The patient will be dc&apos;d and will return for elective
AKA 4/12 after his LE edema resolves. He will continue on linizolid as an
outpatient. On HD4 after an unremarkable hospital course the pt was seen
fit to be dc&apos;d home with services for WTD dressing changes BID. He was
AFVSS , tolerating an ADA diet , and ambulating heel weight bearing only.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Pt will be sent home with WTD dressing changes BID. Keep leg elevated
while in bed. Will need to continue the linizolid x 10 days; will need
qweekly CBC check for thrombocytopenia. Pt. should
seek medical attention if there is increasing leg or arm pain , groin
swelling , T&gt;101.5 , redness/puss at the incision site , altered mental
status , symptoms of stroke ( eg HA , change in vision/speech , unilateral
loss of motor/sensation ).

hospitalization. We have made some changes to your medications. We
increased your blood pressure medication: Lisinopril from 5mg to 15mg
once a day. We started you on a medication for anemia: ferrous
gluconate which you should take 3 times a day along with colace a stool
softener which you should take twice a day. We also increased your lasix
frm 20mg once a day to 40mg twice a day. As discussed with you , your
echocardiogram ( ultrasound of your heart ) showed that you had some
abnormality with the functioning of your heart which may in part explain
your shortness of breath especially on exertion. It is extremely important
to follow up with your primary care physician Dr. Clague appt 7/12 at
12:10pm and your cardiologist Dr. Dodgen on 2/16 at 1:30pm. If you
have trouble breathing , have chest pain please seek medical attention as
soon as possible.

Discharge Date: 7/19/1993
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FLUTTER.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1. STATUS POST D/C CARDIOVERSION.
2. STATUS POST MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT.
3. HISTORY OF RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Dar is a 71 year old woman
with a history of mitral valve replacement , atrial fibrillation ,
diabetes mellitus , who presents with light-headedness x 1 day.
Mrs. Cedars has a history of rheumatic heart disease and is
status post commissurotomy in 1965 and a St. Jude&apos;s mitral valve
replacement in 1991. In October 1992 she presented in atrial
fibrillation which was well controlled on Quinidine. The Quinidine
was discontinued the following year in April when the patient had a
syncopal episode. At that time , she ruled out for myocardial
infarction and failed Sotalol with increasing PR and QT intervals.
Holter study was negative at that time. Persantine scan showed no
ST changes noted and a fixed defect was present. The patient was
discharged on Lopressor. On August , 1993 she was admitted with
right ankle pain , right lower extremity swelling. Lineis were
negative at that time. On 10/5/93 she was admitted in atrial
flutter with II:I conduction. Trial of procainamide was complicated
by increasing QT intervals. The Procainimide was therefore
discontinued and the Propafenone was begun. The patient underwent
successful DC cardioversion and was discharged on Propafenone 225
t.i.d. and Lasix 80 q day. Since the morning before admission she
felt light-headed and sweaty. She began to run out of Propafenone
two days before admission and decreased the dose to 150 mg three
times a day. She felt her heart was going slower than normal. This
was worse when standing or walking. However , she had no chest
pain , shortness of breath , loss of consciousness. She had no
diarrhea , no vomiting , her blood sugars have been in the usual
range of 180-200 mg%. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As noted above. The
patient has clean coronary arteries by catheterization October
1991.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a very pleasant female , appearing
younger than her stated age , in no acute
distress. Her blood pressure is 134/80 without orthostatic change.
Her mouth appears dry but is otherwise unremarkable.
Cardiovascular examination notes a regular rate and rhythm with a
prominent mid-systolic prosthetic valve click. There were
bilateral crackles at the bases. The abdominal and rectal
examinations are normal , stool is guaiac negative. Extremities
showed pigmentation changes in bilateral lower extremities with
well preserved pulses except the dorsalis pedis pulses which are
weak. Neurological examination is unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at
78 beats per minute , axis 145 degrees , PR interval
of 132 milliseconds , no significant change from previous EKG from
February 1993.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , placed on cardiac
monitor and Holter monitor. On the morning
following admission she was clearly in atrial flutter with II:I
conduction block as confirmed by the Holter monitor. Her
prothrombin time was 25.2 , therefore , on the second hospital day ,
she underwent successful DC cardioversion with 52 joules. The
procedure was carried out without complications; afterwards , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block and a
PR interval of 300-320 milliseconds. The patient was observed
through the next day , remained in normal sinus rhythm except for
short periods of SVT with sinus pause. She was asymptomatic and was
able to exercise around the hospital floor and up and down the
stairs. Anticoagulation. The patient is maintained on chronic
Coumadin anticoagulation and at the time of admission she was
continued on her outpatient maintenance of 7.5 mg q hs. However ,
over the first hospital day prothrombin time increased from 22.3 on
admission to 28.6. Therefore , her Coumadin was held. The
prothrombin time was 29.1. The prothrombin time on discharge was
32 , INR of 3.3 and the patient was instructed to continue on 5 mg
of Coumadin q hs and to see Dr. Dry in the clinic for PT check in
the next week.

Discharge Date: 3/21/1995
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 42 year old female with a
history of variegate porphyria ,
insulin dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass graft , and hypercholesterolemia who had
experienced five days of confusion , weakness , change in bowel
habits , and fatigue with flashing sensations of anxiety with
emotional lability. Patient had a history of variegate porphyria
for about fifteen years , was followed by Dr. Nigel Wickenhauser , and she
had been relatively free of porphyria attacks with the last major
one approximately twelve years ago with symptoms similar to those
she was experiencing at the time of this admission. In April
1994 , she had a mild porphyria attack which was managed by stopping all
her medications. She intermittently had skin lesions ,
especially with sun exposure. She had never been phlebotomized or
received other treatments. In the past two months , she had been
taking Ativan of 3-4 mg q.d. for anxiety. She stopped taking
Ativan on January , 1995 and after this abrupt stopping of this
medication , she started to have feelings of disorientation ,
confusion , and fatigue with emotional lability. She also was in
Idaho with extensive sun exposure in the last two weeks. She
contacted Dr. Furuya who advised her to increase her carbohydrate
intake to about 400 grams a day , however , her symptoms progressed.
Two days prior to admission , she felt weak and while standing , her
legs gave way without losing consciousness. She felt weak
throughout the week before admission with no vertigo , tinnitus , or
ataxia. She also felt paresthesias of the hands and feet but not
perioral and she also experienced episodes of flushing and
tremulousness with a feeling of rushing sensation in the chest with
no tachycardia associated at the time of this symptomatology. She
had no fevers with the sensation of flushing and feeling of burning
up. She had several bouts of diarrhea intermingled with
constipation. On the day of admission , patient became confused and
disoriented while driving and she came to see Dr. Heyn in the
VVH Clinic. She was admitted for evaluation of a possible
porphyria attack. Of note , the only new medications that she had
been taking was chloral hydrate for the last five days and
Compazine with one dose.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Insulin dependent diabetes. 2 )
Coronary artery disease status post PTCA
times two and a coronary artery bypass graft of the left anterior
descending in 6/25 Exercise tolerance test was noted before
catheterization and she had a catheterization in 1/10 for angina.
She had a patent LIMA graft , 60% proximal left anterior descending
lesion , and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. 3 )
Hypercholesterolemia , did not tolerate cholestyramine. 4 ) Status
post left ulna entrapment release two months ago. 5 )
Hypertension. 6 ) Status post excisional biopsy of the left breast; the
pathology of the lesion was diabetic mastopathy.
ALLERGIES: Morphine which gave her a rash and patient avoided
multiple medications which were known to worsen
porphyria such as sulfa drugs ( not allgergies )
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: At home , patient took insulin NPH 25 units in
the morning with Regular 10 units in the
morning , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Compazine 5 mg
q.6h. p.r.n. anxiety of which she took only one dose , and chloral
hydrate 500 to 1000 mg q.h.s. for five days.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient was married for fifteen years with one
son and no history of smoking or ethanol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a pale and anxious white female
in no apparent distress with a temperature
of 99.5 , blood pressure 134/70 , heart rate of 92 , respiratory rate
of 18 , and O2 saturation of 97% on room air. HEENT: Examination
was significant for oropharynx with upper dentures and sclerae were
anicteric. NECK: Supple with no jugular venous distention , no
lymphadenopathy , and thyroid was not palpable. CHEST: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with no costovertebral angle tenderness.
BREASTS: Examination was notable for fully healed scar of the left
breast. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination showed a regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , and 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at
the apex. ABDOMEN: Soft with good bowel sounds , non-tender , and
non-distended. EXTREMITIES: 1+ pedal pulses bilaterally and no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. SKIN: Examination showed a blister
of the left hand fourth and fifth digit interspace and healed
lesions on the right hand. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed her
to be alert and oriented times three with a normal mental status
examination with no confusion noted. Cranial nerves were intact ,
motor was symmetric of 3-4/5 on all muscle groups , sensory
examination was significant for decrease to light touch in the
distal feet and hands , deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and 1-2+
throughout , and coordination showed rapid alternating movements and
finger-to-nose both within normal limits. Gait was mildly wide
based with normal heel-to-toe walk , she had no pronator drift , and
Romberg was positive.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was significant for a BUN of
17 , creatinine of 1.0 , glucose was 364 ,
liver function tests were within normal limits , white count was
7.2 , hematocrit was 36 , and platelet count was 266.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for possible porphyria
attack versus Ativan withdrawal symptoms versus
anxiety attack. Neurology consultation was obtained who felt that
patient&apos;s peripheral neuropathy was probably secondary to
longstanding diabetes but felt that some of her symptomatology
could be consistent with porphyria. Patient was also seen by
Psychiatry who felt that this episode was consistent with
generalized anxiety disorder separated by post dysthymia and
suggested phenothiazines which are proven to be safe in porphyria
for treatment. She was started on Trilafon 2 to 4 mg p.o. p.r.n.
q.6h. for anxiety. The patient was also seen to be orthostatic
which was felt to be secondary to dehydration secondary to poor
p.o. intake prior to admission. She was also hyperglycemic on
admission which may have contributed to her dehydration. She was
treated with normal saline boluses and her orthostasis improved.
Her Lopressor was also held with this episode of orthostasis. The
Watson-Schwartz test done by Dr. Mohar on patient very early in the admission
was negative which made an acute porphyria attack very
unlikely. These episodes were felt to be secondary to a
combination of anxiety attack and rapid taper of Ativan which she
had been taking at moderately high doses for the last two months.
Patient also developed urinary tract infection symptoms and her
urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of E. coli which
were pansensitive. She was started on Keflex 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
which is shown to be safe in porphyria.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home on July in good
condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , insulin NPH 25
units subcutaneously q.a.m. , insulin
regular 10 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Trilafon 2 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
and Keflex 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Dario Rodriquz

herpetic whitlow and bacterial superinfection/cellulitis.
1. ID/Cellultis overlying herpetic whitlow--Pt&apos;s infection appeared to be
markedly improved from ED presentation at time of evaluation by admitting
Medicine team. However , given h/o SLE and prednisone use , making Pt
functionally immunosupressed , indication for conservative management w/
admission and observation reasonable. Per record , Pt does not have
official Dx of DM2--?elevated Gluc in past 2/2 steroid use. Pt very
resistant to staying in hospital , as she felt her finger was much
improved , pain completely resolved , margins all receeded from marked
borders at admission , no f/c , no joint pain. Reviewed Ortho hand recs ,
plan w/ Medicine attending and Pt. As Pt displayed excellent understanding
of Dx , indications for return to hospital , and desire for adherence ,
agreed to d/c her home from the ED w/ oral Clindamycin 450 mg po qid and
close f/u in LOMU MEDICAL CENTER w/ PCP on 10/17 Given a final dose of Clinda 600
mg IV before d/c. Decision made not to provide Rx for herpetic whitlow at

DNR/DNI.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the temperature is 98.6 ,
heart rate 70 , respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 133/61 , oxygen
saturation was 79% on room air and increased in 94% on 3 L nasal
cannula. In general , the patient appeared comfortable with
pleasant and convulsant and blind. Neck showed a JVP of 7.
Chest exam was with left basilar crackles no wheezes. Heart was
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at
the left upper sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended with normal bowel sounds. Extremities with no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were significant for potassium of
4.5 , BUN of 23 , creatinine 1.6 , which is at her baseline of 1.4
to 1.6. White blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit 27.3 from a
baseline of 26 to 29 , platelets of 347 , 000. Coagulation studies
were normal. Liver function tests were normal. Cardiac enzymes
were negative. Chest x-ray showed no change in the left lower
lobe infiltrate , since 10/20/06. An EKG showed Q-wave
flattening , but no changes from her prior EKGs. Normal sinus
rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This is an 86-year-old woman with multiple medical
problems including congestive heart failure , diabetes , and
adrenal insufficiency , who presents with recurrent fevers through
levofloxacin and vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious Disease. Initially , the source of her repeated
fevers was unclear. Multiple cultures were sent including urine
cultures , stool studies , peripheral blood cultures and blood
cultures from the PICC sputum cultures and induced sputum with
testing for PCP , given her history of chronic steroid uses
without PCP prophylaxis. All of these came back negative with
the exception of one blood culture from the PICC , which grew
coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus. So , the PICC line was
discontinued and the tip sent for culture , which was negative.
After discontinuation of the PICC line , the patient did not have
any further fevers. The remainder of her admission , which was
greater than 72 hours. The induced sputum for PCP was also
negative and the patient was then started on PCP prophylaxis with
Mepron ( given her sulfa allergy ) to be continued until she had
completed her gradual tapper off of steroids. She completed the
levofloxacin and vancomycin courses , which were started on the
previous admission , for pneumonia and did not have any further
fevers after completing these antibiotics. A PPD was placed ,
which was negative.
2. Endocrine. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism ,
adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroids in the past
and insulin-dependent diabetes. Her TSH was checked and was
normal on admission. So , she was continued on her home dose of
Synthroid. Further instructions through her primary care
provider. Her hydrocortisone was slightly decreased and her slow
taper will be further directed by her primary care provider after
discharge. Her insulin regimen was up titrated with the addition
of the q.a.c. Novalog , given her high fingerstick blood glucoses.
She should continue on this increased regimen after discharge.
3. Pulmonary. On admission , the patient was noted to be hypoxic
on room air with an oxygen saturation of 79% to 80% , which
increased to 93% on 2 L to 3 L of nasal cannula. Given this new
hypoxia and her chronic decreased ambulation , she was sent for a
CT angiogram of the chest , which was negative for PE. The study
also shows small bilateral pleural effusion and mild pulmonary
edema. Resolution of her previous pneumonia and possibly
reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Given this data , she was
restarted on Lasix with diuresis , titrated to 1 L negative per
day and was sound well. Given this data , she was restarted on
Lasix with the diuresis titrated to 1 L negative per day and
responded well. She had decreasing shortness of breath and
improved room air oxygen saturation up to 85% at the time of
discharge. She is continued to be maintained on oxygen of 2 L
nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation and is anticipated to
have a successful gradual wean from oxygen as her diuresis
continue after discharge. The Pulmonary Service was consulted
and followed her agreeing with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.
They also recommended a followup noncontrast chest CT in 2 to 4
weeks after discharge to reevaluate her mediastinal
lymphadenopathy after a period of diuresis. A followup
appointment was made with Dr. Soucek at the Chest Clinic at
Sio Sane Hospital for two weeks following discharge.
Pulmonary function test were completed , which showed a
restrictive defect , which the Pulmonary Service felt could be
attributed to her volume overload. An echo showed an increased
pulmonary artery systolic pressure at 47 plus the right atrial
pressure consistent with previous echo done in September of 2005.
Thus , this was not considered to be new pathology , nor likely
related to her new hypoxia.
4. Hematologic. The patient has a known diagnosis of iron
deficiency anemia as well as anemia of chronic disease and is
maintaining on iron and epoetin as an outpatient. There were no
signs or symptoms of bleeding throughout this admission and she
not required a blood transfusion at any point. She should
continue on her outpatient regimen of iron and epoetin after
discharge. Iron studies done on this admission showed adequate
iron repletion with her current regimen.
5. Cardiovascular. There was no evidence of ischemia throughout
the admission. Given her findings of pulmonary edema on chest CT
and her history of diastolic congestive heart failure , she was
started on Lasix 20 mg IV b.i.d. with effective diuresis noted.
This was transitioned to a p.o. regimen of 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
which will be continued after discharge and titrated to her
weight loss. She was also continued on her outpatient Zocor ,
Norvasc and lisinopril.
6. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. She received Mucomyst and bicarbonate in her IV
fluids , prior to her CT angiogram of the chest with prophylaxis
against contrast nephropathy. Her creatinine remained stable at
1.6 for remainder of the admission , which was greater than 72
hours. All mediations were appropriately renally dosed. She
should continue followup with her primary care provider regarding
her chronic renal insufficiency in the future.
7. Fluid , Electrolytes , and Nutrition. The patient was
maintained on any IV fluids except as prophylaxis for her CT
angiogram. The potassium and magnesium were repeated as needed
and she was maintained on the renal , cardiac ADA diet.
8. Prophylaxis: She was maintained on t.i.d. subq heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and Nexium for GI prophylaxis as well as an
aggressive bowel regimen , given her history of chronic
constipation.
9. Code Status: The patient is DNR/DNI and her son John Durazo , is the healthcare proxy.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged back to Mclemens Hospital Of County to continue physical therapy to regain some independence
with her activities of daily living and more specifically to
regain some independence and the activities , which she enjoys
such as playing the piano. She will have followup with her
primary care provider , Dr. Pacetti regarding general plan for her
care including gradual hydrocortisone taper , her Lasix dosing and
her diabetes management. She will also followup at the chest
clinic with Dr. Tobola regarding her PCP prophylaxis and the
possibly of repeat chest CT regarding the question of her
mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen on CT during this admission.

felt nauseated , anorexic , had some chills , and took her temperature
later in the day and found a fever of 102. The patient also had a
moderate headache , but has no nuchal rigidity and no difficulty
with moving her head. She also has an occasional cough , which has
been nonproductive , for the past few days. The patient has no
other localizing symptoms - no hemoptysis , no chest pain , no
palpitations , orthopnea , edema , dysphagia , abdominal pain ,
diarrhea , hematuria , dysuria , flank pain , vaginal discharge , edema ,
rash , joint pain , claudication or scalp tenderness. The patient
has no moved her bowels for four days , but this is not unusual for
her.

ALLERGIES: Sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired Hebrew teacher. The
patient lives with her husband in a retirement
home. Tobacco - One pack per day for 20 years. Quit 20 years ago.
Alcohol - Occasional.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s mother had a stroke in her 60&apos;s.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission showed a white
blood cell count of 8 , 200 , with 15 bands. ALT
18 , AST 26 , alkaline phosphatase 64 , total bilirubin 0.2 , ESR 55 ,
hematocrit 35.8. Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , creatinine 1.3.
A spinal tap was done which revealed the gram stain revealed no
organisms , no polys and no epithelial cells. Only one white cell
was noted in the CSF , glucose 92 , protein 46. The patient&apos;s
urinalysis showed 5 - 7 white blood cells , 2+ bacteria. The
patient&apos;s chest x-ray showed no infiltrates , no free air. KUB
showed no signs of obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient&apos;s Imuran was held because it was
thought that this could be a possible cause of
her fever. She was started on Ceftriaxone two grams , Mezlin and
Gentamicin in the Emergency Room. The patient&apos;s blood and urine
cultures were all negative , as was the spinal culture. The patient
improved steadily , and the day following admission she had been
afebrile x 24 hours saturating 94% on room air; therefore , the plan
was to discharge her. On the floor the patient received two grams
of Ceftazidime x one and then was taken off of antibiotics.
On the afternoon of 29 of July the patient&apos;s oxygen saturation
suddenly dropped. She complained of feeling short of breath and
nauseous. Her room air saturation was 82% when these symptoms
first developed. Over the next 30 minutes the patient
decompensated and her oxygenation was steadily increased; however ,
on 100% nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation was less than
80% and her skin appeared mottled. A portable chest x-ray showed
mild congestive heart failure. The patient&apos;s EKG showed a normal
sinus rhythm , no axis changes and no ST changes. The patient had
received 100 mg of IV Compazine for nausea; otherwise , no new
medications since admission. Her temperature was 100.5 at 2:00
p.m. Because of her rapid decompensation a code green was called
and she was intubated and transferred to the MICU. ABG showed a pH
of 7.35 , a pCO2 of 44 , and a pO2 of 96 following intubation. Blood
pressure remained , during this time , at 130 to 200 over 70 to 90
with heartrates in the 70&apos;s to 90&apos;s. During her rapid
decompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with no
effect. The cause of the patient&apos;s sudden decompensation was
unclear. During the period of rapid decompensation the patient got
a total of 100 mg of IV Lasix. Her lung exam showed some crackles ,
but she did not appear to be all that wet. A chest x-ray three
hours post intubation showed diffuse fluffy infiltrates in the
bilateral lung fields , more central than peripheral. No effusion
was noted. Based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a VQ scan
was not done. It was thought that the rapid decompensation was due
to either pulmonary edema ( the patient had been on 150 cc an hour
of IV fluids for approximately 24 hours because she was dehydrated
when she first came in ) , blood , or pneumonia. The patient was
covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime ( for Pseudomonas ) ,
Levofloxacin ( for Legionella ) , and Pentamidine ( for PCP ). The
patient was also given 50 mg of IV Solu-Medrol b.i.d. Numerous
laboratory studies were sent off including: RSV , influenza ,
parainfluenza , VRE , Legionella , PCP , adenovirus , acid-fast bacilli ,
CH50 , and ANA , all of which were negative. Urine and blood
cultures were negative as well. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was
thought to be an unlikely cause , given that she had a normal left
ventricular size and an ejection fraction of 50% in an
echocardiogram done right after being intubated. There was also no
evidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or RV strain.
She did well over the two days following intubation and was
extubated on 6 of May A bronchoscopy was considered , given the
patient&apos;s history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolved
over the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary.
The patient&apos;s oxygen saturation following extubation was 95% on
three liters nasal cannula and continued to be in the mid 90&apos;s once
she was weaned to room air in the subsequent two days. All
antibiotics were stopped while the patient was in the MICU except
for Levofloxacin , which was continued for a seven to ten day
course. The patient was gradually tapered off of the IV
Solu-Medrol and put on a p.o. prednisone taper starting at 80 mg
p.o. q day. The Pulmonary Consult Team saw her when she was back
on the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared to
resolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it was
decided that this need not be pursued at the present. The patient
did well over the next several days and the day prior to discharge
was saturating at 94% on room air and received 10 mg of p.o.
prednisone. The etiology of the patient&apos;s sudden decompensation
was never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonary
edema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to a
viral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.

ATTENDING: FRANKLIN DIPPEL M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 63-year-old female with type-2 diabetes and
hypertension and history of perihilar mass greater than 4 cm on
the CT scan from A Jaland Medical Center in September 2002 at which time she
refused biopsy. She now presents with nausea and vomiting. The
patient presents with two to three weeks of decrease p.o. intake
and diminished appetite in the past week. She has also had
nausea , vomiting , and epigastric pain after meals. Vomiting was
nonbloody and nonbilious. The patient has had a 10-pound weight
loss in the past two months. She also complains of myalgias ,
malaise , fatigue , dizziness , occasional shortness of breath ,
dyspnea on exertion , and a nonproductive cough. She denies chest
pain , palpitations , headaches , visual changes , or loss of
consciousness. She presented to her PCP on the day prior to
admission. Routine chemistries were checked and calcium was
found to be 14 , potassium 5.7 , and creatinine 4.6. She was
therefore sent to the Stter Hoodsress Mofoote Hospital Emergency Room. In the emergency
room she was afebrile , her heart rate was 56 , her blood pressure
was 147/70 , and she was saturating 98% on room air. Her EKG
showed bradycardia with no ST changes and no big T waves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Type-2 diabetes , hypertension , perihilar lung mass greater than 4
cm on CT from September 2002 at Alpe Health Care at which time the
patient refused biopsy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 98.4 , heart rate 56 , blood pressure 147/70 , and
saturation 98% on room air. No cervical lymphadenopathy. No
neck masses. No thyromegaly. Chest with bilateral crackles
2/3rd of the way up , which are per PCP are chronic.
Cardiovascular , distant heart sounds , S1 , S2. No rubs , murmurs ,
or gallops. JVP flat. No carotid bruits. Abdomen , soft and
nondistended. Epigastrium is tender to palpation. No masses.
No inguinal lymphadenopathy. No peripheral edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Hypercalcemia. The patient&apos;s initial calcium was 13.2 , a
decrease to the mid 9 range with aggressive IV fluids. Studies
sent included PTH = 26 , vitamin D = 27 , TSH = 1.69 , and PTHrP
which is still pending at the time of discharge. The patient had
a negative PPD placed three induced sputum for TB , which were all
negative. SPEP and UPEP had increased gamma globulins , but he
was polyclonal and no end spikes. A chest CT showed large
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with multiple 2-3 cm nodes. No
intraparenchymal disease. A mediastinoscopy for biopsy and
intraoperative BAL were done and the pathology and microbiology
are pending at the time of discharge. Abdominal CT was negative.
2. Renal. Baseline creatinine is 2-3. Creatinine increased to
6 on admission and was down to 3.4 with aggressive hydration by
the time of discharge. There were no casts in her urine. Her
phenol was 11.6% on admission. It was thought that her acute
renal failure was secondary to prerenal azotemia as well as a
component of ATN and tubular damage from the hypercalcemia. Her
creatinine remains stable around 3.4 on discharge.
3. Pulmonary. She did not have any pulmonary symptoms except
for a mild cough that had resolved on admission. She did have
persistent bibasilar crackles , which were old per her PCP. She
had no shortness of breath and her saturations remain greater
than 96% on room air throughout admission. Her chest x-ray
showed no evidence of infiltrates , but did show right mediastinal
widening and calcific nodularity in the right upper lobes. Chest
CT showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above and also
a small area of tree-in-bud inflammation. She was ruled out for
TB with induced sputum x 3. Mediastinoscopy biopsy on 1/5/04 ,
results are pending.
4. Heme. Anemia workup. Iron 49 , TIBC 256 , B12 555 , folate
normal , ferritin 102 , reticulocyte 7.9 , and Epogen level 19. She
has a normocytic anemia , but given her chronic renal
insufficiency she has a mild degree of iron deficiency. The
likely etiology of her anemia is secondary to renal disease.
Iron supplementation was started. Hematocrit was stable
throughout admission.
5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and was
hypoglycemic on admission. This resolved with hydration. Her
PTH was 26 , her vitamin D was 27 , PTHrP is pending. She was kept
on a regular insulin sliding scale during the admission. She
resumed her NPH dose as an outpatient on discharge. She will
need a close follow up of blood sugars as an outpatient. Her TSH
was 1.69.
6. Skin. The patient had a pruritic rash on her right back ,
which appeared about a week prior to admission. She had a few
scattered 1-2 cm dark nodular regions over the mid right back.
She did not have pustules or discharge from lesions. She also
had areas of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation on her left upper
back.
DISPOSITION.
The patient is discharged home in stable condition. She will
follow up in one week with her PCP Dr. Gensel He will need to
discontinue the stitches on her neck and follow up all the
results and arrange treatment as appropriate. Instructions were
given to the patient in Spanish.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Cardizem SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , metoprolol XL 75 mg q.d. , NPH at
home doses , iron 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet one tablet p.o.
q.6h. p.r.n. pain for the few days following the mediastinoscopy.
The patient is discharged in stable condition with follow up with
Dr. Alligood to be arranged in one week.

Discharge Date: 5/16/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 22 year old , gravida V para
0314 , at 24 weeks , now with severe
frontal headache and scintillations. Dating is by the last
menstrual period and an early ultrasound which placed her at
approximately 24 weeks. She presented with a three and a half day
history of severe frontal headaches with scintillations. There was
no relief with Tylenol , aspirin or Fioricet. She also stated she
had marked polydipsia for four days. She denied abdominal pain or
swelling. She has a history of preeclampsia with a previous twin
gestation. She does note fetal activity. At this juncture , I
should note that much of this history is as per patient and is
somewhat unreliable. PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: C-section for
twins; previous C-section for singleton; history by patient of
preeclampsia. PAST HISTORY: Initially she admitted to no past
medical problems , however , upon reviewing her chart the following
is obvious: chronic hypertension; seizure disorder following motor
vehicle accident for which she is on valproic acid , no clearly
documented recent seizures; history of asthma for which she takes
medicines p.r.n.; history of behavioral disorders with question of
pseudoseizures in the past; obesity; multiple drug allergies;
cholecystectomy in 1990; appendectomy at age 14; motor vehicle
accident with V-P shunt placement in 1980; facial reconstruction
times three in 1980; superficial vascular surgery in 1989 for
varicosities of the lower extremities. SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies
tobacco , ethanol or drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed an obese white female in mild
distress. The pupils are equal , round and
reactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , no
papilledema. Good facial movements. No oral lesions. The chest
was clear. The heart showed a regular rate and rhythm. The
abdomen was soft and nontender with a fetal heart rate in the
140&apos;s. The extremities showed trace edema. The neuro exam showed
cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Reflexes were 1+ without
clonus. The strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper and
right lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as she
seemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time of
exam. She also demonstrated decreased fine finger movements on the
right.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 ) Headache. The patient has a history
of chronic headaches for which she was maintained
on Fioricet in the past. Over the first week of hospitalization ,
she complained of increasing headache that prevented her from
looking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating out
of the bed. At times , she complained of intermittent visual
symptoms. These headaches were not completely relieved by Demerol ,
Percocet or Tylenol. She was eventually tried on Fioricet which
apparently produced good relief of the headaches. She was seen by
neurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam with
findings localized to the right side. Apparently she has a history
of this abnormality in the past. A CT scan revealed what was
apparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident. An
MRI was entirely within normal limits. She refused a lumbar
puncture. At this time , the headaches are thought to be either
vascular in origin or psychogenic. She was continued on Fioricet
at the time of discharge. Problem #2 ) Hypertension. She had
elevated blood pressures of 150-160 over as high as 110 upon
admission. She has a history of chronic hypertension in the past
and was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before.
She had a negative work up for PET , including repeat 24 hour urines
and repeat PET labs. As well , she had no physical findings
consistent with PET. Given her history of chronic hypertension , we
felt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated by
pregnancy. She was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , with
good control. She was discharged to home on labetolol. Problem
#3 ) History of seizure disorder. She carries the diagnosis of a
seizure disorder , although this is , at least recently , poorly
documented. She has been on valproic acid in the past and has been
taking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her own
throughout this pregnancy. She has been taking 250 mg a week. She
last noted an obvious seizure three years ago. It is not clear
that this was witnessed by anyone else. While in the hospital , she
had an EEG which suggested some slowing in the right parietal
region. There was no clear seizure activity seen on EEG. She
called us to her room on several episodes which she described as
seizures. These seizures were witnessed by several physicians and
were remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well as
abnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events. It was our
feeling that these were not true seizures. Indeed , reviewing her
chart , she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizures
similar to these in the past. Given her multiple drug allergies ,
including Dilantin , phenobarb and tegretol , we felt limited in our
therapeutic options. We did elect to increase her dose of valproic
acid as this has apparently been effective in the past. She will
continue this as an outpatient. Problem #4 ) Nausea and vomiting.
She complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latter
part of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. The
etiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , although
apparently associated with some diarrhea. As much as was possible ,
work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. We
elected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however ,
she declined further IV&apos;s. In fact , she became quite vocal in her
demand to go home. She understands our concerns as to the risks of
poor p.o. intake and insists she will be able to take in p.o.&apos;s at
home. Given her feelings in this regard , we have elected to
discharge her for a trial of outpatient management. Follow up will
be in the clinic. Should she show evidence of compromise or
dehydration , she will be readmitted. Problem #5 ) Psychosocial.
The patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioral
disorders. It is difficult to sort out what part of her
symptomatology is organic and what , if any , is inorganic. She was
seen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had a
significant conflict in her home life. We have counseled her as
much as possible throughout her stay. She has seen both social
services and psychiatry , however , she is at best reluctant to avail
herself of these services. Our plan at the time of discharge is
for follow up with DSS. As well , we have emphasized our
availability to the patient at all times and tried to be as
supportive as possible in these circumstances.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for a trial of management
at home. The etiology of her discomfort is somewhat
obscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obvious
major organic pathology , including PET , central CNS processes and
fulminant hypertension.

Discharge Date: 8/26/2003
ATTENDING: AL DAMIAN DUMBAR MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Stented basilar occlusion.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS:
None , Q-wave myocardial infarction.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization done on 3/14/03.
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
This is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension and ____ fibrillation
managed on aspirin and Plavix who presents to the Maven Health emergency department complaining of lethargy , diplopia
and vertigo. Further information regarding her symptomatology is
not currently available as the patient&apos;s initial mental status
was quite poor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , diabetes , glaucoma ,
hypercholesterolemia , history of alcohol abuse , history of
coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Not available currently in detail but included aspirin 325 mg and
Plavix 25 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES:
She is allergic to NSAIDs , penicillin and Diltiazem.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:
Revealed her to be lethargic , obese. Her face is slightly
asymmetric with some left cheek swelling. Her neck revealed no
bruits. Her heart was irregularly irregular. Her lungs revealed
bibasilar crackles. Her extremities had 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally. Neurologic examination: The only focal findings
were a transient skewed deviation of her eyes. Further
information regarding this is not currently available. Focal
weakness and numbness were not delineated upon initial
evaluation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit
given her initial imaging findings. These findings were that she
had an occlusion , flat high-grade stenosis of the distal basilar
artery. There was no acute infarction noted. Based on these
findings , she was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit
and placed on intravenous heparin. Her neurologic status
gradually improved throughout her hospitalization. She did not
complain of diplopia after the first day of her hospitalization.
She also was quite awake after the first day of her
hospitalization. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging done on
10/21/03 revealed a new left cerebellar infarct with persistent
high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery which did appear a bit
more patent than the initial scan done on 10/20/03. At the time
of her discharge , she was being transitioned from heparin to
Coumadin and she was neurologically intact. With regard to her
cardiovascular status , the patient initially ruled in for an MI
based on positive cardiac markers. Her peak troponin-I was 11.02
and her peak CKMB was 18.4. She had lateral T-wave inversions
that were new compared to her old EKGs. She was brought to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory where it was found that she
had multiple moderate stenoses but without any high-grade or
critical stenoses. She was found however to have an elevated
wedge pressure of approximately 30 cm. Echocardiogram done on
10/30/03 revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. She had a mildly
dilated left atrium. It was found that she had moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Her pulmonary artery pressures were
elevated to 51 mL of mercury. She also is found to have moderate
mitral regurgitation. Based on the findings of her
catheterization and elevated wedge pressures , the patient was
diuresed relatively aggressively. She was also given high doses
of beta-blockade. Her troponin and CKMB levels did decrease
after this. She remained weight controlled with beta-blockade.
There was some discussion of possibly cardioverting her , but
given her recent stroke this will be deferred. With regard to
her blood pressure management , she has been managed while at an
inpatient with hydralazine and Lopressor. A decision was made
not to introduce an ACE inhibitor at this time given her recent
_____ and her baseline renal insufficiency ( 1.8-1.9 ). The
addition of an ACE inhibitor may be indicated at some point in
the near future.
DISCHARGE PLAN:
The patient will be discharged to Mitent Health
Hospital.
FOLLOW UP PLANS:
The patient will see her primary care physician , Marco Kenouo ,
at the Department of Medicine on 9/26/04. She will see Dr.
Doyle Ghamdi of Neurology on 2/12/03 at 4 p.m. She will see Dr.
Toney Montagna at the Department of Cardiology on 10/4/04.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , heparin drip being transitioned to
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. with goal INR of 2-3 , folic acid 1 mg
p.o. q.d. , hydralazine 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. , metoprolol 125 mg p.o.

Discharge Date: 8/5/2005
ATTENDING: BORIA , DARELL M.D.
DIAGNOSIS: Multiple joint sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mcumber is a 73-year-old
gentleman who in October of this year developed enterococcus sepsis
of both knees , his right shoulder and left wrist. He was taken
to the operating room in the beginning of July for irrigation
and debridement of the aforementioned joints. The cultures were
significant for enterococcus and he was started on IV antibiotics
and discharged to Motle Health Services . At Cial Memorial Hospital , he continued to
complain about bilateral knee swelling as well as shoulder and
wrist pain and was therefore brought back for a repeat wash out
and reassessment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: BPH , pacemaker , atrial fibrillation.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post bilateral total knee
replacement approximately 10 years ago , status post left ankle
ORIF.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lopressor 50 mg PO b.i.d.
2. Multivitamin.
3. Lisinopril 7.5 mg PO daily.
4. Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
5. Digoxin 0.25 mg PO daily.
6. Nexium 40 mg PO daily.
7. Unasyn.
8. Gentamicin IV.
9. Coumadin 7.5 mg PO q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Stable vital signs.
Temperature 97.8. Left wrist tender to examination with
decreased strength of wrist extension , finger flexion and
intrinsics to 3 out of 5. Right shoulder and both knees with
only slightly decreased range of motion and little pain on
passive range of motion. Neurovascularly intact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
9/3/05 for arthroscopic irrigation and debridement of both knees
as well as the right shoulder. There was a small effusion in
both knees which was aspirated prior to the irrigation and sent
to the laboratory. These cultures show no growth to date with
negative gram stain. The right shoulder was ??_____?? without
effusion. Intraoperative exam: No purulent discharge was
encountered , however there was mild inflammatory response in both
knees and right shoulder. The left wrist was treated with
irrigation and debridement as well as a proximal ??_____??
carpectomy by Dr. Edmond Augustave from hand surgery.
Intraoperative cultures for fluid aspirate as well as bone tissue
from the proximal ??_____?? carpectomy demonstrated coag negative
staph. Postoperatively , the patient was seen by physical therapy
for mobilization and weightbearing as tolerated with free range
of motion of both knees and the right shoulder. He was placed in
an Orthomold splint for the left wrist. On request of the
patient&apos;s daughter , Medicine was consulted but had little
recommendations beyond small adjustments of his cardiovascular
medications.
Also , Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended a change
of antibiotics to ampicillin and gentamicin and vancomycin to
treat the coag negative staph in the left wrist aspirate as well
as to continue treatment of the previous enterococcus infection.
No cultures from the current admission have demonstrated
enterococcus. The patient also underwent a transthoracic echo ,
however , the report is pending at the time of discharge.
Finally , the patient was seen by Nutrition who recommended a
??_____?? protein diet with supplements t.i.d.
Lastly , the patient presents with chronically elevated PTT in a
range of 40 to 70. After discussion with hematology , an
inhibitor screen was sent , however , after the serum was
neutralized , PTT was found to be normal so likely the chronic PTT
elevation was secondary to a hep block in his PICC line.
The patient progressed well and was ambulating with minimal
support at the time of discharge. He has remained afebrile with
benign-appearing incisions. He will be transferred to Mount Coursven Community Healthcare for further mobilization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ampicillin 3000 mg IV q. 4 hours x6 weeks.
2. Digoxin 0.25 mg PO daily.
3. Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
4. Gentamicin sulfate 400 mg IV daily x6 weeks ( please check
gentamicin peak and trough levels ).
5. Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily.
6. Lopressor 50 mg PO t.i.d. Hold for systolic blood pressure
less than 110 and heart rate less than 55.
7. Senna tablets 2 tablets PO b.i.d.
8. Multivitamin therapeutic with minerals , 1 tab PO daily.
9. Vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 12 hours x6 weeks.
10. Coumadin 7.5 mg PO q.p.m. with a target INR of 2 to 3 for
atrial fibrillation chronically.
11. Esomeprazole 40 mg PO daily.
12. Oxycodone 5-10 mg PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain.
PLAN: The patient will be transferred to Potan Community Hospital
??_____??. He has a right antecubital PICC line in place which
will be flushed per protocol. He will require intravenous
antibiotics for six weeks&apos; time and during this time will require
at least weekly lab draws with CBC with diff , BUN and creatinine.
He will be followed by Dr. Bees from Infectious Disease at
Fieldbash Perek Medical Center . He was followed by Dr. Odermott from Infectious
Disease during his hospitalization at Itorschild Brookrisionxas Hospital And Health Center Mr. Phillippe will require a hearing test while at
Ter Medical Center due to his longterm gentamicin treatment. He
will require rehab services for mobilization , weightbearing as
tolerated , with free range of motion and no restrictions for both
lower and the right upper extremity. He will remain in his
Orthoplast splint with b.i.d. dressing changes to the dorsal
wrist incision. Mr. Groat will follow up with Dr. Gaston Weisse
from Ba Medical Center Orthopedics on 7/25 at 9:00 and
with the Hand Service at Cet Ene Memorial Hospital on 5/9 at
9:15. He will also follow up with Dr. Digmann from Thma Hospital Gastroenterology for a colonoscopy on 10/17/05 at

Discharge Date: 3/2/1995
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: PNEUMONIA , LEFT UPPER LOBE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
URINARY INCONTINENCE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nittinger is a 70-year-old male
with hypertension , coronary artery
disease , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , and a
75-pack-year history of tobacco use , who presented on 7/20 at the
Los Hospital with a four-day history of subjective fever
and nonproductive cough. The patient denied shortness of breath ,
chest pain , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He
reported perfuse sweating , usually associated with fever , but
denied history of exposure to tuberculosis or history of
tuberculosis. The patient denied sick contacts and reported having
had an influenza vaccine during this past winter as well as having
a Pneumovax in the past. The patient also reported feeling
fatigued about one week prior to admission and , on the night of
admission , felt his legs collapse under him secondary to weakness.
He denied head trauma. He said he fell on his outstretched arm.
He has no history of seizure disorder and was fully conscious
throughout the event. He called his daughter who brought him to
the Collti Eshard Emergency Room. The patient was seen there and
evaluated , and he was transferred to the Napin Hospital in the early morning hours of 6/15/95 as he is a Pagham patient.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Angina ( none in the past several months ).
Coronary artery disease. Status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2/10 at which
time a 99% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending was
noted , which was 30% after PTCA. Status post PTCA in 1/29 , again
with 99% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending , which
was 30% after PTCA. Status post PTCA in 2/18 , again with 99%
occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending , which was 30%
after PTCA; there was a small complication in which a focal
dissection of the proximal left anterior descending was noted..
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Angioplasty as above.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. Lopressor
50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Cardizem-SR 120 mg.
b.i.d. Coumadin 2.5 mg. alternating with 3 mg. p.o. q. day.
Lovastatin 20 mg. q. day. Glyburide 5 mg. q. day.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for cardiac disease. His father had lung
cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with wife and daughter.
He has a 75-pack-year history of tobacco use. He
reportedly was smoking until two weeks prior to the onset of
illness. He denies any use of alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs at the Sno Valley Hospital Center
Emergency Room revealed temperature 102 ,
respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 160/78. At the Delf11 Valley Medical Center Emergency Room , temperature was 100.7 , heart rate
96 , O2 saturations 95% on room air , blood pressure 128/80 ,
respiratory rate 20. This was a well-developed , well-nourished ,
white male who was somnolent but easily arousable. He was very
diaphoretic in the Emergency Room. Neck was supple with full range
of motion and no lymphadenopathy. The JVP was flat. Lungs
revealed anterior bronchial breath sounds in the left upper lung
field. Lungs were clear to auscultation posteriorly.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with
occasional premature beats. An S1 and S2 were heard. There were
no no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Bowel sounds were present. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly was
noted. On rectal exam , he had heme-negative , brown stool , and he
had a normal tone; this was per the Emergency Room staff.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. Neurologic
exam revealed cranial nerves III through XII were intact. He was
alert and oriented x three. Motor and sensory exam revealed 5/5
bilaterally. Reflexes were 0 to 1+ bilaterally and symmetrically.
Toes were downgoing. He had normal bulk and tone throughout.
X-RAY: Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe infiltrate , and this
was per the Ontmang Hospital . A repeat chest x-ray
here on 5/25/95 again showed extensive left upper lobe pneumonia.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM: The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus
rhythm at 89 with occasional premature
ventricular contractions. He had a Q-wave inversion in lead 3 and
AVF , biphasic V3.
LABORATORY DATA: Fluid balance panel revealed sodium 131 ,
potassium 3.4 , BUN and creatinine 23 and 1.4 ,
chloride and bicarb 98 and 23 , glucose 194. His LDH was elevated
slightly at 259. His other liver function tests were within normal
limits. His total protein was 5.7 , albumin 3.0. His hemoglobin
and hematocrit were 14.4 and 43.3 , respectively. White blood cell
count was 12 , 100 with a differential of 84% polys , 5% bands , 6%
lymphs , and 2% monos. Platelet count was 188 , 000. His urinalysis
was significant for white blood cells and red blood cells that were
too numerous to count. He had 3+ bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
PROBLEM #1: PNEUMONIA , LEFT UPPER LOBE. The patient received 1 g.
of Cefuroxime at the Sontro Cle Healthcare and was
transferred to the Termmette Medical Center where Cefotaxime
1 g. eight hours was begun. The patient continued to spike
temperatures on hospital days #1 and #2 , although blood and urine
cultures remained negative. On hospital day #3 , Erythromycin was
added to his antibiotic regimen as the patient continued to spike
temperatures. The following day , the patient defervesced and
remained afebrile throughout the hospital course. As mentioned
earlier , a repeat chest x-ray here again showed extensive left
upper lobe pneumonia. Clinically , the findings from the physical
exam showed a resolution of the bronchial breath sounds. On the
day of discharge , the patient&apos;s lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The patient had been afebrile for four days and had
been on Erythromycin orally for two days. The intravenous
Cefotaxime was also discontinued two days prior to discharge at
which point the intravenous Erythromycin was changed to orally at
500 mg. q.i.d. The patient was instructed that he should avoid the
use of tobacco as this would increase his likelihood of
redeveloping pneumonia as well as increase his likelihood of
worsening cardiac disease. A sputum sample was induced , and it was
sent for routine culture and AFB culture and smear. The cultures
were negative , and the AFB smear was negative for mycobacteria.
The cultures were negative on discharge.
PROBLEM #2: URINARY TRACT INFECTION. The patient was treated
with Cefotaxime which was also used for treatment of
his pneumonia. He was noted to have urinary incontinence , and by
report , the incontinence had begun approximately four or five days
prior to admission. It was felt that the incontinence might be
secondary to his ongoing infection. A repeat urinalysis was sent
approximately four days after admission and showed 1 to 2 white
blood cells and 0 bacteria. The patient , at that point , no longer
was having urinary incontinence; however , he was noted to have a
large postvoid residual of 300 cc. It was felt that this might be
related in part to mild benign prostatic hypertrophy. Dr. Nydam ,
his primary care physician , is aware and will pursue further
work-up as necessary.
PROBLEM #3: ATAXIA. The patient was noted by the family members
to be somewhat ataxic at home. The onset of this
ataxia was in relation to his current illness; however , given the
fact that he was on Coumadin , and due to the fact that he had
sustained a fall in the evening of admission , a CT scan was
performed to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CT scan was
negative for hemorrhage and showed age-appropriate atrophy. A
Neurology consult was also requested , and recommendations for the
CT scan , as already discussed , were made. In addition , they
recommended that we check an RPR , B12 , folate , and TSH. The
results are as follows: RPR was nonreactive. The first draw of
B12 was 233 , which is slightly low normal. A repeat B12 was 564 ,
which is within normal limits. His folate was normal at 4.9. His
TSH was slightly low at 0.44. A Physical Therapy consult was also
obtained to assist the patient with exercises to improve his
strength. By discharge , the patient was able to ambulate without
difficulty. He was having no ataxia , whatsoever. We feel , in
part , that some of this ataxia may have been related to generalized
weakness that was associated with his current illness.
PROBLEM #4: DIABETES MELLITUS. On admission , the patient&apos;s
glucose was 194. Due to his oral intake , we elected
to hold his Glyburide and to give him insulin subcu. on a sliding
scale basis as needed. By hospital day #4 , the patient&apos;s p.o.
intake had improved , and we resumed Glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. day
with sliding scale p.r.n. We continued Accucheks on a b.i.d.
basis. His glucose tended to run in the low 200s. His glucose
will need to be followed as an outpatient , and perhaps one might
consider a glucometer for him at home to ensure that he has good
glucose control.
PROBLEM #5: HEMATOLOGIC. The patient was admitted on Coumadin ,
which he takes as follows: 2.5 mg. alternating with
3 mg. On admission , his INR was 1.8. His INR was rechecked on
6/2/95 and was noted to be 4.8. His Coumadin was held for a couple
of days , and his INR was rechecked on the day of discharge; it was
2.4 on the day of discharge. We feel that the elevation in his INR
was probably related to his being on antibiotics. I have mentioned
this to his primary care doctor , Dr. Reimer He will follow up on
his clinic visit on Monday , 7/22/95.
LABORATORY PENDING ON DISCHARGE: Legionella antigen , obtained on
10/2/95. Repeat stool for
Clostridium difficile toxin on 1/5/95 ; however , the patient&apos;s
diarrhea has diminished , and we do not think that this is related
to Clostridium difficile.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg. p.o. q. day. Cardizem-SR
120 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Erythromycin 500 mg.
p.o. q.i.d. x eight days. Glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. day. Lovastatin
20 mg. p.o. q. day. Coumadin 2 mg. p.o. q. day. Nitroglycerin 0.4
mg. tablets sublingual q. five minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain;
the patient is to notify the M.D. if the pain fails to resolve
after three tablets or if he should become light-headed while
taking those tablets.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Elvis Alcantas in
clinic on Monday , 7/22/95.

alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100 degrees , respiratory rate
16 , heart rate 100 , blood pressure 90/58.
HEENT exam was unremarkable. Lungs were clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular: Tachycardic; normal S1 and S2; no murmurs.
Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended.
Extremities: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. His fourth toe was
amputated.
LABS: White count 6.7 , hematocrit 48.6 , BUN 35 , creatinine 1 ,
liver function tests within normal limits , troponin 0.0 , CPK
660 with an MB of 3.9. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no
ischemia. Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Short
Stay Unit. He underwent a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol with negative serial CPKs. Exercise test was
done prior to discharge and was negative.
The patient also had evidence of hypovolemia with his hypotension
and tachycardia and poor p.o. intake for several days. He was
hydrated overnight and felt improved the following day. His
tachycardia and hypotension resolved with hydration.
Also , to evaluate his elevated CPKs , a TSH was checked and is
pending at the time of discharge. Urinalysis also checked in the
Short Stay Unit was negative. After his exercise test , the patient
was discharged to home on his usual medications which include NPH
12 units q.p.m. and insulin 70/30 , 45 units q.a.m. The patient

non-adherence at times due to depression and not re-filling meds;
includes no lasix x3+ weeks. Seen by PCP w/ SaO2 noted to be 91% on RA
( on home O2 prior but not currently for e/o PNA ) -&gt; admitted.
Overall , evaluated for dyspnea w/ neck/chest discomfort &amp; hyoxemia of
unclear etiology. Performed ABG to confirm hypoxemia: on 3L NC
7.45/45/79 ( Aa gradient elevated at approximately 158 ).
- Suspected DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION in context of ischemic heart dz/HTN

ADDENDUM
Please note this is an addendum to the previously dictated
discharge summary #6047544.
INTERIM HISTORY: In the interim , since the previously dictated
discharge summary , the patient has continued to progress from a
cardiac standpoint.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course by system from 10/25/05
through the date of discharge is as follows:
1. Ischemia: The patient had continued to remain stable from an
ischemia standpoint. He continues on aspirin and statin. A
beta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated
to a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has not
been started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated
creatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chest
pain.
2. Pump: The patient&apos;s congestive heart failure regimen was
titrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. and
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He was
restarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as
well as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn
followed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the
time of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by the
CHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark&apos;s Medical Center . At the time of
discharge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia with
estimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.
3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with a
block. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at the
time of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapid
dysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his
medication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mg
p.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrial
clot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on a
heparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after a
substantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service
and the patient&apos;s outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the
risks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of
significant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of
thromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot
and thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin
anticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at full
doses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluated
as an outpatient based on the patient&apos;s follow-up as deemed
appropriate by his outpatient providers.
4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus
regimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units
q.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient&apos;s
insulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly
oral diabetes medications restarted.
5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonary
with good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and with
ambulation.
6. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine on the day prior to
discharge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.
Renal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not been
restarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient
as his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes were
monitored and repleted aggressively.
7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to
anticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He was
started on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also had
decreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and
thus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the time
of the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient&apos;s
outpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In the
meantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , the
decision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the
patient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin
anticoagulation.
8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patient
complained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the
patient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light of
the patient&apos;s known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial
clot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of
acute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multiple
old infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , left
occipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,
however , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internal
carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and
there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus
stenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotid
endarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid
stenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.
It was felt that because the patient would decline any
intervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute
renal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.
The patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on
several occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are
pending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of

stent with severe three-vessel
coronary artery disease. Patient began having substernal chest
pain and shortness of breath on exertion six months ago. At that
time , he underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed 90% RCA ,
60% LAD , and 40% diagonal 1. Stenting and PTCA were performed to
the right coronary artery , with resolution of symptoms; however ,
three months after the stent , they gradually returned. He
currently complains of dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath
with two flights of stairs occurring about three times a week.
Cardiac catheterization revealed three-vessel coronary artery
disease. Angioplasty was attempted to the restenosis and stent of
RCA without success.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient underwent echocardiography on 11/15/2002 ,
which revealed an ejection fraction of 55% , some
regional wall motion abnormalities in basal anterior septum and
basal posterior appearing slightly hypokinetic. Aortic valve is
slightly thickened , mitral valve with trace MR , tricuspid valve
with mild TR. Other findings: Enlarged left atrium. Patient was
taken to the operating room on 10/24/2002 and underwent CABG x 4 ,
with LIMA to LAD , SVG to D-1 , left radial to OM-2 , and SVG-2 to
PDA. He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following surgery in
stable condition on 2 mcg of epinephrine and 5 of Levophed.
Amlodipine was started as an antispasmodic for his radial artery.
Diabetes Management Service and cardiology followed him in the
postoperative period. Following chest tube removal , he was found

Discharge Date: 12/10/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RECURRENT LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP
VENOUS THROMBOSES ( DVT&apos;S )
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA
2 ) RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE
3 ) HYPERTENSION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50 year old Black female with
a significant past medical history for
multiple DVT&apos;s , who came in here complaining of increased left
lower extremity swelling and pain. The patient has a long history
of left lower extremity DVT&apos;s. She had her first DVT approximately
ten years ago. She has had approximately one to two DVTs per year
thereafter. According to her report , the DVTs have always been in
the left lower extremity. Also , her record shows that she has only
had DVTs in her left lower extremity. The longest duration of symptoms from a
DVT was approximately for one to two years. She has had
multiple other episodes of left lower extremity swelling and pain. The
patient states that she would not always go to the hospital for
treatment , but instead would self treat herself by raising her leg
when immobile. Nonetheless , she has had approximately four DVTs in
the past year. Her last two admissions for DVTs were as follows:
From 3/6 to 5/1/95 she had left popliteal and greater saphenous
DVTs by lower extremity non invasive testing. She was discharged at
that time but did not fill her Coumadin prescription. She was then
readmitted on 3/23/95 and discharged on 1/1/95 with a left common
femoral DVT by lower extremity non invasive testing.
Since the last admission , the patient adamantly states that she was
very compliant to Coumadin therapy. She states that she has had
increased pain and swelling in the left lower extremity. She also
states that she has been relatively active at home ( she does
gardening , cleans the house , goes for walks ). When not active , the
patient states that she elevates her legs. Despite all of this ,
the patient has noted gradual increase of left lower extremity
swelling and pain which has became intolerable on the day of
presentation.
DVT RISK FACTORS: No trauma to the lower extremities , no prior
surgery to the onset of DVT. No known
hypocoagulable state. No oral contraceptives used. No hormone
replacement therapy. No significant immobilization. The patient is
obese , she has had three miscarriages and she smokes. Also of note
the patient had a factor V level , which was normal. No other
studies have been done by patient report or discharge report.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies any fevers , chills , sweats ,
nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , bright red blood
per rectum , melena , chest pain , pleuritic chest pain , chest
pressure , cough , or dysuria. However , the patient has had a
significant toothaches bilaterally for the past two weeks. Also , of
particular note , the patient gives a history of sudden onset of
shortness of breath , lasting for approximately 30 minutes or so ,
almost every evening. She states that the shortness of breath is
relieved with oxygen therapy , as she has at home. She never has
pleuritic chest pain or cough with these episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Recurrent DVTs x 10 years; 2 ) obesity and
obstructive sleep apnea; 3 ) restrictive lung
disease; 4 ) hypertension; 5 ) atypical chest pain; 6 ) GERD; 7 )
depression; 8 ) status post herniorrhaphy in September of 1994.
PFTs from September of 1994 show an FVC of 1.85 , which is 56%
predicted. FEV-1 of 1.61 , which is 59% predicted. MVC/FEV-1 ratio
of 107% predicted. DLCO corrected 61%. TLC of 3.32 , which is 64% predicted.
ECHO results from 1994 show an ejection fraction of 55% , with a
normal right ventricular function and size.
The patient is on home 02 , approximately two to three liters by
nasal cannula. Her baseline dyspnea on exertion is approximately
five steps or approximately 1/4 block , but always without chest
pain or substernal chest pressure.
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: She is G VIII , P V with three mis-
carriages in the first trimester.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Coumadin , 7.5 mg q day; 2 ) Zoloft ,
60 mg q day; 3 ) Lasix , 20 mg q day; 4 )
Axid , 150 mg b.i.d.
TOBACCO: 30 years x one half pack per day; currently smoking.
ALCOHOL: No alcohol use.
IVDU: Cocaine , no use.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a positive family history for cancer. Her
mother had cancer and died at a young age but she
did not know her mother. Her grandmother had skin cancer. There is
no diabetes mellitus; coronary artery disease , bleeding or clotting
problems or lung problems in her family.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is from Ellno Rd and
was raised by her grandmother. She has four living
children and one child who recently passed away. She has been
depressed after the death of her last child. She is now living
with her son in Barin Ln , I Ville Joseri , Hawaii
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is a very obese , black female in no
apparent distress. She was not tachypneic.
Temperature 97.3 , blood pressure 112/74 , pulse 64 , respiratory rate
16. Oxygen saturation of 88% on room air , which increased to 93%
on two liters nasal cannula. Skin was warm and dry. There were no
rashes , bruising or petechiae noted. HEENT - pupils equally round
and reactive to light and accommodation. EOMI. Sclera anicteric.
Neck supple with a full range of motion , no lymphadenopathy , no
JVD; oropharynx moist and pink. Tongue midline with a mottled
pigmentation. Tonsils bilaterally enlarged with a small airway
noted. The left upper two molars were tender to minimal palpation.
The right upper molar was also tender. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally but decreased breath sounds in the bases. Heart -
regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft , non tender , obese , positive bowel sounds , negative
organomegaly; vertical midline scar , no CVAT. Rectal examination
was hemenegative. Extremities - there was significant left lower
extremity swelling noted up to the thigh with positive pitting
edema to the calf. There was also tenderness on the left inner
thigh anteriorly. There was also marked tenderness on the left
calf. There was no erythema. The left calf measured 41.5 cm.
There was an impressive homan&apos;s sign. The right lower extremity
had minimal swelling noted without tenderness , erythema or warmth.
The right calf measured 36.0 cm. Neuro exam non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Notable for a Bicarbonate of 34 , hematocrit of
48.2 , and RDW of 17.4 and MCV of 75.4; white
blood cell count of 4.9 with a normal differential. Her PTT was
21.6 , INR of 3.2 , PTT of 45.0. Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary
edema or pneumonia. There was bibasilar atelectasis , which was not
changed from prior x-ray. LIMA showed left common femoral vein
DVT , left popliteal vein DVT and distal left saphenous vein DVT.
VQ scan was read as low probability , which was comparable to her
previous VQ scan in September of 1995 , which was low probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was evaluated for recurrent DVT and
possible pulmonary embolus and treated with intravenous
heparin. We had a low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolus and the VQ scan
was also low probability. The patient was seen by the cardiology service to
evaluate if the patient was a candidate for IVC filter placement.
Cardiology felt that the patient was not at risk for pulmonary
embolus and that her recurrent DVTs were of a more result of non
compliance and/or never completing a full course of anticoagulation
therapy. Thus , the plan was to continue to anticoagulate the
patient and follow her as an outpatient. However , the patient
continued to have tooth pain and was seen by the dental service. On
1/17/95 , she had two molars extracted , one on each side of the
upper dentition. Her dental surgery was uncomplicated. After
surgery , she was continued on Heparin and anticoagulated with
Coumadin. The patient continued to do well. However , the patient&apos;s
hospital course was notable for multiple episodes of sudden
shortness of breath , usually occurring during the evening. The
shortness of breath would come on suddenly , sometimes when she was
asleep and sometimes when she was awake. The shortness of breath
would last for approximately 30 minutes or so and would be relieved
with oxygen therapy by nasal cannula. The patient states that this
history of sudden shortness of breath is usual for her and has
occurred for several months. There were no associated symptoms of
fevers , chills , sweats , pleuritic chest pain , chest pressure ,
palpitations or cough. We did not suspect that she was having
multiple PE&apos;s. The patient was sent home with an INR of 3.2.
In any case , the patient was slow to respond while in house to
anticoagulation with Warfarin. She required approximately six days
of Warfarin at the following doses - 12.5 , 9/14 7.5 and 10 mg of
Coumadin before obtaining an INR greater than 3.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Lasix , 20 mg q day; 2 ) Nifedipine XL , 30
mg q day; 3 ) Zoloft , 50 mg q d; 4 ) Axid ,
150 mg b.i.d.; 5 ) Coumadin , 7.5 mg alternating with 10 mg P O q
day.
FOLLOW UP: The patient is scheduled to have a follow up
appointment with Dr. Delbo on 7/25/95 at 9:40 AM. She is to
have VNA service to her home to check her INR level tomorrow. Her
PT/PTT results will be reported to Jae Hobbie , a nurse
practitioner at the Sa More Memorial Hospital BRY CENTER Clinic.

Discharge Date: 10/24/1992
HISTORY: The patient is a 79-year-old black
female with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension and peripheral vascular disease who presented to the
Bistin Wester Hospital emergency room brought in by the EMTs for
unresponsiveness at home.
Cardiac risk factors were positive for diabetes , hypertension ,
questionable family history and question of a prior MA. She was
relatively well with diabetes and hypertension at her baseline
until approximately 8 of September when she had a left common femoral
angioplasty at Sideplea Memorial Hospital .
In 27 of May , she had a left fem/pop for vascular insufficiency , and
her hospitalization at that time was complicated by some mental
status changes and a fever of unknown etiology.
In 7 of March , she presented to NORSTOOKTRINA HOP UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH with an upper respiratory infec-
tion and received pneumovax. In 28 of February , she was recurrently seen
in DAUTE ONTKEEAR MEDICAL CENTER for coughs and colds. In 25 of October , she had a Landutchess Hospital admission for three days of cough , purulent sputum and
shortness of breath.
On admission , she was on her insulin and inhalers. She was
treated with intravenous Cefotetan and IV steroids for reactive
airways disease. The patient improved slowly and steadily on a
taper.
On 5 of May , the patient was complaining of increasing lethargy , a
sick feeling , was cold and clammy and called her medical doctor.
Approximately 15 minutes later , the patient was noted by her
family to be unresponsive and EMTs were called. The patient was
found to be hypotensive , diahporetic and nonverbal with a heart
rate in the 20s and EKG that was consistent with complete heart
block.
She was intubated , treated with Atropine in the field and brought
to the Waltwhidverstiicsonacot Medical Center emergency room. In the emergency
room , her heart rate was noted to be 20. She appeared to be in
sinus arrest with a ventricular escaped rhythm. An external
pacer was placed. She was paced at 80 , had an increase in her
blood pressure , was given calcium and resuscitated with fluids.
A transvenous pacemaker was placed and captured effectively.
LABORATORY DATA: ing intubated. Her bicarb was eight on
admission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was
28. She was given oriing intubated. Her bicarb was eight on
admission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was
28. She was given oriing intubated. Her bicarb was eight on
admission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was
28. She was given oriing intubated. Her bicarb was eight on
admission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was
28. She was given originally , in the emergency room , IV insulin
as well and treated with antibiotics including Ceftriaxone ,
Vancomycin and Gentamicin and transferred to the cardiac care
unit because there were no NICU beds available. Allergies: No
known allergies. She does not smoke or drink. She is currently
living with her daughter , one of 11 children. She has 66 grand-
children and 30 great grandchildren. Medications on admission
included Verapamil 40 q. day; insulin 30 units NPH a day;
Captopril 25 t.i.d.; Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.; and
Ventolin and Atrovent inhalers.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , diabetes ,
multiple rotator cuff injuries in the
past , the femoral and popliteal bypass procedure as noted above
and noted to have an increased globulin in the past.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In the unit , she had IV insulin started
for presumed diabetic ketoacidosis. The
sinus arrest was presumed to be metabolic in origin due to her
severe acidosis hyperkalemia secondary to her diabetic ketoaci-
dosis. In addition , she had been on high dose Verapamil with
some question of whether or not this was suppressing her sinus
node.
She was maintained on IV insulin for approximately two days but
had a persistent metabolic acidosis. Because of some abdominal
tenderness which was hard to gauge given her decreased mental
status while she was intubated , she underwent an abdominal CT
that was unremarkable , although very mild pancreatitis was noted.
She had a concomitant rise in her amylase and lipase to approxi-
mately 270 and 1 , 290 respectively.
Her LFTs showed a picture consistent with shock liver with her
transaminases going up to approximately 1 , 000-2 , 000 range and the
LDH in the 2 , 000-3 , 000 range. It resolved over time as her blood
pressure returned to normal. Her antibiotics were changed to
Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for concern of an abdominal
source despite the negative CT , and her low grade fevers per-
sisted for a few days but then she defervesced.
On 3 of November , she was transferred to the floor after having received
approximately five days of intravenous insulin and a resolution
of her hyperglycemia and ketosis.
Her hospital course on the floor was notable for a titration of
her insulin dose. Of note , her insulin dose was as high as
approximately 30-35 units of NPH q. day in a setting of having
received steroids initially on admission and they were continued.
Her steroids were weaned rapidly and , once steroids were stopped
her insulin requirement decreased markedly and she was only on 20
units of NPH a day now.
Of note , she had two episodes of hypoglycemia in the morning with
blood sugars in the 20-30 range , one of which was asymptomatic
but one of which was associated with some shaking that responded
promptly to administration of juice.
From an infectious disease standpoint , she had no obvious source
for any of her fevers , and she defervesced. There was some ques-
tion of aspiration surrounding her original intubation , so she
was maintained on approximately seven days of antibiotics and
then these were stopped. She was watched , and she remained
afebrile throughout her hospitalization.
One day prior to discharge , she complained of some left gum pain.
Exam showed a very mild swelling and some focal tenderness but
was unremarkable. Because of this , she was started on Peni-
cillin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. which will be continued for seven days.
From a renal standpoint , her baseline creatinine was 1.3 to 1.5
range and it bumped to approximately 3.0 during hospitalization.
She was being discharged with her creatinine of approximately
1.7. Her urine output had been excellent.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , within three or four days of
her admission , her sinus arrest resolved in a setting of correc-
tion of her metabolic derangement. Her pacemaker was removed ,
and she had no further cardiac event.
She was being discharged today in stable condition to the Beywell Hospital with the following discharge medications:
Nifedipine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day; Pepcid
20 mg p.o. q. day; Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Clonidine 0.1 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q. day; Albuterol 0.5 cc and
2.5 cc normal saline q. three to four hours p.r.n.; insulin NPH
20 units subcutaneous q.a.m.; Penicillin B 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
times one week; Peridex swish and swallow q.i.d.; and 5 , 000 units
of subcutaneous heparin b.i.d. as long as she remains somewhat
inactive. She takes an 1 , 800 kilocalorie ADA diet and low-salt
and low-cholesterol diet as well.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Diabetic ketoacidosis.
2. Sinus arrest.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hypertension.

The patient received care on the Stockvi
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Dilated cardiomyopathy with associated
problems of hypertension and asthma.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 53 year old female with hypertension x
eight years , who presents with increased dyspnea
on exertion and admitted for left and right heart catheterization ,
and to optimize blood pressure control.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old Afro-American
female , first diagnosed with
hypertension in 1987. She presented to the Emergency Room in 1987
with acute atypical chest pain , and was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. ETT in 1987 demonstrated chest pain during exercise
and suggestive ST T wave changes in the inferolateral leads during
exercise. The patient was discharged from the hospital , and did
relatively well with intermittent chest pain on exertion.
Exercise tolerance test in 1991 demonstrated consistent , but not
diagnostic of ischemia. No chest pain. Echocardiogram in 1992
demonstrated inferior , posterior , and apical hyperkinesis , low to
normal global pattern of systolic contractile function , and a
celionous redundancy of the mitral anterior leaflet , with only
trace mitral regurgitation.
Since 1992 , the patient has developed severe shortness of breath
with positive chest discomfort of pin and needles in the left
chest , which radiates down her left arm. She notes positive
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with the need of sleeping elevated at
45 degrees at some times.
Echocardiogram in 1994 demonstrated moderately dilated left
ventricle with severely depressed systolic function. Ejection
fraction equals 26%. There was 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild
left atrial enlargement also noted. Mild tricuspid regurgitation
with pulmonary artery pressure estimated at approximately 25.
Due to her hypertension and decreased left ventricular function ,
the patient presents to the Ton Medical Center for a left
and right side catheterization , and also for monitoring of her
blood pressure. Her blood pressure ranged , as an outpatient ,
between 170 to 180/100 to 110.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. As above.
2. Asthma.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Beclovent 4 puffs b.i.d.
2. Enalapril 4 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
HABITS: The patient smokes one-half per day to one pack per day
for the last twenty-five years. Alcohol , occasional.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s mother died in her sleep at age 50
of unknown reasons. Her father died due to a
motor vehicle accident. Two brothers and one sister all died at
age 30 to 40 , the patient does not know cause.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has not worked since 1995 due to what
she states as shortness of breath and chest pain.
She has three daughters , all in good health , and four
grandchildren.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , this is a 53 year
old female , Afro-American , in no apparent
distress. Vital signs: Temperature 97.6 , blood pressure 134/72
after Hydralazine , heart rate 75 , respiratory rate of 12. HEENT
examination: Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils are equal ,
round , reactive to light. Nasal oral pharynx had no discharge , and
was clear with no exudates. Neck: No adenopathy , no jugular
venous distention , no thyromegaly. Carotids are 2+ with no bruits.
Lungs revealed diffuse expiratory wheezes , prolonged expiratory
phase , no rhonchi or rales. Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , positive S4 , with a 2/6 systolic
murmur at the apex. The abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , with no obvious hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities
revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , and no bruits. Pulses
were 2+ throughout. Neurological examination: Alert and oriented
x three , nonfocal examination.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs upon admission revealed an SMA-7 of
143 , 4.1 , 102 , 28 , 20 , 1.2 , and 93. CBC
of 6.3 , 46.1 , and 280. PT and PTT of 12.5 and 28.4. ALT of 14 ,
AST of 19 , LDH of 197 , alkaline phosphatase of 77 , total bilirubin
of .3 , total protein of 7.9 , albumin of 4.2. Globulins of 3.7 ,
calcium of 9.4 , phosphate of 4.4 , cholesterol of 210 , and
triglyceride of 67.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
hospital day number one which demonstrated no
coronary artery disease disease , right atrium pressure of 12 , PA
pressure of 56/32 with a mean of 38 and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 20. Cardiac output was 5.1 , SVR of 1459 , and PVR of
282. The patient was then admitted to the Floor for workup of her
hypertension. Urine metanephrine and urine VMA were sent. The
patient&apos;s Enalapril was discontinued in order to perform the
Captopril Renogram Test. The patient was started on Diltiazem 180
mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg b.i.d. , and Hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d.
The patient&apos;s blood pressure , on hospital day number three , was
130/70 and well-controlled. Her heart rate was 70 to 80. On
hospital day number four , the patient underwent a Captopril
Renogram Test which was negative for renal artery stenosis. Other
hypertension workup Epinephrine , Dopamine , Metanephrine , VMA and
ANA are still pending.
The patient was discharged home on hospital day number five , with
blood pressure being well-controlled throughout her hospital visit
in the 130/70&apos;s.
The patient&apos;s hypertension control was attributed to the fact that
number one , she stopped smoking during her hospital stay; two , she
was inactive and was on bed rest; and three , the possibility of
strict compliance with medications while in the hospital.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Diltiazem 180 mg po q.d.
2. Enalapril 10 mg po q.d.
3. Lasix 80 mg po b.i.d.

ATTENDING: LEGGET , BASIL MALCOM MD
Admitted 10/18/05 to Dr. Alan Smaniotto
ADMISSION CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor p.o. intake and failure to
thrive.
HPI: This 77-year-old female first noted dysphagia beginning in
approximately October 2005. Since then it has persisted and
worsened , and she was seen by a primary care physician. Initial
endoscopy was performed , which was suspicious for malignancy ,
however , the patient was on Coumadin and no biopsy was obtained
at that time. She underwent a repeat upper endoscopy on August ,
2005 at the Arma Healthcare Health The EGD revealed that Ms. Hinrichsen
had Barrett&apos;s esophagus as well as a nodule on the distal
esophagus. No evidence of gastritis. A biopsy of the nodule
revealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma at 35 cm.
It appeared to be rising in association with Barrett&apos;s
esophagitis. She also has a history of ischemic myopathy with an
LVEF of approximately 20% and CAD with a history of bypass graft
in 1992 and a biventricular ICD placed in October 2004. She
underwent an endoscopy on September , 2005 , an EUS revealed that she
had an intramural lesion in the distal esophagus measuring 2 cm
in diameter invading into the muscularis propria , therefore she
was staged and having T3 , N0 , MX , and tumor by EUS. She was seen
at Toards Health in mid July by both Dr. Tyrell Aningalan
from Medial Oncology and Dr. Wahlen from Radiation Oncology. It was
felt that she was a reasonable candidate for consideration of
chemoradiation. She therefore began her chemoradiation and
radiotherapy , chemotherapy including Taxol and cisplatin.
Approximately 1 week prior to admission on February , 2005 ,
unfortunately , she reports over the course of the past week , she
has had increasing dysphagia to the point where she is having
trouble swallowing liquids. She presented for her routine
radiation therapy the day prior to admission , with complaints of
severe lightheadedness and difficulty getting off the radiation
table. She was taken to the ED , where she was found to be
dehydrated and weak. She had some chills , but no fever , no
hemoptysis or diarrhea. She has had very poor p.o. intake and
she notes some weight loss.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CAD , status post CABG , 5 vessel in 1995.

8. A-fib on Coumadin.
9. Esophageal cancer status post chemo on XRT.
10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: Codeine causes GI upset , morphine and Demerol caused
GI upset , amoxicillin/clavulanic acid caused GI upset , azelastine
causes stinging , and amiodarone causes cold sweats.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission were Lopressor 50
b.i.d. , Diovan 80 , digoxin 0.125 mg five days a week , Synthroid
0.125 mg , Imdur 30 daily , Lasix 80 daily , Prevacid 30 daily ,
multivitamin , Coumadin 3 mg nightly , and Zocor 5 every other day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with her
husband. She is a homemaker. She does not smoke. She does not
drink except for occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a father with melanoma , and a mother
with an MI at the age of 59.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM: She had no abdominal pain , no chest pain , no
shortness of breath , no headache , and no joint pain.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission ,
VITAL SIGNS: Her temp was 97.4 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 87/56 ,
respiratory rate 20 , saturating 98% on room air.
GENERAL: She was an alert , oriented , cooperative female , who was
resting comfortably.
HEENT: Her mucous membranes were dry , oropharynx clear. Pupils
were equal , round and reactive to right. Extraocular motions
intact.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no crackles or
wheezes.
NECK: There is JVP at 7 cm , low lymphadenopathy. Her neck was
supple.
CARDIOVASCULAR: She was irregularly regular with a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur loudest at the apex.
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with positive bowel
sounds. Her extremities had trace edema with no bruising.
LABORATORY DATA: Her admission labs were notable for potassium
of 2.9 , BUN of 37 and creatinine of 1.6. Her LFTs and CBC were
within normal limits. Her INR on admission was 2.7. Her albumin
was 3.7 , mag 1.5. Her UA was negative. Her EKG showed a right
bundle branch block with A-fib , A-flutter with occasional paced
beats from her pacer. Her chest x-ray was clear.
ASSESSMENT: This 77-year-old female with a history of CAD , CHF
and esophageal cancer presenting with lightheadedness , however ,
having nausea and vomiting , most likely her symptoms are due to
dehydration. Unlikely a cardiac cause given no chest pain , no
palpitation , and obviously decreased p.o.
PLAN:
1. Lightheadedness: Poor p.o. intake and dehydration.
Nutrition was consulted to evaluate regarding the possible stent
in esophagus. She will be treated with gentle hydration
overnight , measure orthostatics , holding Lasix.
2. Cardiovascular: History of CHF with an EF of 20% , checking
BNP and monitor on tele for arrhythmia , continue digoxin , Diovan ,
Lopressor , continue Imdur , continue Lasix while hydrating.
3. Esophageal Cancer: Got XRT. On the day of admission , she
will continue XRT.
4. Nausea: Rx for Zofran and replete potassium.
5. Hypothyroidism: Continue Synthroid.
6. GERD: Continue Prevacid.
7. A-fib: Continue Coumadin.
8. Hyperlipidemia: Continue Zocor.
9. FEN: Replete electrolytes p.r.n. , diabetic diet , and
multivitamin.
10. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin and Prevacid.
11. Full code.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lightheadedness: It was felt that all of her lightheadedness
was most likely due to dehydration. Her lightheadedness improved
with hydration , it was most likely due to poor p.o. intake.
Nutrition evaluated her and suggested high calorie supplements ,
however , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take good
p.o. GI was consulted regarding possible stenting of her
esophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion that
could potentially be causing this nausea. She was also ordered
for a barium swallow. On the barium swallow , there was a strict
stenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any food
to pass through. An EGD was performed , which showed some food
about a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. Based upon
this it was felt that she would benefit from a G-tube.
Interventional radiology was consulted and placed a G-tube
without complication. Tube feeds were begun and she tolerated
them well without complication. She has been continued on tube
feeds and is currently at goal of 360 cc four times a day , with a
scoop of promod , these will be continued upon discharge.
2. TIA/CVA: On the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that she
had decreased ability to move the left side of her body. Based
upon this , a STAT CT and CTA was performed. The CT showed no
bleeding , and during the CT scan , she regained all function in
the left side , however , the CTA did note a large friable clot
within her right ICA. Based upon her high level of heart disease
and high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt that
she would be a stent candidate at that time. She was continued
on Lovenox therapy with Coumadin with the plan to discharge her
on medical management for this TIA. However , on the morning of
8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop.
She also had some left-sided weakness. A STAT CT , CTA once again
showed no bleed. At this point , the clot was noted to have moved
from the right ICA into the MCA , and to have dissolved somewhat.
Based upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery from
her stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort of
intervention at that time. She was converted over to heparin
drip with the plan to give her a heparin drip as bridging over
while her Coumadin became therapeutic. She was continued on
heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic. She will be
discharged on Coumadin and continued on Coumadin and aspirin
therapy for life.
3. Esophageal Cancer: She was continued on XRT for the entire
time when she was in the hospital. Conversations between Dr.
Depaoli , Dr. Serl and the family were had and it was felt that she
was no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , in
terms of her other issues. She will be continued on XRT after
discharge from the hospital.
4. Acute Renal Failure: On admission , she was noted to have an
increased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due to
dehydration. However , at the time of admission , she had a BUN of
50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasound
was normal and showed no further defect over the course of her
hospital stay. Her creatinine continued trending down and was
0.9 on the day prior to discharge.
5. CAD: She has a history of CHF with an EF of 50%. She was
monitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed.
She does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline as
well as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing a
wide complex rhythm. There were multiple alarms for VT , which
were simply her baseline rhythm. In the hospital , she was
continued on digoxin , Lopressor , and Imdur. Her Lasix was
initially held , while she was being hydrated , however , it was
restarted after the G-tube was placed and she was getting
sufficient feeds. She was also continued on her statin. She had
no other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital.
6. Nausea: She was treated with Zofran for her nausea when she
was admitted and she continued to have good response to this.
7. Urinary Tract Infection: On the 25 of May she noted that she was
having increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an UA
was done and it was found to be positive for infection. A
culture was performed , which showed enterobacter that was
levo-sensitive. She was started on Levaquin and the Foley , which
had been placed prior was discontinued. She was continued on
Levaquin for a 10-day course and this will be continued for
several days after discharge.
8. Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her Synthroid at her
home dosages while she was in-house.
9. GERD: She was continued on Prevacid while she was in-house.
10. A-fib: She was continued on Coumadin , although it was held
prior to her EGD and G-tube placement. During the time when she
was not therapeutic on her Coumadin she was treated with either
Lovenox subcu. or heparin IV drip titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 ,
therefore she was always therapeutic on her anticoagulin during
this hospital stay.
11. She was initially on a full diet , however , she was unable to
take any p.o. so she was started on tube feeds , which she was
able to make her goal. Nutrition was involved in her care and
she was continued on multivitamin.
12. She was on Lovenox or heparin drip throughout her
hospitalization for DVT prophylaxis. She was also continued on
Prevacid.
CODE STATUS: Full Code , and remained full code throughout her
hospitalization.
COMMUNICATION: There was much communication between her family
throughout this hospitalization in terms of their wishes for her
care and for her discharge , and it was agreed that a rehab would
be a good place for to go at the end of her stay here.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Ainsley is a 60-year-old woman with
a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presented in February of 2001 with pain in the left
lateral aspect of her fifth metatarsophalangeal area without
bleeding. This wound has failed to heal over time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times
20 years , obesity , hypertension , depression ,
sleep apnea.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 8/23/94 incision and drainage and
debridement of abdominal wound. 4/6/94 ,
debridement of abdominal wound. 10/26/94 debridement and closure
of abdominal wound. 1/7/96 debridement of a chronically infected

of nonhealing abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. Ventral
hernia repair and abdominoplasty in 4/27/97. 8/1/97 drainage of
seroma with wound debridement and closure. The patient has also
had an appendectomy in 1994 , cholecystectomy and ventral hernia
repair.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. q day , Prozac 40 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec
20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day , Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q
day , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day and magnesium supplementation of an
unknown quantity.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Weight 315 pounds , blood pressure 130/70 , pulse 68 ,
respiratory rate 18. GENERAL: She was an obese ,
age appropriate elderly female. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact. No jugular venous distention and no bruits. HEART: With
a clear distinct S1 and S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation with no wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender , nondistended with
normal active bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:
Demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. She had radial pulses
2 plus right and 2 plus at the left. Femoral pulses 1 plus
bilaterally. Popliteal pulses 1 plus bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis
pulse was biphasic and so was the posterior tibialis bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the manic vascular
surgery service and she underwent an
uncomplicated debridement of the nonhealing ulcer on the left
lateral aspect of her left forefoot. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was stable in the immediate postoperative
period. The patient was then transferred to the floor where she
underwent a rapid progressive and uncomplicated course of recovery.
The patient&apos;s hospital stay was protracted due to inability of the
patient to mobilize herself with the assistance of physical
therapy. She was screened for rehabilitation placement at this
time but there was some difficulty in placement secondary to bed
non-availability. This immobility is consistent with her
mobilization ambulatory capacity at home as per her own report.
The patient throughout the remainder of her hospital stay had
continued progressive healing of the wound on the lateral aspect of
her left forefoot with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Her finger
stick blood sugars were well controlled. By postoperative day
number seven , June , 2001 the patient was found to have
minimal pain , to be voiding and moving her bowels with ease , to be
ambulating with assistance from physical therapy and a walker , to
demonstrate continued well healing of the ulcer at the lateral
aspect of the left forefoot. She was satting well on room air and
tolerating a diabetic house diet.
A placement in a rehabilitation facility was found and the patient
was discharged to rehabilitation with appropriate follow up and
discharge instructions.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with no wheezes , rales or
rhonchi. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Normal
active bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Pulses at the foot which are
biphasic at the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibialis
bilaterally. The ulcer at the lateral aspect of her left forefoot
was well healing and approximately 0.75 cm in diameter with a well
developed bed of granulation tissue.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4h p.r.n. pain ,
headaches or temperature greater than
101.0 , Prozac 40 mg q day , NPH insulin 60 units q a.m. and 40 units
q p.m. subcutaneously , insulin regular sliding scale subcutaneously
q.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q 4 hours
p.r.n. pain , Senna tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Trazodone 50 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Neurontin 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day ,
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
REMAINING ISSUES: Primarily mobilization. The patient should be
seen by physical therapy to expand her
ambulatory and mobilization capacity. Her wound should be cared
for with wet-to-dry dressing changes twice per day and she should
follow up with Dr. Aljemal in 7-10 days.

Discharge Date: 6/8/2001
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54-year-old gentleman
with a history of progressive angina
over the past several months. The patient had a cardiac
catheterization in September of this year revealing total occlusion of
the RCA and 50% left main disease , with a strong family history of
coronary artery disease with a brother dying at the age of 52 from
a myocardial infarction and another brother who is status post
coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient had a stress
echocardiogram done on September , 2001 , which showed no wall motion
abnormalities , but this was a difficult study due to body habitus.
The patient went for six minutes with minimal ST depressions in the
anterior lateral leads , thought due to fatigue and wrist pain , his
anginal equivalent. Due to the patient&apos;s increased symptoms and
family history and history left main disease with total occasional
of his RCA was referred for revascularization with open heart
surgery.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient
was on Imdur 120 mg p.o. q. day , Lipitor
80 mg p.o. q. day ( about which I am told he was on this high dose
for about one month ) , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day , enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.a.m. and Imdur 60
mg p.o. q.p.m. , nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. for chest pain ,
acebutolol 400 mg p.o. q. day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.
day , vitamin C , multivites , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day , Prozac 20 mg
p.o. q. day , and K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q. day.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history was
significant for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity , panic disorder , question of
asthma , not on inhalers currently , gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
some his of rectal bleeding , but had a sigmoidoscope done in
September of 1999 that showed no disease , psoriasis , and right elbow
tendinitis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past surgical history was
significant for tonsillectomy and
circumcision one year ago.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s social history was negative for
ETOH. The patient had smoked three packs per day
for six years and quit five years ago.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s family history was significant for a
brother who died of an myocardial infarction in
his 50s , a mother with an aneurysm , and a father with emphysema.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure on the right was 142/90 , on
the left 150/80. HEENT revealed the patient
to be non-icteric. There was no jugular venous distention. There
were no carotid bruits noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub , or gallop noted.
The lungs were clear to auscultation without any evidence of
wheezes , rhonchi or rales. The abdomen revealed positive bowel
sounds and was soft , non-tender. It was difficult to assess for
any hepatosplenomegaly due to the patient&apos;s size. The extremities
revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. A few varicosities were
noted. The pulses were 2+ throughout. Neurological examination
revealed the patient to be alert and oriented x 3 and the
examination was grossly non-focal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on May , 2001 and
and was taken to the operating room for coronary
artery bypass grafting x 3 on January , 2001 with RIMA to the OM1 ,
saphenous vein graft to the RCA , and LIMA to the LAD. The total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 155 minutes. The total cross-clamp
time was 108 minutes. The patient came off the heart lung machine
without any difficulties and on no drips. The patient was
extubated on postoperative day number one , January , 2001. The
patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory reasons
and was there for three days. The patient required only diuresis
for improved oxygenation. On postoperative day number three , wires
and chest tubes were removed without any difficulty.
Postoperatively , it was noted on portable x-ray that the patient
had a small right pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
Subsequent chest x-ray showed a decrease in pneumo size. The
patient had a PA model chest x-ray today that was pending and we
will decide on follow-up depending on the chest x-ray today. The
patient , otherwise , remained in normal sinus rhythm and was able to
be weaned off the O2 with diuresis. The patient was , otherwise ,
doing well with plans for discharge on postoperative day number
five to home in stable condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with his
cardiologist , Dr. Labor , in one week. The phone
number is 985-817-2910. The patient will also follow-up with
Dr. Ballengee , telephone number 869-541-1864 , in six weeks for a post
surgical evaluation.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q. day , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q. day ,
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day x five , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet 1-2 tablets q. 4-6 hours
p.r.n. pain , K-Dur 10 mEq p.o. q. day x five days while on Lasix at
that dose , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q. day
per his preoperative dose that he has been on for one month , and
multivitamins 1 tablet p.o. q. day.
ADDENDUM: The follow-up chest x-ray today showed no evidence of
pneumo. We would recommend in the postoperative
follow-up with Dr. Wyzard to have a follow-up chest x-ray.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73 year old male who
was in his usual state of health until
approximately one to two weeks prior to admission , when the patient
had his antihypertensive medications changed. His nifedipine was
discontinued because of gingival hypertrophy and Atenolol was
replaced. Shortly after that he developed increased dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath , especially with walking in the
morning. There was a question of light-headedness. He denied any
chest pain , pressure , or tightness. No jaw , neck or arm symptoms.
No orthopnea or PND. Her also denied visual symptoms or headache.
One day prior to admission the patient was taking a walk and was so
fatigued that he had to stop. On the day of admission the patient
was again taking a walk and was noted by friends to be somewhat
unsteady and diaphoretic. The EMTs were called. The patient was
given Lasix and nitroglycerin with improvement in his symptoms. He
denies cough , fevers , chills , vomiting , melena or hematochezia.
The patient has been taking all of his prescribed medications. No
dietary changes. He notes good appetite , no early satiety. He has
a history of two syncopal episodes in the distant past. On the
morning of the admission the patient has not taken any of his
medications yet.

FAMILY HISTORY: His brother had a heart attack in his late 50s.
The brother also has diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98 , blood pressure
190/98 , pulse 48. O2 saturation was 98% on
two liters by nasal cannula. GENERAL: The patient is an elderly
African-American gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,
talking in complete sentences. HEENT: The left eye has a
nonreactive pupil. The right eye has a small pupil , approximately
2 mm , with a clear cataract. There is no icterus. The oropharynx
was clear with gingival hypertrophy. NECK: Supple , with full
range of motion. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was difficult
to assess because of the large neck. CARDIAC: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. The carotids were
without bruits. PULMONARY: The patient had bibasilar rales with
expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. ABDOMEN:
Protuberant , soft , non-tender. Normoactive bowel sounds. No
organs appreciated. EXTREMITIES: Edema 2+. Femoral pulses were
2+. There were bruits. Distal pulses were intact. RECTAL: The
patient was heme-negative.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Sodium 143 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 24 , BUN 35 , creatinine 2.0 ,
glucose 144. CBC shows WBC 8 , hematocrit 32.9 , platelets 343 , MCV
approximately 80 , RDW approximately 16. Admission CK was 175.
Troponin I was 0.05. Chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilar
infiltrates. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 56. The axis was 20
degrees. The intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. There was LVH by
voltage criteria , an isolated Q in lead 3 , biphasic T waves in AVL ,
and a flat T in lead 3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:
Congestive heart failure: The patient underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.
After that he had an exercise echo. The patient exercised for
three minutes on a modified Bruce , achieving a maximum heart rate
of 97 and a blood pressure of 160. The test was stopped because of
knee pain and shortness of breath. Baseline images prior to
exercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overall
normal function. There were no resting wall motion abnormalities.
Stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of a
posterobasilar hypokinesis. No other wall motion abnormalities
were noted. It was felt that this findings were questionable for
nonspecific finding or ischemia. It was felt that the EKG portion
of the ETT showed no evidence for ischemia. The patient was
diuresed gently with IV Lasix and his shortness of breath improved.
Hypertension: On admission , the patient&apos;s blood pressure was
approximately 220/110. The patient was started on IV nitroglycerin
and IV Labetalol in the Emergency Department. The patient was
subsequently weaned from IV nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.
hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,
respectively. The patient had excellent blood pressure control on
these medications. The patient was discharged with close follow-up
in order to titrate these medications.
Anemia: The patient&apos;s admission hematocrit was 32.2. Subsequent
hematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some lab
error involved. Follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. This was
repeated and was again in the mid 20s. He was transfused two units
of packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. The
findings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum and
a subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. H. pylori studies were
pending at discharge , as were biopsy results. The patient was
started on Prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this for
several weeks. Aspirin was held , as the patient&apos;s EGD findings
were felt to be consistent with NSAID gastritis. Iron studies
obtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.
The serum iron was low. However , the ferritin and TIBC were within
the normal range. Further workup of the patient&apos;s anemia will take
place as an outpatient.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient&apos;s creatinine increased
from admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. This was felt to be secondary
to diuresis , and the patient&apos;s diuretic dose was decreased. The
patient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol inhaler two puffs as needed for shortness of breath
and wheezing.
2. Prilosec 20 mg q d.
3. Symvastatin 10 mg q d.
4. Nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest pain , pressure or
tightness.
5. Aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.
6. Minoxidil 2.5 mg q d.
7. Lisinopril 80 mg q d.
8. Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.
9. Lasix 80 mg q d.
10. Iron sulfate 300 mg b.i.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. He will follow
up with his primary care physician , Dr. Vilca , on
10/1/98 at 9:15 a.m. Condition upon discharge is good.

infection with MRSA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Goettl is an 83-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease , congestive
heat failure , diabetes , and chronic renal insufficiency , status
post bilateral knee replacement 10 years prior who presented to
an outside hospital on the February , 2005 , with one day of mild
confusion , fever , and lethargy. He was initially thought to have
left lower lobe pneumonia , but subsequently left knee effusion
was noted and an arthrocentesis was performed with consistent
with septic arthritis. He was admitted to the hospital for
broad-spectrum antibiotics ( cefepime and vancomycin ) and
subsequently developed hypotension requiring vasopressor support
with dopamine as well as an increased oxygen requirement. His
sepsis was also marked by acute renal failure , mental status
changes , and a non-ST elevation MI. He was transferred to
Su Quierfield Hospital per family request.
At the time of admission , the patient was lethargic but
interactive , orient to person and place and complained of
fatigue , but denied any pain or chest pain or shortness of
breath.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Obtained from family , disclosed one week of
left leg and hip pain , low grade fevers , lethargy , and increased
high-grade fevers starting the day prior to admission. The
patient had no recent travels , sick contacts , trauma , or
exposures.

diabetes complicated by neuropathy , retinopathy , and nephropathy ,
congestive heart failure , hyperlipidemia , chronic renal
insufficiency , status post distant left nephrectomy for unclear
reasons , neuroendocrine tumor , status post chemotherapy and
reception , and esophageal reason felt to be cured , status post
bilateral total knee replacement , status post right total hip
replacement , DVT , PE , status post IVC filter , and chronic lower
extremity lymphedema.
MEDICATIONS AT TRANSFER: Vancomycin , cefepime , atenolol , and
lisinopril.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. , Lipitor , lisinopril

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife and denies any
tobacco , alcohol , or drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
80 , blood pressure 91/52 , respirations 18 , and satting 95% on 6
liters of nasal cannula. The patient was noted to be lethargic
but otherwise had no acute distress. He was oriented to person
and place. Lungs examination revealed a few basilar crackles ,
but otherwise was clear. Cardiac examination had a regular rate
and rhythm with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at left sternal
border nonradiating. Abdomen was unremarkable. His right knee
had a large effusion with erythema , tenderness to palpation , and
limited range of motion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a sodium of 132; a
potassium of 5.1; and a creatinine of 4.0 , up from a baseline of
1.5. White count was 11 , hematocrit was 37.6 , and platelets were
217. Lactic acid was 0.8. Troponin was 0.71. LFTs were within
normal limits.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA: Chest x-ray revealed poor inspiratory effort
and question of left lingular infiltrate , mild pulmonary edema ,
and a calcified left anterior descending artery. EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with incomplete right-bundle branch block , 2
to 3 mm SCD depression in the V3 through V5.
Micro from January , 2005 , Staphylococcus aureus with
sensitivities pending. Blood cultures form January , 2005 ,
Gram-positive cocci , speciation and sensitivities pending.
IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old gentleman with septic shock
likely secondary to infection of his right prosthetic knee
complicated by bacteremia , acute renal failure , myocardial
injury , and mental status changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious Disease. The patient was found to have MRSA ,
septic arthritis complicated by septic shock , bacteremia and
acute renal failure. He was brought to the operating room with
removal of his prosthetic knee and debridement of his surrounding
area with drain replacement. He was started on a 42-day course
of vancomycin 1 g q.12h. and is currently on day #18 as of
February , 2005. He was also noted to have pneumonia on the
left side that bronchoscopy was also thought to be MRSA
pneumonia. Per ID consult , he was started the linezolid for
better lung penetration and is currently on day #8 of 14. He has
been afebrile now with negative cultures since then. Of note , on
bronchoscopy , there was cytopathic changes consistent with HSV
infection , and he was treated with a course of acyclovir also per
infectious disease this is probably unnecessary and presented
contamination from an old lesion.
2. Pulmonary. The patient had a nosocomial pneumonia with MRSA
and was intubated for inability to handle secretions and mental
status changes. He had a tracheostomy placed and has been
tolerating that breathing on trach collar during the day and
resting on pressure support of 5 and 5 overnight. BBG are
followed with a PC02 goal of less than 55 and a pH of greater
than 7.30 when these were correlated to his arterial blood gas.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in distributive
shock on Neo-Synephrine with a troponin leak secondary to demand
physiology. He had an echo performed , which demonstrated
diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction. He also
had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response in the setting of an acute septic shock. He is
currently in normal sinus rhythm with cardiac enzymes having
resolved. He has been maintained on aspirin , Lipitor , and
Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.
4. Renal. The patient was noted to be in acute renal failure ,
which is now resolved and with a creatinine at back to baseline
of 1.2 to 1.5.
5. Hematology. The patient has anemia of chronic disease with
crit at baseline of 30. He should be transfused for transfusion
goal of 26 , although there has been no evidence of acute blood
loss during his hospital course other than perioperative excepted
acute drop in crit which is now resolved.
6. Endocrine. The patient was on 50 units of Lantus as an
outpatient but did have episodes of hypoglycemia in the setting
of sepsis and poor nutritional status. He is currently on Lantus
20 units , which can be slowly increased if his blood sugars are
running high. Additional glucose management can be maintained
with sliding scale insulin.
7. Pain/Psych. The patient had peristent delirium likely the
combination of infection pain , ICU delirium , and treatment with
Versed and fentanyl. He had a head CT , which was negative for
any acute process , and once his intravenous narcotic and
benzodiazepine were stopped , his delirium rapidly cleared over 24
to 48 hours. The patient is now on a fentanyl patch for pain
control , which can be increased as his sensorium clears and
Haldol was effective for agitation as well.
8. Gastrointestinal/FEN. The patient had PEG placement to
supplement nutrition and has been tolerating tube feeds without
difficulty.
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium and
subcutaneous Lovenox.
10. Code Status. The patient is full code.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DYSPNEA.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , DIABETES MELLITUS
AND STATUS POST CVA.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 66 year-old male complaining of shortness of
breath times six months.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: At baseline the patient exerts
himself without significant chest
pain or pressure. Last February he recalls the onset of shortness
of breath gradually over several months time. Maximal exertion has
been limited by walking utilization at one-quarter mile with
significant symptoms fatigue. The development of severe shortness
of breath occurred most rapidly eight days prior to admission when
he experienced air starvation while getting into a car associated
with significant difficulty with speech and slurring times two
minutes. There was no muscle weakness , visual change , loss of
consciousness , palpitation , but the patient did feel as if he was
about to lose consciousness. Mr. Morath also denied labored
breathing , though his breathing was noted to be shallow and
improved immediately thereafter. There was cough associated with
post nasal drip but not hemoptysis. He admitted to left sided
chest pain lasting 30 seconds which was believed not to be cardiac
by his outpatient cardiologist , Dr. Joshua Lietzke On 10/20 he
was admitted to Com Sweeelkprai Medical Center Of for two days where echocardiogram
was performed as well as a chest x-ray and he was ruled out for
myocardial infarction. A VQ scan was then arranged for 5/20 at
which time he also had a Dobutamine Sestamibi scan. The test were
not available at the time of his admission the Ci Of Center on 11/9 At the time of his admission he denied any
shortness of breath though admitted to shortness of breath with
minimal exertion.
MEDICATION: NPH Insulin , Regular INsulin , Glucophage and Aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease. No history of
myocardial infarction. ( 2 ) Status post

proximal left anterior descending lesion , totally occluded circ and
50% ramus with an right coronary artery mid-85% stenosis. Left
ventricular ejection fraction was 61% at that time. Coronary
artery bypass graft in 1995 was LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , SVG to
Ramus , SVG to OM. Sestamibi scan performed in July of hte year
2000 demonstrated 5 out of 20 segments of mild inferior ischemia

diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 1980. ( 4 ) Cerebrovascular accident
1997 with residual right lower extremity motor debilitation and
word finding. ( 5 ) P32 , Calcium 45 , Carbon 14 exposure at work.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a microbiologist at Ford , works on virus in Vandmi Ave , Co , New York 88983 harbor and
lives in Delpa He has a tobacco history significant for 35
pack years of pipe and cigarette smoking. He has no significant
alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.2 , Heart rate
66 , Blood pressure 144/84 , 96% O2 sat on
room air. NECK: JVP was at 8 cm , carotids 2+ bilaterally without
bruit and no lymphadenopathy. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with
a loud P2 at the left upper sternal border and S4. LUNGS: Clear
to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. ABDOMEN:
Obese , nontender , nondistended with normal abdominal bowel sounds
and a palpable liver margin. Right rib cage nontender.
EXTREMITIES: Demonstrated 1+ bilateral pitting edema with palpable
pulses bilaterally , they were cool.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: Normal electrolytes with serum creatinine
of 0.8. White blood count 9.7. Hematocrit
32.2. Platelets 225. Serial CK&apos;s were obtained and were 35 , 36 ,
and 31. Dedimer was 411. Troponin I was 0.01. Electrocardiogram
demonstrated atrial flutter with a 4 to 1 block at 65 beats per
minute without ST-T wave changes. He ambulated times four minus
with a D sat from 95% to 90 to 92 %.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 66 year-old male with coronary disease ,
status post coronary artery bypass graft with an
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complained of excellerating
shortness of breath times six months with minimal exertion. After
a presentation with low intermediate pre-test probability for
pulmonary embolus , we obtained a VQ scan that was determiend to be
intermediate probability. The patient was then referred for a
coronary angiography. This was performed on 2/23 and revealed
three vessel native coronary disease and one occluded bypass graft.
Left anterior descending artery had a discrete mid 50 % stenosis
occluded distally. The ramus had a smooth discrete 80% stenosis.

ATTENDING: STOMBERG , MARLON MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
The patient is admitted for a right gluteal hematoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with coronary artery disease
status post recent bare metal stenting in August ,
hypercholesterolemia , CLL and peripheral arterial disease and
admitted for increasing right thigh pain and falling
hematocrit at rehabilitation. The patient had a complicated
hospitalization in August where he presented with a severe
right MRSA infection of his right lower extremity. During
hospitalization , he required a revascularization prior to
undergoing surgery and had a bare metal stent placed to his left
anterior descending artery. After his stenting , he underwent a left BKA to
eradicate his left lower
extremity infection and was later noted to have a
right upper extremity clot associated with central venous catheter. The
patient was discharged from the hospital in August on Lovenox
80 mg twice daily and on Coumadin with the plan that his Lovenox
be stopped at the time of his Coumadin reaching a therapeutic
level. He was also discharged on aspirin and Plavix for his bare
metal stent. On the day prior to admission , the patient was
noted to have a hematocrit of 24 at rehab and on the day of
admission the Hct rechecked and was found to be 18. For this , he was
transferred to the Landm Hospital for further
workup. The patient denies any blood in the stool , melena ,
dizziness or lightheadedness. He does note some pain on his
right side , particularly his right upper thigh and gluteal
area. He denies any recent trauma. He felt some weakness in his
right leg but has had no paresthesias or pain. He states that
his leg has been at all times warm.
ED COURSE:
The patient was noted to be guaiac negative and complained of
some mild abdominal fullness. He received an abdominal CT , which
showed a very large right gluteal hematoma with a fresh fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed. The patient was given packed red
blood cells and was noted to have a potassium level of 5.8 for
which he received Kayexalate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Type II diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease status
post MI in 1997. He had a nonST elevation MI in 3/29 for
which he underwent catheterization. Catheterization at that time
showed an 80% left anterior descending lesion , which was stented
to 0 with a bare metal stent , 80% diagonal and first diagonal
lesion and a 100% circumflex lesion. The patient has known
significant peripheral vascular disease status post left TMA in
4/3 with fem-pop in 4/3 , left foot debridement in 5/26
and finally a left BKA in 6/26 He has congestive heart
failure with last ejection fraction of 32% , hyperlipidemia , gout ,
CLL status post fludarabine x4 cycles in 2004 in which has been
stable with no evidence of residual or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy , BPH , chronic kidney disease with a baseline
creatinine of 2.5 , and glaucoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was in no acute distress. Normocephalic , atraumatic.
His eyes were anicteric. His extraocular membranes were intact.
Mucous membranes were moist without exudates. His neck was
supple , with full range of motion. He had 2+ carotid pulses on
both sides without any evidence of bruits. His jugular venous
pressure was approximately 8 cm of water at 30 degrees of
elevation. His lungs were notable for bibasilar crackles with
left side greater than right. Cardiovascular exam: He had
regular sinus rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , and he had a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur at his base. This seemed to radiate to
his axilla. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
He had normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants , no
hepatosplenomegaly or masses. His extremities are notable for a
right-sided gluteal hematoma with fullness and thickening. He
does have 1+ palpable DP pulse on that side confirmed with
Doppler. Skin was without rash , ecchymosis , or petechiae. His
neurological exam was intact. He was alert and oriented x3.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. He had intact
motor and sensation in his right lower extremity along with ,
however , was noted to have a baseline neuropathy with sensory
loss up to his admission.
Admission EKG is normal for normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , old
T-wave inversions in I and aVL and an isolated ST elevation in
lead 2.
Notable studies during this admission included CT of the abdomen
on admission which showed a new right gluteal hematoma with fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed.
ADMISSION LABS:
Potassium 5.8 , creatinine 2.1 , hematocrit of 22.3. He had an MRI
of his brain done on 5/29/06 which showed subacute infarction on
the right anterior internal capsule and chronic occlusion of the
left internal carotid and old left parietal stroke. He had an
echocardiogram done on 10/1/06 with an ejection fraction of
30-35% , trace aortic insufficiency , trace mitral regurgitation ,
trace tricuspid regurgitation and PA systolic pressures of 33+
right atrial pressure.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 62-year-old man admitted for a falling hematocrit with
an evolving right gluteal hematoma secondary to supratherapeutic
anticoagulation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS:
1. Right gluteal hematoma. The patient was admitted for low
hematocrit in the setting of being on multiple anticoagulant and
antiplatelet drugs. He was found to have right gluteal hematoma
which was responsible for his acute hematocrit drop. His
Coumadin , Lovenox , aspirin , and Plavix were initially held. He
received vitamin K and three units of FFP to reverse his
coagulopathy. He was also transfused a total of 6 units of PRBCs
for a goal hematocrit of 30 given his cardiac and neurologic
disease as described below. There was no evidence of further
hematocrit drop. Given that he had been anticoagulated due to
right upper extremity DVT and that the indication for
anticoagulation in the setting and catheter associated clot is
somewhat murky , it was felt that the patient would not benefit
from addition of anticoagulation and therefore his Lovenox and
Coumadin were discontinued. He was restarted on his aspirin and
and his Plavix and his Hct remained stable.
2. Non-ST-elevation MI. The patient was admitted in August
and was known to have three-vessel coronary disease and had
underwent stenting of his LAD with a bare metal stent on
6/28/06. After discussion with the cardiologist , he was stopped
on aspirin and Plavix given the evolution of hematoma and his
acute hematocrit drop. During his lowest hematocrit period , the
patient was noted to have lateral ST depressions and this
corresponded to a troponin leak with a peak troponin of 2.46.
The etiology of this was felt to be demand related to his
profound anemia and on correction of his anemia , the patient&apos;s ST
depressions resolved fully and his troponins trended downward.
The patient was known to have a presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy
following his nonST elevation MI. He was found to have an
ejection fraction of 30-35%. He will
need to have a repeat echocardiogram done in one month&apos;s time to
assess whether or not he would benefit from an implantable
cardiac defibrillator. The patient&apos;s blood pressure medications
were adjusted as follows. His blood pressure medications were
initially held due to his stroke-like symptoms at the time of
admission when his low hematocrit. As detailed below , however ,
they were slowly added back. He tolerated slow titration of
beta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ACE
inhibitor which was felt to be important given his extensive peripheral
vascular disease and his
low ejection fraction.
3. Recrudescence of stroke-like symptoms in the setting of the
patient&apos;s acute hematocrit drop. The patient was noted to have
worsening slurred speech and a right facial droop. He does carry
a history of left internal carotid occlusion and left-sided
stroke in the past. The Neurology team was consulted for these acute deficits
and requested an MRI. The MRI showed basically old known strokes and a
subacute right
internal capsule stroke that was felt to be unrelated to his
current symptomatology. He initially had his
antihypertensives to allow for maximal perfusion pressure. However , as
his coagulopathy resolved , it was felt that the stress that
resulted in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptoms was
resolved and he was able tolerate , further addition of his
antihypertensives without further incident.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was seen by physical therapy and given his recent
below the knee amputation , it was felt to be best served by going
back to rehab.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharged medications are as
follows:
1. Tylenol 650 mg q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
2. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
3. Colace 100 mg twice daily.
4. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously daily.
5. Nexium 40 mg daily.
6. Lasix 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night which his IO
goals should be about -500 cc of fluid per day.
7. Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d.
8. Aspart 10 units subcutaneous with meals.
9. Aspart sliding scale.
9. Glargine 42 units daily.
10. Xalatan one drop.
11. Lisinopril 15 mg daily.
12. Toprol-XL 200 mg daily.
13. Niferex 150 mg daily.
14. Zocor 40 mg at night.
15. Flomax 0.4 mg daily.
16. Multivitamin one tablet daily.
17. Zinc 220 mg daily.
18. Plavix 75 mg po daily
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
The patient is to call his primary care physician , Dr. Lupe Bario and his cardiologist , Dr. Mraw , following
discharge from rehabilitation. At that time , he should have
repeat echocardiogram to assess his candidacy for an implantable
cardiac defibrillator.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: YONG KINGSTON MD , PHD
The patient is an TUHAMC patient. Her primary cardiologist is Dr.
Pegram
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Flora is a 50-year-old woman
with coronary artery disease and extensive vascular disease who
presented to the ED with worsening chest pain at rest and at
baseline has exertional chest pain. She had been experiencing
increasing chest pain of late and was referred to CT surgery for
surgical evaluation to correct her CAD and ischemia. She had
been at an office visit on the date of admission with Dr. Rudicil
and began to experience terrible chest pain and Dr. Nacke
referred her to the Clare Taho Medical Center ED for an urgent
evaluation. In the ED , she was noted to be afebrile with a
temperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respirations 16 , and
satting 98% on 2 liters. She was noted on EKG to be in normal
sinus rhythm with 2-mm ST depressions in II , III , and aVF V4
through V6. She was given aspirin , morphine , metoprolol ,
Mucomyst , Ativan , nitroglycerin and was made pain-free and was
sent to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to the
diagonal #1 placed 6/21/04 was no longer patent , as a cause for
her unstable angina. She had been recently told that no further
intervention was possible after her stent to the diagonal #1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease
status post CABG in 1996 , which involved LIMA to LAD ( free ) and
SVG to OM1. Peripheral vascular disease. Status post FEM-POP and
fem-fem bypass in 2003. End-stage renal disease status post
cadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed.
IDDM , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , retinopathy , TIA , lower GI
bleed , chronic diarrhea , CMV colitis , anemia , and bladder CA ,
recent diagnosis not yet worked up.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg , azathioprine 50 mg a
day , calcium carbonate 650 mg b.i.d. , Colace 150 mg b.i.d. ,
lispro sliding scale , Lantus , multivitamin , folate , Lopressor 25
mg t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg a day , Zocor 80 mg q.h.s. , Plavix 75
mg q. day as well as Zetia 10 mg a day.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , Benadryl , penicillin , and Compazine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband and has two children.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , Ms. Ameling was taken to the
cardiac catheterization suite where it was found that her
circumflex was 60% , which had been 60% stenosis , now 100%
stenosed. Her diagonal #1 status post stent was now 100%
stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease was
unchanged. Her right heart cath revealed elevated filling
pressures and PTCA and stent was carried out of the occluded
diagonal #1 stent as well as the LAD , but she became hypotensive ,
bradycardic , and developed cardiogenic shock requiring CPR and
intubation. She had an IBP placed and subsequently an echo was
done to rule out effusion and was negative , but had an apparently
low EF. She had suspected transient decrease in flow to her
septal arteries and this likely compounded her acute myocardial
infarction. Following insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump ,
it was noted that she had absent pulses in her right foot , which
was noted also to be cool to touch. She was transferred to the
CCU , intubated and sedated , unresponsive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her JVP was elevated. Her lungs had
coarse breath sounds anterolaterally , but without crackles or
wheezes. Her heart was regular , tachycardic with a gallop and a
3/6 harsh systolic murmur at the base of her heart and a 2/6
holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. She had somewhat
decreased bowel sounds , but her belly was soft and nondistended.
Her bilateral lower extremities were cool with absent pulses in
her feet to palpation and her right foot was mottled and was
notably cooler without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Her CK was over 100 , MB 7 , troponin 0.92 , INR
0.9 , and platelets 191 , 000. She later developed acute renal
failure and dialysis was initiated on Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday schedule. Her echo showed an EF of 30% with severe MR as
well as inferoseptal and inferior akinesis. The balloon pump was
eventually taken out , the dopamine drip was discontinued. She
was stabilized and extubated. She was stable for several days ,
but on 9/1/04 in the evening experienced an episode of unstable
VT arrest requiring shock x 1. no further defibrillation was
needed. She stabilized after her V-TACH arrest and shocking and
per Electrophysiology Service , she was loaded with amiodarone and
has been continued on 200 mg p.o. q.6h. after being titrated off
her amiodarone drip.

and no further intervention can be offered to her after
discussion with both Dr. Kohler &apos;s Surgical team and the EP
Service. She should not undergo any further catheterizations or
revascularization. She is currently on Aspirin , Plavix ,
Lopressor , and Zocor. She was briefly on Lipitor , but this was
discontinued after a bump in her LFTs. She is not on an ACE or
an ARB secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time of
this dictation her renal function remains poor and there are no
plans to restart an ACE inhibitor or ARB.
b. Pump: Ms. Livernoche has ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe
MR and she is undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly is getting
several liters per hemodialysis session as her blood pressure
tolerates.
c. Rhythm: Ms. Mcelhiney had an episode of ischemic and unstable
ventricular tachycardia requiring shocking. Electrophysiology
evaluated her for the possibility of an AICD placement , but this
has been deferred for now and it is unlikely that she will ever
have an AICD placed , certainly not on this hospitalization. She
has been loaded with amiodarone and is currently on 800 mg a day ,
split into 200 mg q.6h. p.o. and after 10 days she should be
changed to 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will take place on February She initially tolerated amiodarone very poorly secondary
to nausea , so her dose was titrated up gradually.
c. Peripheral vascular disease: Ms. Fassett has extensive
peripheral vascular disease and Vascular Surgery is following her
for a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary to
ischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump. She is
having the circumferences of her cath measured once or twice a
day and these have not been increasing , have in fact been
decreasing. Also , her creatinine kinase levels have been
followed as a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these have
been decreasing and are currently normal. At the time of this
dictation , her CK was 75 down from the 10 , 000 range. She was on
heparin for some time and although her cath continues to be
tender , the pain has improved and the function has gradually
returned. Her pulses remained poor. She had lower extremity
noninvasive Dopplers to evaluate her arterial venous flow and no
clot was noted in the venous circulation. There was no comment
made on the FEM-FEM graft , however , but no note was made of an
arterial clot. She should have the circumferences of her right
calf followed closely at the place that they are marked on the
right lower extremity.
2. Renal: Ms. Barrete has acute on chronic renal failure. She
was admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 and her creatinine has been
up and down depending on the timing of her dialysis; however , she
is relatively anuric , but occasionally produces small volumes of
urine and this should be followed carefully as well. She is
continuing on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and
she did have one positive UA , but this is not being treated
because it is difficult to assess secondary to her extremely
concentrated urine , but should be followed if she does produce
urine. This may be permanent , but it is not clear at this point
she may be on hemodialysis indefinitely. She is on fluid
restriction per renal recommendations of 1000 cc per day intake
and her ARB is being held for now.
3. ID: Ms. Helmy spiked on 11/5/04 to 101.8 and she has
been found to have a line infection with a positive triple-lumen
catheter tip as well as positive blood cultures. She was started
on vancomycin on 4/7/04 and this is being dosed according to
her vancomycin troughs , which are drawn once a day. If her
trough is near or below 15 she should be given one dose of
vancomycin and this has turned out to be approximately every
other day.
4. Heme: Ms. Kornn &apos;s platelets have been dropping from the
100s to the mid 50s since she was started on amiodarone. It is
not clear what the source is. She has had two negative HIT
antibodies , platelet factor IV antibodies , and her platelets
seemed to have stabilized in the high 40s , mid 50s and she is not
showing any signs of acute bleed , but this has been communicated
with Electrophysiology Service who is aware of the possibility
that amiodarone may be causing her thrombocytopenia and the
amiodarone has been continued unless her thrombocytopenia worsens
significantly. She is also on a number of other medications that
may cause thrombocytopenia and these will be followed as well ,
however , it was only the amiodarone for which the timing was
coincident with the drop in her platelets.
5. Pulmonary: Ms. Wenrich has a large right pleural effusion;
it was tapped on 10/14/04 , 600 cc were removed. It was noted to
be transudative. The tap was complicated by the patient slipping
off her bed during the procedure. She was caught and did not
fall , but the pleural effusion was not completely drained and she
developed a small hydropneumothorax. This should be followed.
She also had a CT subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there
was no evidence of that. The pleural effusion is evident on her
chest x-rays with underlying consolidation. There has been no
compromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and this
should be followed since it will likely reaccumulate after
tapping , but if she becomes more symptomatic it should be tapped.
6. Ms. Delperdang is on prednisone. For her diabetes , she is on
NPH and an insulin sliding scale.
7. She experienced an increase in her LFTs , her transaminases
bumped to several 100s , and her total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 ,
her alkaline phosphatase also bumped , however , this may have been
secondary to the starting Lipitor and this was discontinued.
They have trended down since then. It is not clear exactly the
source of her increase in LFTs. She has been restarted on Zocor
at a very low dose at 10 mg and this should be titrated up as her
LFTs tolerate. She was on Zocor as an outpatient and we hope
that this is not a class effect and that it is not going to be
related to the dose of her Zocor.
8. GI: Her nausea should be treated with p.r.n. Ativan and
Zofran. She has a Compazine allergy.
9. Code status: Ms. Cubeta is DNR/DNI , but family does desire
that if they may help that pressures in shock can be used.

Discharge Date: 4/10/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: CHIEF COMPLAINT is coronary artery
disease. The patient is a 48 year old
male with new-onset angina and a positive exercise tolerance test ,
admitted at this time for elective cardiac catheterization. The
patient first noted chest tightness while walking in the cold 4
months ago. He subsequently had a positive exercise tolerance test
at a very short period of time. The thallium test showed
reperfusion in the anteroseptal and apex areas. The cardiac
catheterization this admission showed 50% proximal circumflex , 70%
obtuse marginal branch #2 , mid right coronary artery subtotal
occlusion , and 80% left anterior descending. He had hypokinetic
left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%.
ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
reveals hypertension and adult-onset diabetes with
hypercholesterolism. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Diabeta 10
milligrams by mouth each morning , Vasotec 5 milligrams by mouth per
day , atenolol 50 milligrams by mouth twice a day , iron sulfate ,
allopurinol , Colace , aspirin and ciprofloxacin 500 twice a day
times 5 days. The patient is a former smoker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese male , with
examination otherwise unremarkable , no
cardiac abnormalities , lungs were clear.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrolytes were normal preoperatively ,
except for sugar in the middle 150&apos;s
range.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to surgery on 15 of November ,
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting times 3 with left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending , left saphenous vein graft to the marginal and
to the posterior descending artery. The patient tolerated the
procedure well. The posterior descending artery graft had to be
lengthened intraoperatively as it was somewhat tight at the time of
sternum closure. There were no persistent ST changes.
Postoperatively the patient did well. He had one event , which was
felt to be vasovagal in nature in which he had an episode of chest
tight and shortness of breath with diaphoresis. However , serial
enzymes and electrocardiograms were normal. This episode occurred
immediately after the patient had overheard a Code Blue on the
intercom , awakening him in the middle of the night. The patient
also had his discharge delayed for approximately 36 hours because
of a very low-grade temperature , which resolved prior to discharge.
He had minimal erythema of the proximal saphenous vein harvest
site , for which he was placed on ciprofloxacin 5 days
postoperatively in oral form.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) CHOLOLITHIASIS. ( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY
DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Cocker is a 68-year-old Spanish
speaking man with a known history of
coronary artery disease , who was in his usual state of health until
August , 1999 when he began to developed right upper quadrant pain ,
and was seen by his primary care physician and sent to the
emergency room with a diagnosis of possible early acute
cholecystitis. The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service at
Xole Medical Center , but managed medically without a
operative procedure with antibiotics including ampicillin ,
gentamicin , and Flagyl. The quality of the patient&apos;s right upper
quadrant pain was noted as sharp and constant with nausea but no
vomiting , fevers , chills , back pain , or urinary symptoms. The pain
lasted several hours postprandially and had no radiation. In
addition , the patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 142 , potassium 4.1 , CO2 102 , bicarbonate
30 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 247. WBC at
11.2 , hematocrit 41.2 , platelets 258. ALT 122 , AST 172 , alkaline
phosphatase 211 , total bilirubin 0.7 , direct bilirubin 0.2.
Amylase 38 , Albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.2 , phosphate 3.0. Urinalysis
was negative.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 62
with no signs of acute ischemia.
Chest x-ray is clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE ( by system ): ( 1 ) Gastrointestinal: The patient
was admitted to the Surgical Service
for , likely , cholecystis , and managed medically. He was made
n.p.o. , and hydrated with intravenous fluids and started on triple
antibiotics including ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl. The
patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood count
throughout his hospital course on the Surgical Service. However ,
his alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin became elevated and
the Gastroenterology Medical Service was consulted for
consideration of ERCP. The patient then underwent ERCP on March , 1999 , where a distal common bile duct stone was noted , and an
attempt at removal of the stone was made. However , the stone could
not be extracted. Therefore , the procedure was aborted , and the
patient was transferred to the Medical Service for further
management. The patient&apos;s liver function tests remained stable
after the attempt of the common bile duct stone removal , and he
continued to remain pain free and afebrile. Given the observation
of a common bile duct stone , the GI Service thought it appropriate
to take the patient back for repeat ERCP two days later. Repeat
ERCP showed that there was no residual stone , and no additional
stones were noted. The patient was then advanced on his
diet , which he tolerated with no further symptoms. The patient
continued to be followed by the Surgical Service who recommended ,
then , an elective cholecystectomy as an outpatient at a later date.
( 2 ) Cardiovascular: Given the patient&apos;s history of coronary artery
disease , a cardiology consult was obtained by the Surgical Service ,
who then continued to follow the patient once he was transferred to
the Medical Service. Preoperative evaluation for possible
cholecystectomy was performed , and it was noted that the patient&apos;s
coronary artery disease included the following history: The
patient had a coronary catheterization in 1995 , which revealed a 30
percent left anterior descending artery , proximal as well as mid
stenosis , as well clean circumflex , 70 to 90 percent obtuse
marginal lesion , and a 40 percent , 40 percent , and 70 percent
serial right coronary artery lesions , as well as a 70 percent
posterior descending artery lesion. At that time , obtuse marginal
angioplasty was performed. An left ventriculogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 69 percent at the time. In January 1996 , the
patient had an exercise tolerance test , in which the patient went
six minutes and 30 seconds with 1 millimeter ST depressions , which
were highly predictive of ischemia , but the patient had no
symptoms , and he refused intervention at that time.
The cardiology consult concluded that given the patient&apos;s history
of coronary artery disease , a recommendation was made to perform a
nuclear imaging study to assess the patient&apos;s ischemic risk for a
cholecystectomy. An exercise tolerance test MIBI was performed , in
which the patient had a good work load. However , moderate to
severe inferoapical ischemia was noted on MIBI images. Given the
urgent need for ERCP during this hospital course , catheterization
was postponed , and the patient remained chest pain free and symptom
free throughout his hospital course from a cardiology perspective.
He was continued on medications , which included Lopressor ,
lisinopril , and Diltiazem. Persistent hypertension was controlled
by increasing the dose of beta blocker with good response. Aspirin
was held secondary to consideration of ERCP and the possibility of
gastrointestinal bleed. Given that the patient remained symptom
free from a cardiac standpoint , cardiology consult decided that the
patient&apos;s cardiac catheterization would be deferred until after
this hospitalization , in light of the possible complications of
adding a TB3A antagonist during percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty in the context of possible ERCP. Therefore , the
patient will be followed up in cardiology for elective
catheterization.
( 3 ) Endocrine: The patient&apos;s diabetes was well controlled with his
insulin regimen , which was held while he was n.p.o. , as well as on
an insulin sliding scale.
( 4 ) Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughout
his hospital course , but was continued on ampicillin , gentamicin ,
and Flagly per surgery recommendations.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.
( 2 ) NPH insulin subcutaneous 50 units
q.a.m. ( 3 ) Regular insulin subcutaneous 10 units q.a.m.
( 4 ) Lisinopril 40 milligrams p.o. q.d. ( 5 ) Nitroglycerin 1 tablet
sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain.
( 6 ) Procardia XL 90 milligrams p.o. q.d. ( 7 ) Atenolol 50
milligrams p.o. q.d.
DISCHARGE ACTIVITY: As tolerated.
DISCHARGE DIET: ADA 2 , 000 calories per day , low saturated fat ,
low cholesterol diet.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with the surgery clinic for
scheduling of elective cholecystectomy on October ,
1999 , as well as follow up with cardiology for an elective
catheterization.

extubation and was begun on Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Hematologic: The patient received blood transfusions as
indicated , which included 1 unit packed red blood cells on
postoperative day #1 for a hematocrit of 25 as well as 3 units of
packed blood cells on postoperative day #2. Platelet count was
noted to be below 50 on postoperative day #2 and a HIT panel was
sent which was negative x1. The patient has second HIT panel
pending upon discharge from the ICU. Platelets have been noted
to increase to 72 after nadir on postoperative day #2.
7 ID: The patient has had no issues and received appropriate
perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis vancomycin.

Discharge Date: 6/24/1999
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Thirty-seven-year-old gentleman with
a history of angina in the past. In
1995 , a work-up was negative with a negative stress test and
treated medically two months ago regarding exertional angina and
progression of angina on day of admission. He was admitted to the
Missconbar Clinic at which time his EKG showed supraventricular
changes in 2 , 3 , and ABF with T-wave inversions in 1 , AVL , and
V4-6. He was cathed at that time which showed 100% LAD and 40%
proximal mid-RCA and a 50% proximal posterior LV branch. The
patient was transferred over to the Dy Hospital
for further management and surgery.
On 11/9 , the patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of 55% with mild inferior to posterior
hypokinesis , trivial mitral regurgitation. He was cathed with an
attempt to angioplasty the LAD but failed and had a stent placed

accident. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of
murmurs , gallops or rubs. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. No
evidence of rales , wheezes , or rhonchi. Abdomen: Positive bowel
sounds , soft , non-tender. No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: No evidence of edema or varicosities. Scar to the
right knee secondary to laceration. Vascular: 2+ pulses
throughout with a patent Allen on the left hand. Neurological:
Alert and oriented x three. Grossly non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Within normal limits. A chest x-ray showed
no acute pulmonary disease. EKG was in normal
sinus rhythm. The patient was referred for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 9/8/99 to the
Coronary Care Unit and was taken down to the
Catheterization Laboratory with attempt to angioplasty his LAD but
failed angioplasty and had a stent placed and noted a dissection of
his LAD. The patient was started on tirofiban , Heparin , and IV TNG
and referred to the cardiac surgeons for coronary artery bypass
grafting. The patient was also seen by the Plastic Surgery Service
for evaluation of a radial harvest for graft conduit. The patient
had positive patent arch by Allens on the left. The patient was
right handed so it was consented for a left radial harvest. The
patient was taken to the Operating Room on 10/6 and underwent a
coronary artery bypass grafting x four with a LIMA to the LAD , a
radial artery to the second diagonal , and a saphenous vein graft
sequential to the patent ductus arteriosus and posterior LV branch.
The patient on examination of his LAD was found to have a
dissection in the mid-portion from the previous PTCA about 2.5 to
3.0 cm. Anastomosis was done with the LIMA and the two layers of
the LAD artery was reattached with suture.
The patient came off the heart lung machine with no difficulty and
was taken to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit and was
extubated on post-op day number one doing well from cardiopulmonary
standpoint and transferred to the Step-down Unit on post-op day
number four. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and had
an uncomplicated post-op course except for temperature spike on
post-op day number four to 101. He was pan-cultured. A chest
x-ray showed a slight posterior effusion with question of
consolidation. Some consolidation on the lung field. Sputum only
grew out oroflora. Blood cultures were negative with no growth so
far and a urinalysis was negative. His temperature was felt to be
due to his lung atelectasis , ?start of pneumonia and the patient
was started on Levofloxacin p.o. The patient had no further
temperature and remained afebrile for the next 24 hours. The
patient had no evidence of elevation in his white count.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home on post-op day
number five in stable condition.

Discharge Date: 5/30/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. STATUS POST RIGHT CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73 year old male with a
history of hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , congestive heart failure , who has had multiple previous
admissions to Lourdes Memorial Medical Center with exacerbations of
his congestive heart failure , most recently 27 of February The patient
was reasonably well until approximately 4-5 weeks ago when he
initially noticed slight worsening of bilateral ankle swelling.
This has progressively worsened until the date of admission when
swelling had progressed up to his waist. In the last 2-3 weeks , he
also noted slow worsening of his exertional dyspnea. Prior to
this , he was rarely limited by shortness of breath , but does not
exert himself much. Recently , however , exercise tolerance has
decreased to 3 to 50 feet on flat ground. Patient denied shortness
of breath at rest until yesterday evening when he noted slight
dyspnea also associated with a vague chest tightness. Patient
subsequently went to bed , slept on his usual two pillows. He woke
suddenly at 4:00 A.M. the morning of admission with severe
shortness of breath , chest tightness , and a sensation of general
fatigue. He was unable to get back to sleep because of worsened
orthopnea. His daughter called the EMTs who took the patient to
the Pathhydenoa Ryside Community Hospital Emergency Room. His initial EKG showed a
rate of 150 and he was loaded with procainamide after no change
after being treated with IV adenosine. After treatment with O2 ,
his chest tightness resolved. He denied nausea , vomiting ,
lightheadedness or diaphoresis on presentation. He also denied
palpitations during the past few weeks , but has noted episodic
palpitations in the past. He denies any previous episodes of chest
pain or angina. In addition , he denies syncope and presyncope.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure/ischemic
cardiomyopathy with recent echo of 10/16 with
an ejection fraction of 20% with antero and inferior apical
hypokinesis. 2. Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed in 1988 , treated with oral agents. 3. Hypertension. 4.
Status post varicose vein surgery of the left leg.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.day , digoxin 0.25 mg q.day ,
glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , lisinopril 10 mg q.day , Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient is a retired ship engineer , immigrated
to the Dayna Sas from Shanpro Owma Street He lives with
his daughter in Li , originally from Monte Terster Go He
smokes 1/2 pack per day x 48 years , stopped when he moved to the
Sy Virgs Lihamdale Alcohol - intermittent binge drinking without
regular heavy consumption.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate was 120 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
without orthostatic change. HEENT showed
pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Extracular movements
intact. Oropharynx was clear. Neck showed JVP above the jaw with
a question of A waves. Chest showed decreased breath sounds at the
bases bilaterally with bibasilar crackles. Cardiac exam was
regularly irregular S1 , S2 , + S3 and S4 , 2/6 pansystolic murmur to
the apex. Abdominal exam was soft , nontender , nondistended , with a
palpable liver edge , nonpulsatile. No splenomegaly. Extremities
showed 3+ bilateral pitting edema. Distal pulses were not palpable
bilaterally. Femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic exam was
grossly nonfocal. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary
vascular redistribution and perivascular cuffing. EKG showed
atrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 135 with
intraventricular conduction delay with right bundle branch block
pattern , as well as poor R wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular. After patient had been
treated with procainamide in the emergency room ,
he became hypotensive and was subsequently cardioverted. His blood
pressure recovered to his baseline of 90 systolic and he was
started on Ace inhibitors. He was also treated with IV Lasix and
started on heparin. Because of his disproportionate right
ventricular failure , he did undergo a VQ scan which was low
probability.
Patient had recurrent episodes of atrial tachycardia and was loaded
orally with amiodarone. In addition , he had some short runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
After aggressive diuresis , the patient was noted to have an
increasing BUN/creatinine. He was started on IV dobutamine on
14 of July and was continued on captopril and Isordil. He diuresed well
on dobutamine and was restarted on digoxin. The dobutamine was
weaned to off on 11 of January He was restarted on IV Lasix.
On 25 of August , patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% mid LAD lesion , 40% OM , 40% RCA. His pressures showed an RA
pressure of 10 , RV 50/12 , with a mean PA pressure of 34 , a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , cardiac output 3.0 , with
an index of 1.6 , SVR 1800. It was therefore felt that his
cardiomyopathy which had initially been attributed to ischemic
etiology , was likely idiopathic or secondary to alcohol. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the KH with Swan-Ganz
catheter in place. He was again treated with dobutamine and
Isordil and his captopril was titrated upwards. Repeat echo showed
an ejection fraction of 20% with an unstable LV thrombus. He was
subsequently restarted on heparin , followed by loading with
Coumadin. He was transferred back to the floor on 2 of February and
remained hemodynamically stable on captopril , Isordil , amiodarone ,
digoxin and aspirin. His Lasix intravenous was converted to p.o.
torsemide with good fluid balance.
2. Neurology. The patient was noted to complain of
lightheadedness , vertigo and ringing in his ears after receiving
his doses of captopril. He underwent noninvasive carotids which
showed a subtotal occlusion of his right internal carotid artery.
He underwent combined cardiac catheterization and carotid
angiography on 11 of January Angiography revealed a greater than 90% right
internal carotid stenosis. Following the procedure , he had a
transient 5-10 minute episode of decreased responsiveness and
decreased left hand grip , which resolved completely. On 30 of January ,
he underwent right carotid endarterectomy complicated by a small
right neck hematoma which resolved spontaneously. He had no
further symptoms and was able to tolerate captopril up to 25 mg
t.i.d.
3. Hematology. The patient was anticoagulated with heparin
followed by Coumadin as above , for his LV thrombus , with a target
INR of 2.5 to 3.
4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Patient&apos;s blood
sugars were well controlled on p.o. glyburide.
5. Renal. Patient&apos;s creatinine on admission was 1.4. His
creatinine transiently rose to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis , but
fell to 1.4 on discharge.
The patient was discharged home with VNA services on 23 of March He
was stable on discharge. He is to follow up with Dr. Seth Scheirman on 10 of February
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.day , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,

R. knee , and was unable to ambulate. C/o radiation into posterior knee;
denies any trauma. In ED , afebrile , VSS , knee noted to be mildly
swollen and focally tender. Had R. knee films , which showed a large
joint effusion , lateral subluxation of her patella , no fracture , and
intact prosthetic hardware. Seen by ortho service , who felt that joint
was not septic , recommended pain control and discharge home with
outpatient ortho follow-up. Pt was seen by PT service , patient unable to

Discharge Date: 11/10/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hora is a 45 year old woman
with hypertensive disease , as well as
diabetes , who presents with sustained chest pain and shortness of
breath. The patient has long standing obesity with moderate to
severe hypertension which has been fairly well controlled and
poorly controlled diabetes , as well as atypical chest pain and
asthma. Over the last four days she has had increased episodes of
rather persistent chest discomfort , shortness of breath. She
generally describes it in her anterior chest wall as pressure , but
there is also some sharp qualities as well. The patient has also
noted increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea without subjective
wheezing and there has been an increase in her orthopnea. The
patient is unsure of whether her shortness of breath correlates
with her chest pressure. Previous evaluation has included several
negative exercise tolerance tests , but there was in 1981 an
exercise tolerance test with Thallium that showed a fixed anterior
profusion defect and an EKG has chronic anterolateral Q wave to
poor R wave progression. An echo in 1991 showed LVH with no
regional wall motion abnormalities. The patient was admitted for
rule out MI three months prior to this admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Asthma. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes
mellitus. 4. Obesity. 5. Sleep apnea.
6. Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Codeine which produces
nausea.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: 1. Diabetes mellitus. 2. Hypertension.
3. Family history of CAD. 4. No tobacco.
5. No hypercholesterolemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Hysterectomy vaginally.
2. Status post an umbilical hernia repair.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Azmacort , Proventil , Tagamet , Cardizem 300
q.day , insulin NPH 40 units q.AM and 55
units q.PM. , aspirin , Motrin , Maxide 1 per day , Lisinopril 20 mg
p.o. q.day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , heart rate 100 ,
respiratory rate 20 , blood pressure was
140/80 , oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. She was an obese
black female lying in the bed at 45 degrees with nasal cannula in
no acute distress. Her head was normocephalic atraumatic. Pupils
were equal and round to light and accommodation. Her extraocular
movements were full. Cranial nerves were intact. There were no
oral lesions. There was minimal jugular venous distention. Chest
was clear. Heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. There was no CVA tenderness. There was some
chest wall tenderness on the left. The abdomen was obese and
non-tender , with bowel sounds present. There was no cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. There was no proprioceptive defects.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories on admission showed her to have a
potassium of 3.7 , BUN and creatinine of 11/1.2 ,
creatinine kinase of 148 , troponin of 0.0. Chest x-ray was clear
with no evidence of left ventricular failure. EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm at 90 with Q waves/poor R wave progression in I , III ,
IV , which was no acute change from the most recent EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with serial CPK , as well as
serial troponin , both of which showed 0.0. The patient also
underwent a VQ scan given her sedentary life style to rule out
pulmonary embolus , and in fact it was very low probability. The
patient at that point was managed by the addition of a
gastrointestinal regimen of Prilosec and Cisapride as she had
complained of some worsening of her chest pressure when she laid
back flat and some sour taste in her mouth. The patient reported
that this combination of medications made her feel somewhat better.
The patient finally underwent an exercise tolerance test with MIBI
10/1/96. She went 5 minutes and 0 seconds on a Bruce protocol ,
stopped secondary to chest pain. Her peak heart rate was 140 ,
which is 85% of predicted. Her systolic maximum was 120. The
chest pressure was similar to that on admission and it was somewhat
atypical and ill defined. The patient then had MIBI images which
showed a borderline to minimal anterior reversible defect , but that
was as said borderline. The patient was deemed suitable for
discharge after conversation with Dr. Dubin of the Cardiology
Service , and the patient will be following up with her primary care
doctor. The medication changes will be the addition of Prilosec
and Cisapride in the place of Axid AND the addition of isordil 10mg po tid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil 2 puffs inhaler q.i.d. , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , NPH 40
units q.AM and 55 units subcu q.PM. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.day ,
Maxide 1 tablet p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 1 tablet sublingual
q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o.
q.day , Azmacort 4 puffs inhaler b.i.d. , Cardizem CD 300 mg p.o.
q.day , Cisapride 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and isordil 10 mg po tid.

Discharge Date: 11/24/2005
ATTENDING: FABROQUEZ , COY MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cough , nausea , vomiting , and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , CHF , and COPD who was admitted
on 2/21/05 after presenting to the emergency department
complaining of three weeks of feeling unwell. The patient states
that approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developed
increased lower extremity edema. She also noted increased cough
and shortness of breath. Approximately two weeks prior to the
admission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement in
her symptoms. About one week prior to the admission , she began
to have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to
have cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening
prior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which
radiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two
sublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency
department the following day complaining of shortness of breath
and fatigue.
In the emergency department , the patient&apos;s vital signs were noted
to be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98%
on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and
fatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to
77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids ,
approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she
developed wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she
became more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure
continued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure
support. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and
she was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime
showed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In
addition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.
She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary
edema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was
transferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac
cath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA
to the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all
the other grafts were occluded. No interventions were
undertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and
left-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean
pulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also
noted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small
amounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac
output , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with
sodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a
brisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram
obtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be
akinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global
right ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She
was also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with
severe mitral regurgitation.
Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one
drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she
was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin
for Coag-negative staph bacteremia. She was also diagnosed with
a UTI and started on levofloxacin. She was eventually extubated
on 11/18/05. She was discharged from the CCU on 10/30/05 , and
was accepted on to the Cards Aworth Service.

with her son and grandson in the same house. She is a current
smoker , approximately one-third pack per day. She denies alcohol
and IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sone with schizophrenia.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: CBC showed a white blood cell
count of 6.07 , hematocrit 28.5 , and platelets 274 , 000. INR 2.3.
PTT 42.8 and PT 25.8. Sodium 131 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 87 ,

27 , alkaline phosphatase 66 , and total bili 0.2. CK 141 , MB 8.2 ,
troponin peaked at 4.46 and subsequently trended down.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Following discharge from the Coronary Care
Unit: In summary , the patient is a 64-year-old female , admitted
on 2/21/05 , complaining of subacute progressive symptoms of CHF
in addition to a more acute onset of nausea and vomiting. She
presented to the emergency department hypotensive , which was
probably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake as
well as continued Lasix use. When given IV fluids , she went into
flash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the CCU and
intubation. The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed no
new intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. She was
admitted to the CCU where she was aggressively diuresed and
weaned of the vent. She was transferred to the floor on
4/13/05.
Her hospital course by system is as follows.
Cardiac ischemia. The patient underwent catheterization on
2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the SVG to RCA graft ,
60% obstruction in the RIMA to the marginal 1 graft , patent LIMA
to the LAD , and patent SVG to OM1 and OM2. Note was made of
markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. No
stents were placed. We continued management of her ischemia with
aspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. In addition , we
started an ACE inhibitor , which had been initially held due to
her hypotension. This was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterload
reduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. Over the
course of her CCU stay and her hospital stay on the Cardiac
Service , she continued to clinically improve. We felt that her
mitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her CHF flare
and ischemia. We would recommend outpatient echo for further
follow-up of her mitral regurgitation.
Rhythm. The patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , on Coumadin. Here , she was noted to be in normal
sinus rhythm. Her Coumadin dose was held for two nights from
10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned TEE echo and a small dose of
vitamin K was given. Subsequently , the TEE was later canceled.
We are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose of
Coumadin , but her INR may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitamin
K. We have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for an
INR check.
Infectious disease. The patient was noted to have two positive
cultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and one
drawn on 5/29/05. She was initially started on vancomycin on
2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on her
sensitivities. The plan was to obtain a TEE to evaluate her for
endocarditis. However , on further review of the sensitivity , we
conclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negative
staph species. We feel that this most likely represents
contamination rather than true bacteremia. This was discussed
with the ID fellow who agreed with our assessment. Therefore ,
the TEE was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.
We asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultures
checked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.
The patient also had a positive UA while in the CCU and was
started on levofloxacin for a UTI. However , her urine cultures
never grew an organism. So , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.
Pulmonary. The patient has a history of COPD. She was continued
on her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. She
received one course of pulse dose steroids while in the CCU for
presumed COPD infection. This was discontinued prior to her
admission to the floor.
Renal. On presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renal
failure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. However , this improved
with diuresis. She also had an MRI of the kidneys to evaluate
for renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. This showed severe
diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but no
renal artery stenosis. The radiologist recommends a CT angiogram
for further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.
Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on
Lantus and metformin at home. Here , we held her metformin dose
and treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.
We have asked the patient to restart her metformin upon
discharge.
FEN. The patient&apos;s goal in&apos;s and out&apos;s should be even to -500 ml
per day. We increased her home Lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80
mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. These doses should be
subsequently adjusted to maintain her volume status as an
outpatient.
Code. Status is full code.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home on 1/7/05 with
VNA Services. VNA should assist the patient with her medications
as well as volume status checks , daily weights , and lung exams.
She has a follow-up appointment already scheduled with her
primary care doctor , Dr. Wagenheim , on 9/29/05 at 2:30 p.m. In
addition , Dr. Rayome of the Cardiology Service will see
the patient as an outpatient. The exact appointment time and
date are pending at the time of this dictation. The office has
indicated that they will call the patient for a specific
appointment time.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
2. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: CHEST PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Dube is a 58-year-old female
status post stent to her left
circumflex coronary artery three months prior to admission , with a
history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia ,
hypertension , who presents with left jaw pain for the last several
days. She treated this at home with sublingual nitroglycerin with
partial relief of her pain. She presented to the emergency room
and had full resolution of her jaw pain with three sublingual
nitroglycerin. Of note , when the patient presented with a non-ST
elevation MI approximately three months prior , she also had left
jaw pain. Since this pain was the patient&apos;s classic anginal pain ,
heparin was started despite the fact that she had negative cardiac
enzymes and no EKG changes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary
artery disease status post left circumflex stent in April 2002.
Anxiety , depression , left arm phlebitis associated with blood draws
after her left circumflex stent was placed. Status post
appendectomy , status post tubal ligation.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Glucophage , Lipitor , atenolol , aspirin , sublingual
nitroglycerin p.r.n. , Zestril , Celexa , Klonopin ,
Neurontin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a daughter who works for Erdar Y University Hospitals She does not smoke nor does she drink
alcohol. Her primary language is Spanish.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease. The
patient&apos;s father died of a myocardial infarction
at age 62 and her mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 75.
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 100-137/52-67 , pulse 60-62 ,
respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 97-98% on two
liters nasal cannula.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Well appearing middle-aged female.
NECK: JVP flat. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular
rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. CHEST: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No lower extremity edema ,
warm. RECTAL: The patient is guaiac negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular. The patient was
taken for cardiac catheterization
after she was admitted. Her cardiac catheterization was on
April , 2003. Prior to her catheterization she was enrolled in
the Nacan Cajord General Hospital This was a blinded trial with Permsan Madiston Ni Hospital inhibitor. In accordance with the trial , the patient was
started on Lovenox 1 mg per kg subcutaneously b.i.d. Later that
afternoon on April , 2003 , she went for cardiac catheterization.
The cath revealed a right dominant system with no significant left
main lesions , no significant left anterior descending lesions , 70%
diffuse lesion in the left circumflex artery consistent with
instant restenosis of her previously placed PIXEL stent. The right
coronary artery showed a 30% lesion. During this catheterization ,
brachytherapy to the vessel that showed instant restenosis was
attempted , however , it was aborted due to technical malfunction of
the brachytherapy delivery machine. The lesion was , however ,
dilated by balloon angioplasty. After dilatation there was TIMI-3
flow with 10% residual stenosis.
Postcath the patient did well. She was maintained on aspirin ,
Zocor , Lopressor , captopril , Celexa , Klonopin which are her home
medications. The morning after catheterization , the patient had
recurrent chest pain which radiated to her right jaw. The pain was
relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. The following day , the
patient did well. However , she began to develop a right groin
hematoma in the afternoon on July , 2003. The hematoma was
thought to be rapidly enlarging. Hematocrit checked at that time
revealed a significant drop in blood count to 26. The patient was
transfused two units of packed red blood cells. Her hematoma
continue to expand overnight. The patient was discontinued from
Lovenox at that time. However , she was continued on aspirin and
Plavix. The patient&apos;s Lovenox was reversed with protamine.
Over the night , the patient&apos;s hematoma continued to expand. She
received , the following morning on March , 2003 , one unit of
fresh frozen plasma as well as a third unit of packed red blood
cells. At that point , her hematoma was marked and it was noted to
be stable from that point on , no longer expanding beyond the bounds
of the marks. Her left arm was noted at that time to also be tense
with hematoma secondary to blood draws. Vascular surgery was
consulted in the morning on March , 2003 , in order to assess the
right groin hematoma as well as the hematoma in the left arm due to
concern for developing compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery saw
the patient and felt that as long as the patient&apos;s hematocrit
stabilized , she would not need any surgical intervention. They
could not find any evidence for left upper extremity compartment
syndrome at that time.
Also on the morning of March , 2003 , the patient&apos;s platelets
agents including both Plavix and aspirin were discontinued.
Further family history was obtained from the patient that day which
revealed history suspicious for possible bleeding disorder
including the information that the patient&apos;s daughter bleeds
heavily with each menstrual period , and that both the patient and
her daughter have very easy bruising with history of several
hematomas secondary to light trauma. The patient also reported
that she had heavy bleeding with childbirth that required extra
hospitalization although it did not require a transfusion.
Hematology was consulted at that point. The patient was thought by
hematology to have these hematomas secondary to over
anticoagulation with Lovenox , Plavix , aspirin and possible STONDE MEDICAL CENTER
trial drug with a Kenda Medical Center The only familial
coagulation problems that were screened for based on their
recommendations were von Willebrand screen as well as a Factor XIII
screen. The Factor XIII screen eventually turned out normal and
the von Willebrand screen was pending at the time of discharge.
By the morning of August , 2003 , the patient had received a total
of five units of packed red blood cells due to blood loss secondary
to this hematoma. Her hematoma had stabilized at that time. She
was restarted on aspirin on August , 2003. From that point
onward , the patient did quite well and was maintained on aspirin ,
beta-blocker , Zocor and ACE inhibitor.
The remainder of her hospitalization was uncomplicated and after
the patient had a stable hematocrit for several days without any
recurrent jaw pain , she was discharged home on January , 2003.
Neurology. On August , 2003 , the patient developed a headache
which she described as the same as she frequently experiences at
home. Her headaches are usually not responsive to Tylenol or other
analgesics. Given the patient&apos;s complications with hematoma and
bleeding , a head CT was obtained that afternoon to rule out
intracerebral hemorrhage. Her head CT was negative for bleeding.
Her headache was treated with Tylenol to which it did not respond
and later with Percocet to which she got some relief.

Discharge Date: 11/10/2004
ATTENDING: JAIME GASTELLO MD
SERVICE:
Renal Transplant Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
End-stage renal disease. The patient was admitted for a living
unrelated renal transplant.
LIST OF PROBLEM:
1. End-stage renal disease.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Obstructive sleep apnea.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary
artery disease , hypertension , and end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis for two months that presented for a living unrelated
renal transplant.
ALLERGIES:
The patient reported vertigo to lisinopril and prednisone.
However , prednisone was given on this admission , and he did not
have a problem.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM BY REPORT:
The patient&apos;s temperature was 98.0 , blood pressure 148/60 , pulse
67. In general , a pleasant obese male in no acute distress. His
skin was dry and intact. His HEENT exam demonstrated PERRLA ,
EOMs intact. No icterus , neck was without bruits. He had no
palpable lymph nodes. His heart was regular rate and rhythm
without murmurs. Lungs were clear to auscultation. His abdomen
was obese with a midline incision. His extremities demonstrated
no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. He had a left forearm
hemodialysis axis. He had 5/5 strength in both his upper and
lower extremities. He had 5/5 strength in his hands. His neuro
exam demonstrated he is alert and oriented x3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. The patient was in end-stage renal disease and had a living
unrelated renal transplant from his friend. A detailed
description of the procedure can be found in his dictated
operative report. There were no complications. His kidney had
good urine output during his postoperative course. His
creatinine continued to trend down even on his days of discharge.
His creatinine was within a normal range prior to his discharge.
He had some volume overload secondary to the large amount of IV
fluids that he received , however , after minimal diuresis he
responded with high urine outputs. His immunosuppression
included Thymoglobulin , tacrolimus , a steroid taper , and
CellCept. His allograft was functioning well.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation postoperatively. He was evaluated by the Cardiology
Service. They interrogated his pacer and found that he was in
fact in atrial fibrillation. After 48 hours , the Cardiology
Service considered anticoagulation. Because he had a history of
a GI bleed , it was decided that he would not undergo
anticoagulation. The patient&apos;s heart rate throughout this period
was within the normal range because he was V-paced.
3. Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient had a history of apnea
and was given a standard home therapy with CPAP at night.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
KEY FEATURES OF PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was awake and alert in no distress. His neuro exam
was nonfocal. Abdomen: Obese , soft , nondistended , with an
incision that was clean , dry , and intact.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

Final Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation
Treatment and Response:
Note that it was very difficult to monitor her fluid status -JVP
difficult 2/2 girth of neck , often incontinent so I/O inaccurate , and has
chronic leg edema 2/2 PVD. Therefore , we adjusted diuretic regimen
primarily by how she symptomatically felt and her weights.
Initially treated with Torsemide 200 iv bid , Zaroxylyn 5 mg po bid
( 30 min before torsemide ) , and Aldactone 25 po bid. She diuresed well to
this. Over the course of hospital stay , her creatinine increased
from 1.6 to 2.2 , and though her baseline is 1.6-2.0 , we used this , along
with her symptomatic improvement and return of weight to dry weight of
114.5 kg , to establish euvolemia. For final 3 days of stay on
home regimen of torsemide 150 po bid , zaroxlyn 5 po qd , and
aldactone 25 po bid and had stable weights.
Relevant Data: Weight at d/c 114.5; VS @ d/c 98.0 , 81 , 106/60 , 20 ,

Brief Hospital Course:
See above for CHF related info
In addition , pt was found to have pan-sensitive E-coli UTI - treated with
Bactrim x 7 days. Two days before discharge her initial cough worsened
in severity and became somewhat productive. She never mounted a WBC ,
never was febrile , and CXR showed no infiltrate. Felt to be 2/2
underlying COPD - improved significantly with nebulizer tx and
Robitussen. During hospital stay , she was evaluated for home 02;
however , her ambulatory 02 sat was 94% and her nocturnal O2 sats ( done by
respiratory therapy ) were 89-93%. Therefore , not discharged on home 02 ,

ATTENDING: MOLIMA , ISSAC M.D.
ATTENDING SURGEON: Hassan Fail , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Chronic atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Chronic atrial fibrillation ,
atrial flutter , and ablation.
MEDICATION PROBLEMS: Include ,
1. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter left sided , status
post atrial fibrillation ablation attempt x1 , and atrial flutter
ablation x4 , transesophageal echo in 6/24 showed that atrial
appendage thrombus and trace mitral regurgitation.
2. Hyperprolactinemia.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Chest CT in 9/19 showed multiple tiny nodules in the right
upper lobe that needed to be followed up in 6-12 months.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old
male with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter , status post multiple cardioversion and failed ablations ,
admitted electively for repeat ablation of his atrial flutter.
He was initially diagnosed with atrial fibrillation about 12
years ago and had multiple failed cardioversion and medication
trials. He underwent several atrial fibrillation ablations ,
which ultimately all failed. Overtime his atrial fibrillation
has become atrial flutter possibly due to scarring of the atrial
wall and repeated ablations. When he was first diagnosed with
atrial fibrillation he was started on Coumadin , but that gave him
skin necrosis around his right scapular region. He had been all
the anticoagulants until 6/24 when during transesophageal echo
for planned ablation he was found to have a left atrial appendage
clot. He was first started on Lovenox , which caused large
ecchymosis , which prompted him to switch anticoagulation the
fondaparinux. He now lived persistently in atrial flutter. His
weight controlled with acebutolol. His physical activity has
somewhat decreased and he occasionally gets short of breath ,
epigastric discomfort , and palpitations. He was admitted on
7/6/06 for planned atrial flutter ablation by Dr. Bockemehl and
Dr. Caddle However , a preprocedure transesophageal echo
again demonstrated a left atrial appendage thrombus despite being
on fondaparinux , instead the patient underwent permanent atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter surgery , which included a fourth
sternotomy and ablation of atrial fibrillation with COX III Maze
with cryoablation and cut and sew resection of the left and right
atrial appendages and closure of a patent foramen ovale.
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Included Lipitor 40 mg orally daily ,
acebutolol 200 mg orally daily , bromocriptine 7.5 mg orally
daily , and fondaparinux 10 mg subcutaneously daily.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no tobacco use , no alcohol
abuse , and no illicit drug use.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to quinidine , Coumadin to
which he has a skin necrosis allergy , flecainide which he has
questionable syncope , and amiodarone in which he developed
abnormal liver function test.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was alert and oriented x3.
He was in no acute distress. His lungs are clear bilaterally to
auscultation. His cardiovascular exam demonstrated regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. There were no murmurs , rubs ,
or gallops. His abdomen was obese. Bowel sounds are positive.
His abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were warm.
There was no edema. Skin: There was no rashes. Neuro exam was
nonfocal.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: On 1/7/06 , the patient underwent
fourth sternotomy ablation of atrial fibrillation with COX III
Maze with cryoablation and cut and sew resection of the left and
right atrial appendages , closure of patent foramen ovale.
Surgery was performed by Dr. Rosendo Schwabauer
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES: The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on 8/9/06 , which showed that he was right heart
dominant that the left main coronary artery had no significant
lesions. The left anterior descending artery had no significant
lesion. The left circumflex artery proximally showed a tubular
25% lesion and the right coronary artery showed no significant
lesions with a mid tubular 40% lesion in the RTLV-VR.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Cardiovascular: Rhythm for
persistent atrial flutter , the patient was unable to go right
flutter ablation at present given his left atrial appendage clot
on transesophageal echo. Therefore , his rate was controlled with
his home medication acebutolol until surgery was performed on
1/7/06 , which included a fourth sternotomy ablation of atrial
fibrillation with COX III Maze with cryoablation , and cut and sew
resection of the left and right atrial appendages , and closure of
patent foramen ovale. There were no complications after the
surgery. The patient was discharged on 1/3/06.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Temperature was 99.9 , heart rate 58 ,
blood pressure 104/96 , and he was sating 96% on 1.5 liters. He
was in sinus rhythm. Cardiovascular wise: He had regular , rate ,
and rhythm. His lungs were clear bilaterally. His extremities
were warm. There was 1+ ankle edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Included acebutolol 200 mg orally daily ,
bromocriptine 7.5 mg orally daily , aspirin 325 mg orally daily ,
fondaparinux 10 mg subcutaneously daily , calcium chloride slow
release 20 mEq orally twice a day , Lasix 40 mg orally twice a
day , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 10 mg orally
daily , Motrin 600 mg orally q.6 h. as needed for pain , and Zocor
40 mg orally at nighttime daily.
DISPOSITION: He was stable upon discharge and had followup with
Dr. Jeffers in Cardiovascular Clinic , advanced directive. The
patient is full code.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery
disease , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and hyperlipidemia. He
recently presented to Clinch University Medical Center on 10/18/04 with loss of
consciousness while driving a motor vehicle. He sustained a
left-sided rib fracture. He denies chest pain , shortness of
breath that time. CT scan of the head performed and was
negative. His EKG was consistent with a right bundle-branch
block , but no acute changes. His Persantine testing was
performed and they suspect reversible anterior wall apical
ischemia. He underwent a cardiac catheterization today , which
showed triple vessel disease. He developed complaints of chest
pain post-catheterization with ST depressions , which resolved
with nitroglycerin and Lopressor. He was started on heparin and
nitroglycerin drip and admitted by the cardiology service. CABG
was scheduled by Dr. Vannorden Trauma Service was consulted to
clear him for surgery. Urology also was consulted due to recent
onset of hematuria and extensive neurological history.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , diabetes mellitus ,
hypercholesterolemia , triple AAA , coronary artery disease , left
rib fractures , bladder carcinoma , and adrenal adenoma on CT scan
of the abdomen from an outside hospital.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
He was admitted , he was made ready for surgery , and was taken to
the operating room on 10/20/04 , at which time he underwent an off
pump coronary artery bypass graft x2 with LIMA to the LAD ,
saphenous vein graft to the RCA. His intraoperative findings
showed that he would need a stent to his OM2 at a later date. He
also will need an EP study prior to discharge. He also would
need aspirin and Plavix. He is transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in a stable fashion. He was extubated. He was ready for
transfer to Step-Down Unit by postoperative day #1.
Neurologically , he was intact. Cardiovascular: He was getting
Lopressor 5 mg IV q.4h. His heart rate was 80 to 90. His
systolic blood pressure was 90 to 100. Respiratory: He was
extubated within five hours postoperative. He was on 4 liters
with sats in the high 90s. GI: He was n.p.o. pending his speech
and swallowing evaluation due to his age. Renal: He was
diuresing well. Urology was following. He required bladder
flushes and his urine became cloudy and the Foley was to remain
in. He was on aspirin and Plavix was to be started. On
postoperative day #2 , his chest tubes were removed. His
epicardial pacing wires were left in and EP was evaluating him
for an AICD secondary to his preoperative syncopal episodes.
Cardiology was following for his need for his stent , which they
recommended him having done as an outpatient in one month after
discharge. The Foley was still in secondary to his hematuria.
On postoperative day #3 , his wires were removed. He went into
atrial fibrillation a short time later. He was titrating up on
his Lopressor. He spoke with the Urology , and he was cleared to
have a __________ follow up with Dr. Horwath in one to two weeks.
On postoperative day #4 , he had an echo done , which revealed an
EF of 55% with trace MR and trace TR , inferior basal hypokinesis.
On postoperative day #5 , his creatinine was up to 1.6. He was
off Motrin and Lasix. He was decreased to his loading 20 without
difficulty and was sating 91% on room air with ambulation and
started on his preoperative captopril for hypertension to 160
systolically. The patient did well and he was found suitable to
discharge to rehabilitation on 6/23/04.

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 47 with ST elevations in V2 and V3
and biphasic T waves and aVL. Chest x-ray is normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 8/24/06 and underwent cardiac
catheterization with results as previously described. He also
underwent echocardiogram on 11/8/06 , which estimates ejection
fraction at 60% and finds trivial mitral insufficiency , trivial
tricuspid insufficiency , and mild left atrial enlargement. The
patient was taken to the operating room on 10/13/06 where he
underwent CABG x5 with LIMA to LAD and a sequential graft of SVG1
connecting the aorta to PDA and then LVB1. Left radial artery
connects to D1 and then OM1. The patient was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit following surgery in stable condition. He
was extubated later on his operative day and was noted to have a
slight
rise in his MB fraction. He was started on dopamine on
postoperative day #2 for low blood pressure and low urine output
as well as rising creatinine. His CK-MB was noted to have peaked
and was trending down. Postoperative day #3 , the patient was
weaned off of dopamine and his creatinine began to
trend down. On postoperative operative day 4 , the patient was
off all drips making good urine and given 1 unit of packed red
blood cells for a low hematocrit. He was transferred to the
Step-Down Unit later that day. At time of transfer , he was
hemodynamically stable and had been started on diltiazem for
spasm prophylaxis of his radial artery graft. The plan was to
avoid hypotension for renal perfusion and up titrate
beta-blockade carefully. He was saturating well on room air and
his diet was being advanced and was well tolerated. His
creatinine had fallen at time of transfer to 1.6 from its peak of
2.4 and continued to improve to its baseline levels by time of
discharge. The patient was followed perioperatively by the
Diabetes Management Service for glycemic control. He continued
to progress daily , remained in sinus rhythm and on room air for
the duration of his stay. His creatinine remained at baseline
level of 1.6. He continued to ambulate without problems and
was discharged home in good condition on postoperative day #7 on
the following medications: Diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be
continued for three months postoperatively for radial artery
graft , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , NovoLog insulin 8 units
subcutaneously at 8:00 a.m. , Lantus insulin 40 units
subcutaneously at 10:00 p.m. , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily ,
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n.
pain , Zocor 80 mg p.o. nightly , NovoLog insulin 4 units
subcutaneously with lunch and supper.
The patient is to have
follow-up appointments with his cardiologist , Dr. Luckner , in one to
two weeks and with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Harclerode , in four to
six weeks.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Aortic valve area evaluation HPI
admitted for aortic valve evaluation via catherization. This patient was
scheduled to have cystoscopy and bladder intervention for a possible
bladder cancer as well as TURP at Whee Hospital on 2/1/2006. His
surgeon wanted a pre-surgical cardiac evaluation given this history of
AS. The patient has had not changes in his functional activity recently.
Of note , his past history is notable for 5/23 with a right hemispheric
ischemic stroke. He has been having a gradual recovery: there is no
sensitivity in the left leg , though the motor deficits have improved and
he is able to walk with a walker. When he really exerts himself , he had
episodes of SOB but no chest pain , palpitations , presyncope or syncope.
He does have an unclear history of orthopnea but it might not be of a
cardiac etiology. Of note his activity has not been limited by any
cardiac complaints.

Hospital course: 61y.o M w/ CAD , s/p MI w/ 4 vessel CABG who presented
presenting with CP and pressure , lightheadedness and SOB x 3days. Sx c/w
unstable angina vs. coronary vasospasm vs. incisional/pleuritic pain s/p
CABG.
--CV: Patient admitted w/ sx of SOB , SSCP and pressure , diaphoresis ,
lightheadedness that lasted 5-15 minutes per episode , did not radiate
other than to abdomen , very concerning for ACS vs. unstable angina ,
especially in the setting of known CAD and recent 4-vessel CABG ( SH : BCH
-&gt; 1st diagonal and then to LAD , L radial artery anastomosis to distal
RCA , L saphenous vein to left circumflex first major marginal; post
surgery SSUH echo w/ EF of 43% and some basilar hypokinesis , patient
started on amiodarone for bigeminy ). Dressler&apos;s less likely at this time
out from post-op.
( I ) In the ED , the EKG on admission showed NSR , 1-2 mm ST elevations in
leads V1-V3 , T wave inversions in V4-V6 , concerning for acute cardiac
process. No comparison EKG for baseline so unable to ascertain if new
ischemia or if ACS in setting of sx. Patient rec&apos;d ASA , nitro x3 w/
relief and 2 mg morphine in ED. CXR was performed showing bilateral
effusions w/ L&gt;R. Enzyme set A was negative. Patient was admitted to
floor , where a repeat EKG was done , which showed changes from his prior
EKG , specifically a new T wave inversion in V3 and trigeminy with PVCs.
Patient reported mild pain at this time. Signs &amp; symptoms were
concerning enough for ACS that the patient was started on a heparin drip
of 1000cc/hr with a loading bolus of 5000 units and his PTT followed.
Home isosorbide was held to ascertain for pain. Records were requested
from Wickstra Hospital , where the patient had his surgery 1 month ago.
Patient was put on telemetry and his home Lipitor was increased to 80
mg , and his home lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg TID. Overnight he was
pain free , and r/o&apos;d by enzymes x 3. His telemetry showed NSR w/
occasional trigeminy and PVCs. Pain may be incisional or anginal ,
lightheadedness most likely patient&apos;s anginal equivalent. Cardiology was
consulted to consider the indications for catheterization and risk of ACS.
The patient was asx 10/3 and noted to have some sternal incisional pain
with palpation , no EKG changes observed. Reccomendations were made to send
the patient to ETT-MIBI 4/12 , check fasting am lipids , d/c home amiodarone
from RH for his ? arrythmia. The patient was also started on Lisinopril
5mg at this time and his heparin drip was d/c&apos;d. ETT-MIBI showed no signs
of reversible ischemia , basal wall hypokinesis but which was knwon on
admission. Fasting cholesterol was unable to be sent 2/2 to am MIBI
schedule. Should be tested as outpatient.
( P ): No signs of pump dysfunction though mildly elevated jvp of 6-8cm on
admission , EF post-CABG at LMVH was 43%. Repeat echo was ordered to assess
function though cancelled in setting of unremarkable MIBI and absence of of
sx and signs failure while in house.
( R ): Alternates between NSR and trigeminy with PVCs. Amiodarone from TH
d/c&apos;s as not needed for this rhythym.
--Renal: h/o hematuria at MMH , microhematuria on U/A and urine sed on
admission. Will require outpatient follow up. Per LAH noted he would need
renal bx and follow-up though it does not seem appropriate w/ h/o foley and
hematuria. Cystoscopy seems more relevant. We consulted the patient&apos;s PCP
and agree to recommend outpatient urology follow-up over renal. Urine
cytology was ordered and collected ( though some lost to collection during
MIBI ). Can be followed as outpatient.
--Pulm: cxr w/ bilateral effusions L&gt;R but which are consistent with a
setting of recent cardiac surgery. Patient noted + SOB w/ pain. PE
unlikely as infection. Exam resolved slightly over course of stay.
PPx: Pt on heparin drip w/ ? of ACS on 9/9 , lovenox held. Haprin d/c&apos;d 10/3
in pm. Lovenox held as patient ambulatory and to home on 4/18

Discharge Date: 1/4/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DEHYDRATION.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1 ) DIABETES MELLITUS.
2 ) HYPERTENSION.
3 ) DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
4 ) SLEEP APNEA.
5 ) CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
6 ) GOUT.
7 ) GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE.
8 ) ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year-old woman
with a history of heart failure ,
preserved ejection fraction , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
obstructive sleep apnea , mild pulmonary hypertension who had an
increase in Torsemide dose from 100 mg b.i.d. to 180 mg b.i.d. She
also was subsequently started on Zaroxolyn two days prior to
admission. She has felt increasingly tired and light headed
without dyspnea. She has had a very dry mouth. She has also noted
a decline in urine output. She is admitted to the short stay unit
on May , 2000 when her BUN and creatinine were 125 and 4.2
respectively. This compared to a baseline creatinine of about 2.0.
She was admitted for intravenous hydration. She continues to
complain of dizziness when she sits up at the time of admission and
her creatinine has declined from 4.6 to 2.1 off all her medications
and with some mild hydration over the first two days of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Diabetes mellitus. 2 ) Gastroesophageal
reflux disease. 3 ) Gout. 4 ) Congestive
heart failure secondary diastolic dysfunction. 5 ) Diverticulosis
in 1998. 6 ) Obstructive sleep apnea. 7 ) Hypertension. 8 )
Chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of about 2.0. 9 )
Anemia of chronic disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Morphine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She has five children and
two foster children. She quit smoking around nine
years ago. She uses a cane with walking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission was
significant for chest examination which was
clear. Cardiac examination was muffled , but you could hear an S4 ,
S1 and S2 with a jugular venous pressure around 7 cm , positive
hepatojugular reflux , 1+ peripheral edema of both legs.
Extremities were warm and well perfused. Abdomen is obese and
soft. There was no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities.
LABORATORY: EKG showed a left ventricular hypertrophy , first
degree atrioventricular block with a heart rate around
90.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the short
stay unit and was given fluid for two days and
all of her medications were held. She was admitted to the
Cardiology Service , however on April , 2000 , she had been inhouse
with that being her fourth day. Her cardiac medications were
progressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. Her course is notable for progressive decline in her
BUN and creatinine. On April , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at
10 mg b.i.d. She came in on 20 mg b.i.d. She did fine with this.
The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her dose
of Lisinopril. This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinine
back up to around 2.8 from 1.9. Because she diuresed a total of
about 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increase
dose of Lisinopril. We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. and
continued her Torsemide. The patient&apos;s BUN and creatinine
stabilized then at 63 and 2.8. Because of this response to
Lisinopril , we performed a renal artery scan with results pending
at the time of this dictation. The patient also at the time of
discharge clearly at her driest considering the medication regimen
that she is on. She is clearly orthostatic this morning. She will
be discharged on 100 mg p.o. Torsemide b.i.d. with before knowledge
that she will drink quite a bit more than she does inhouse. She
will be followed up for her potassium , renal function and renal
artery scan by Dr. Mel Minshall

ATTENDING: KRIEGE , DERRICK M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right thigh burn , cellulitis and diabetic
ketoacidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hesby is a 36-year-old woman
with very poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and extensive end
organ damage including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
right eye blindness , lower extremity neuropathy , gastroparesis
and a history of extensive infections including VRE line sepsis ,
MRSA , abdominal abscesses and chronic dermal ulcers. Due to her
dermal ulcers , she developed left ankle osteomyelitis requiring
below-the-knee amputation. She was transferred from Shiredo Sert Of Valley on 1/24/06 in DKA in the setting of a right thigh burn
and possible infection.
The patient was in her usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when she spilled hot broth on her right thigh
and developed a painful red bullae. She presented to Path Community Hospital two days prior to admission , but still she had an
infection. She was given a prescription for antibiotics , which
she did not fill. The area of swelling in her right leg did not
spread from the original blister area all the way up to her groin
and grossly became more tender and warm. On the day of
admission , she returned to the Threei Cent Hospital Emergency Room
for evaluation. Of note , in going to the emergency room , she
missed her regular hemodialysis. In the Ingsparks Down Health
Emergency room , the following vital signs were noted.
Temperature afebrile , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 150/50 ,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air. WBC 4.3 , hematocrit 38 ,
sodium 126 , potassium 7.9 , glucose 1221 , anion gap 13 , acetone
negative , AST 385 , ALT 127 and alk phos 411. EKG revealed peak Q
waves. The patient was given 20 units of IV insulin and then was
started on an insulin drip 8 units per hour. She also received 2
amps of calcium gluconate as well as Kayexalate and albuterol
nebs. A repeat Chem-7 in the Amoore Medical Center ED showed a glucose of
1100 and an anion gap of 18 with potassium 5.4. The patient was
transferred to the MICU at EH for further management. At the
time of her transfer , she noted left-sided headache , a warm

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. DKA: The patient was stabilized in the MICU on an insulin
drip and was then transferred to General Medicine for further
management. Causes of DKA that were ruled out included the
following - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreatic
enzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. The patient&apos;s DKA
was presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in the
setting of a local burn. She initially was given 500 mL normal
saline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. As she is
aneuric , her boluses were stopped once the blood sugars were
below 500. She initially was placed on insulin drip that was
then transitioned to NPH and finally to Lantus 24 units subcu
daily. Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take both
her long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. As a result , an
endocrinology consult was called. The patient was noted to be
ordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explain
her labile sugars. Despite careful diet and glucose control
efforts , the patient still had sugars at times to the 500s.
Endocrinology continues to leave recommendations about AC
standing insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale and
Lantus insulin. The patient has a history of gastroparesis and
therefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. The patient&apos;s
new covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology.
2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentin
and IV vancomycin. Her area of cellulitis has completely
resolved at the present time with slight sloughing of the
overlying skin. The underlying skin is pink with evidence of
good granulation and no further evidence of infection. Given
that her IV access is very difficult , the patient received some
vancomycin , as she finishes hemodialysis every other day.
3. End-stage renal disease: The patient missed her dialysis on
the day of admission. Once in the hospital , her potassium was
very difficult to control in part due to poor adherence with her
renal diet and in part due to her very labile sugars. At times ,
her potassium would rapidly increase to a level higher than 6.5
requiring urgent dialysis. At the present time , the patient has
been dialyzed daily since her admission. She is closely followed
by renal with plans to continue dialysis while in the hospital.
She should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless she
has evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. Should
she become acidotic , the patient can be managed with sodium
bicarbonate and D5W in small boluses.
4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chest
pain. The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. Her
cardiac enzymes remained negative. Lipids are pending at the
present time. Lipid profile check is pending at the present
time. Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence of
right heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspect
of the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejection
fraction. Her weight on admission was 70 kg. We did not know
her dry weight. Dialysis is helping to manage her fluids given
her aneuric status. Her O2 sats remained stable on room air
throughout the hospitalization. Her hypertension has been
somewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continued
on her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched to
Captopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time.
Rhythm , normal sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on
telemetry with no signs of arrhythmia.
5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on a
cardiac , renal and diabetic diet. She was noted to repeatedly
order extra food from the kitchen supervisor. Nutrition
endocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are working
diligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000
calories per day as specified by her ADA diet. She is continuing
her Nephrocaps and sevelamer. Prophylaxis , heparin 5000 units
subcu t.i.d. - the patient has consistently refused her heparin.
6. Consent: All interventions require consent from the
patient&apos;s medical guardian , Stanley Paneque ( please see number
above ).
7. Code status: The patient is full code and this has been
confirmed with the guardian.
ADDENDUM
Of note , on the night of 10/22/06 , the patient complained of
severe cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. She
noted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea.
Several C. diff studies , which were sent recently have been
negative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.
Presumed cause is Augmentin , which has been stopped. The patient
has continued to eat freely and is passing diarrhea despite her
complaints of 10/10 severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of her
abdomen was ordered , but she refused to take oral or IV contrast.
The results of this CT scan are pending and will be followed up
by the new medical team.

ATTENDING: DAMIAN GRUHN MD
ADDENDUM
Date of discharge is to be determined.
SERVICE:
General Medical Service Bile Port
In summary , this patient is a 73-year-old lady with a history of
low back pain , sciatica , morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,
hypothyroidism , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , posthepatic
neuralgia , rheumatoid arthritis , renal insufficiency , deep vein
thrombosis , bilateral total knee replacement secondary to
degenerative joint disease , who is admitted on 8/15/04 for
worsening low back pain. The following is a continuation of the
hospital events during her stay.
1. Low back pain: As stated before , she suffers from
debilitating low back pain from morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,
rheumatoid arthritis , and degenerative joint disease. During her
hospitalization , her pain was treated with narcotics as well as a
steroid/analgesic epidural injection. The Pain Service followed
during her discharge day. Her pain control with narcotics was
titrated with a fentanyl patch along with breakthrough p.o.
Dilaudid. She was also titrated up on her chronic pain
medications including Neurontin and Elavil. The patient had a
history of sedation with too much narcotics , and her narcotics
should be titrated for mental status changes. During her stay ,
she received IV conscious sedation MRI , which showed a normal
spinal cord and spinal stenosis , facet involvement. Orthopedics
surgery was consulted early during the hospitalization and they
determined that there was no surgical indication for orthopedic
surgery. They were also reconsulted later on when the patient
appeared to want to have surgery , and at that time orthopedics
surgery determined that the risk-benefit ratio was not in favor ,
and that she was not a surgical candidate in the context of a
newly developed right lower extremity DVT. As mentioned before ,
the patient had an epidural injection with bupivacaine and
steroids on 7/8/05 with minimal initial response to her pain.
However , later , there was some improvement in her pain. The
patient is to follow at the Pain Clinic in two weeks , as further
appointments in the follow up section for a possible repeat
epidural injection. In addition , she is to follow up with Dr.
Farella within four weeks of the Orthopedics Surgery Service for
reevaluation for the orthopedics surgery. In addition , she
received aggressive physical therapy , which slowly enabled her to
improve her range of movement in her lower extremities. She does
have chronic and stable left lower extremity immobility.
However , she is able to move her right leg somewhat and this has
improved slowly over time with aggressive PT. The patient has
very agreeable of recent days to physical therapy and is expected
to continue to improve with continued aggressive physical
therapy. This should be the mainstay of her treatment in
addition to her pain control with her medications. She should be
premedicated with Dilaudid or any pain control medications prior
to any physical therapy session.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient had stable cardiovascular
parameters during her admission and did not require any
significant changes in her outpatient medications. Medications
are as listed in the discharge medications.
3. Endocrine: She has severe diabetes mellitus and insulin
resistence. Her NPH was titrated due to episodes of asymptomatic
hypoglycemia to the range of 45 to 55 in the fasting morning
glucoses of normal need. On discharge , the patient was
maintained on NPH insulin b.i.d. as well as sliding scale of
regular insulin. He also had a history of hypothyroidism and her
Synthroid was continued. She had a history of renal
insufficiency and received a chronic low dose of prednisone. She
did not have any issues while she was in the hospital.
4. Rheumatology: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis. Her
prednisone was decreased in duration of her stay from prednisone
20 mg p.o. q.a.m. to 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. She also is on as an
outpatient on her home dose of methotrexate 20 mg p.o. q. week ,
which was held during her hospitalization due to her acute
issues. However , the methotrexate , which was prescribed by her
outpatient rheumatology , should be restarted as an outpatient as
soon as possible. She takes 20 mg p.o. q. week.
5. Renal: Initially , the patient had a mild increase in her
creatinine on presentation , but this improved to the normal range
with gentle hydration.
6. Infectious disease: The patient had a fever on 4/22/04 to
101 and on 6/26/05 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures were
negative. There were white blood cells in her urine and she was
empirically given levofloxacin. She did have cough and sputum ,
and she was found to have MRSA in her sputum and was known to be
colonized at this point , and was placed on precautions. However ,
her chest x-ray was clear. She did not have a clinical
pneumonia. Her lower extremity appeared red and woody and there
was question of cellulitis , and she received 10 days of p.o.
Keflex , although it was unlikely she had two cellulitis.
7. Pulmonary: She likely has obstructive sleep apnea with a
mild decrease in O2 saturations at night. However , this was
never clinically significant. Her body habitus and symptoms were
consistent with obstructive sleep apnea. Chest x-rays were also
taken during her course and were unchanged from her prior.
Although , she has had a history of being fitted for a C-PAP mask ,
she refused to use this.
8. Hematology: She was diagnosed with a DVT in her right leg by
ultrasound on 6/26/05 , and was started on a heparin drip , which
was bridged to warfarin with therapeutic INR during the rest of
her stay. The plan is for her to continue six months of
anticoagulation , then reevaluation by her outpatient primary care
physician. Her current dose of Coumadin is 6 mg p.o. q.h.s. and
this should be checked one week after discharge from the hospital
in order to ensure a goal INR of 2 to 3. Until than she will be
maintained on Lovenox 40 mg subu q.d. in the hospital , and this
can be continued as needed as an outpatient.
9. Physical therapy: As per above , the patient is engaged in
physical therapy and showed improvement over time.
10. GI: The patient has intermittent constipation to her pain
medications and has poor p.o. intake in general , however , this
improved over the course of admission. She requires an
aggressive bowel regimen to keep her regular bowel movements and
she will be often resonant to have a bowel movement due to the
feeling of vertigo during the bowel movements. This , however ,
improved during time. She should be encouraged to allow herself
to have bowel movement in the rest room if she is able. The goal
will be for her to be able to sit on a toilet potty at the
bedside.
11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient had
intermittent , non-clinically significant hyperkalemia , which
initially was corrected with Kayexalate and bowel movements.
12. Psychiatric: The patient had intermittent vocalization of
not caring if she lived or died because she had lived her life
and she was in pain. She was seen by the psychiatry multiple
times. She did not think that she was suicidal and only need
emotional support to which she responded well. At the time of
discharge , she was euthymic and hopeful and was eager to continue
to improve her quality of life with aggressive physical therapy
and pain control. She was looking forward to continuing her pain
control management follow up visit with pain service.
13. The patient has declared herself to be DNR/DNI.
TO-DO PLAN , FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
1. Aggressive physical therapy and pain control , as directed by
the pain clinic and her primary care physician.
2. After her discharge from rehabilitation , she should follow up
with her rheumatologist Dr. Boughamer , pain clinic , Dr. Cills ,
which is her primary care physician in Orthopedics.
3. She is also noted to be MRSA colonized and should be on
appropriate precautions. She should continue her Coumadin for
six months for her deep vein thrombosis until otherwise directed
by the physician. The pain clinic will consider additional
therapy for pain including epidural repeat as an outpatient. The
patient should restart her methotrexate as an outpatient.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
At this time , she has an appointment with Dr. Boore at the
Nardon Hospital Pain Clinic at Mont Ox Delp , phone number
286-351-0157 on 7/9/05 at 2:30 p.m. She also has an
appointment with Dr. Christofferse , Orthopedic Surgery at the Middrise Et Brynta Hospital Orthopedic Service on the Jo Renford Pu
Glenda Li Sabuffta at Park Health , phone number
967-787-5406 on 10/1/05 at 10:30 a.m. She should have her INR
drawn in one week after discharge and follow up INR is to be
drawn every seven days until therapeutic. The INR should be
followed by her rehabilitation/nursing facility.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year white female
with history of positive exercise
tolerance test MIBI , now presents after 12 hours of stuttering
chest pain. Cardiac risk factors include hypertension and high
cholesterol of 220 to 270&apos;s. The patient was generally well until
October 1991 she had an episode of chest pressure. This was a
single episode. On October 1991 , the patient had continued chest
pressure. She had exercise tolerance test MIBI for which she went
3 minutes and 37 seconds with a positive left bundle branch block 3
minutes into exercise. Her MIBI showed a reperfusion defect
anteriorly , inferiorly and septal. A decision was made to
medically manage the patient with beta blockers and sublingual
Nitroglycerins. During this exercise tolerance test MIBI , she was
also noted to have 1 to 2 mm ST depressions in multiple leads. The
patient was active and pain-free until at 10:00 p.m. one day prior
to admission , while walking , she developed pressure across the
chest and between her shoulder blades. She had no shortness of

and went to bed. On the day of admission at 6:30 a.m. , the patient
awoke with chest pain. She checked her blood pressure at home
which was approximately 200/100. She took 100 mg of Atenolol.
Initially , she had increasing chest pain and then this resolved by
approximately 10:30 a.m. She went to the Emergency Room at 1:00
p.m. She described this pain as the same pain that she had in
1991. She did not take any Nitroglycerin because her prescription
was expired. She has had no history of orthopnea , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea or pedal edema. She has no history of chest
pain. She has a history of shortness of breath after walking
upstairs. In the Emergency Room , she was given one Aspirin and she

T-waves in 3 and F , biphasics in V1 through 6. Old EKG not
available but by report is similar.
HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease , status post
angioplasty. The patient is a 70 year
old female admitted with approximately 12 hours of chest pain. She
ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a CPK peak of 786 and MB
fraction of 52. Her echocardiogram examination was within normal
limits with left ventricular function that was normal. She did ,
however , have inferior posterior hypokinesis. Her ejection
fraction was 55%. The patient was on IV Heparin , Aspirin and
Nitropaste as well as a beta blocker. She had no symptoms of chest
pain or shortness of breath. She had exercise tolerance test which
was done approximately 5 to 6 days after her myocardial infarction.
She underwent a modified Bruce protocol for 8 minutes and 40
seconds with chest pain and ST changes. She had 1 minute of left
bundle branch block at the end of her exercise test. The patient&apos;s
exercise test was also notable for her having typical chest pain
similar to her angina. She had up to 2 mm ST depressions. The
test was highly predictive of significant coronary disease. This
exercise test was done on March . The patient went to cardiac
catheterization on May . During this , she was noted to have
significant coronary artery disease. Her second diagonal had a 50%
proximal stenosis. Her mid left anterior descending showed 40%
stenosis. Her first obtuse marginal had 50% proximal stenosis.
Her most distal large obtuse marginal has a 100% stenosis and fills
by left to left bridging collaterals and right to left collaterals.
Her right coronary artery has a 50% proximal stenosis followed by
70% mid stenosis. Her left ventriculogram shows mild inferior ,
posterior hypokinesis with overall preserved chamber size and
function. The calculated ejection fraction was 67%. On October , the patient returned to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory
for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of her right
coronary artery lesion which was 60 to 40% proximally and 80 to 20%
distally. She also had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of her left circumflex of 100% to 20%. Her sheaths
were removed on April in the morning. The patient was
discharged on April with no further complaints of chest pain.
She was not started on Ace inhibitors because her ejection fraction
was very good. She was continued on her beta blocker and Isordil.
The dietician saw the patient with regards to her diet because of
her high cholesterol. She also had post myocardial infarction
teaching done. She will be followed with Cardiac Rehabilitation at
Pa Community Memorial Hospital ( 2 ) Hypertension. The patient had good
control of her hypertension with Procardia. ( 3 ) High cholesterol.
The patient had cholesterol of 239 with HDL 43 , LDL 158. She had
dietician state to her with regards to her high cholesterol ,
however , if this does not work , the patient should be started on acholesterol l
owering medication as an outpatient.

discharge , the patient was on Aspirin PO every day , Atenolol 100 mg
PO q.day , Isordil 30 mg PO t.i.d. , Nifedipine XL 30 mg q.d. PO ,
Nitroglycerin prn. DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to
home. FOLLOW-UP CARE: She will be followed by Cardiac
Rehabilitation at Judetho Hospital She will be followed by Dr. Garret Koeneman in approximately one month. She should have an exercise
tolerance test in three weeks and also have her cholesterol checked
at this time. She will also have a follow-up appointment with Dr.
Tomas Selzler of Cardiology in approximately two weeks. DIET:

alert and oriented x3 , no focal deficits.
Labs on admission were significant for white blood cell count
equal to 12 with 25% bands and 56% polys , troponin on admission
0.19.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ID: The patient&apos;s decreased O2 saturation , chest x-ray
findings were all consistent with a left lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient was started on Levaquin for a seven-day course. The
patient&apos;s Levaquin was discontinued on 1/25/04 after a chest CT
showed no evidence of any further infiltrate in the left lower
lobe. The patient was able to be weaned off of oxygen and was
saturating in the high 90% at the time of discharge. The patient
also underwent urine , blood , and sputum cultures during this
admission , which showed no growth of any organism.
2. Pulmonary: The patient had a history of left upper lobe lung
cancer status post resection. The patient was continued on her
Flovent for management of likely COPD. She underwent a chest CT
during this admission , which showed no evidence a mass or
recurrence of her lung cancer.
3. Ischemia: The patient was found to have a troponin as high
as 23 during this admission and ruled in for a non-NSTEMI in the
setting of hypoxemia. The patient was continued on aspirin ,
statin beta-blocker and Ace inhibitor. She underwent a
dobutamine MIBI on 5/18/05 , which showed areas of periinfarct
ischemia most prominent at the anterior wall. The patient then
underwent a cardiac catheterization on 11/29/05 , which showed
left main disease at 50% as well as tight left circumferential
LAD and a 100% RCA lesion. The patient was then evaluated for
CABG in light of her three-vessel coronary artery disease. Due
to her multiple comorbidities , she underwent a preoperative
evaluation with the chest CT , carotid ultrasound , pulmonary
function test , and echocardiogram. The chest CT revealed no
evidence of lung cancer recurrence. Carotid ultrasound was
significant for bilateral ICA stenosis at 60%-65%. PFT showed an
FEV1 of 1.2 liters or 61% predicted with an FEV1/FVC ratio at 84%
predicted. The echo showed an EF of 55% with mild LVH , mild
hypokinesis of the inferior base and evidence of diastolic
dysfunction. Based on these test results , the patient was deemed
able to undergo CABG. The patient&apos;s surgery was scheduled for
6/19/05. The patient underwent preoperative evaluation by the
cardiac surgery team prior to discharged on 4/29/05.
4. Pump. On admission , the patient was thought to be volume
overloaded given her exam and chest x-ray findings. The patient
was given one dose of Lasix at 20 mg IV and had an adequate
diuresis. The patient was considered euvolemic during the rest
of her admission and required no additional doses of Lasix.
5. Rhythm. The patient was kept on telemetry during this
admission. There were no significant events and no EKG changes
outside of the increasing ST depression as seen on her admission
EKG.
6. Renal: The patient&apos;s initial creatinine on admission was
elevated at 1.6 from her baseline of 1.2. The patient&apos;s
creatinine trended down to 1.36 during the admission and remained
around her baseline until the time of discharge. Her creatinine
was closely monitored after cardiac catheterization and she
received mucomyst and IV fluids at the time of catheterization.
7. Endocrine: The patient was continued on her NPH and sliding
scale insulin during this admission. She was found to have an
enlarged thyroid on chest CT. Her TSH was found to be normal at
3.125. Her thyroid function should be followed as an outpatient.
8. Rheumatology. The patient has a history of PMR and was
continued on her prednisone dose at 10 mg q.d.
9. Code status: The patient remained a full code during this
admission.

45% , prior echocardiogram in Montsair Community Hospital from
1994 reported at 25 to 30% , question alcoholic cardiomyopathy ,
atrial fibrillation. He is status post right MCA CVA while on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular disease ,
history of GI bleed who presented with increased shortness of
breath and cough x several weeks. He noted initial shortness of
breath and nonproductive cough in the end of 9/24 with a
question infiltrate on chest film at that time and the patient
was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics of unknown
content question levofloxacin with no improvement. Since late
9/24 , the patient reports progressive shortness of breath ,
dyspnea on exertion particularly with ambulation of steps and
when lying down. Additionally , the patient reports a vague band
like pain discomfort over left anterior chest particularly
associated with ambulation of steps and when lying supine. Chest
pain is associated with shortness of breath , but denies
lightheadedness , diaphoresis or recent nausea and vomiting.

raising heart rate. He does report orthopnea , denies PND , but
does report intermittent lower extremity swelling. He denies
hematochezia , bright red blood per rectum , hematemesis with
question of melanotic stools over the last month. The patient
also with a history of prior GI bleed while in Lan , West Virginia 39586 several
years prior for which he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells. EGD colonoscopy at that time revealed both upper
and lower GI lesions including several small AVM and
diverticulosis. Additionally , upper GI endoscopy performed at
that time revealed duodenitis.
The patient was seen in a Pleaermount Medical Center today
reportedly in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. He had
previously been reported to be in this abnormal rhtyhm that
converted to normal sinus rhythm while on amiodarone. He was
noted to have rapid ventricular response in 120s. He had
appeared pale. Hematocrit obtained at that time reportedly 21.4

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs on admission include a temperature of 98 , heart rate
of 112 , blood pressure 168/90 , respiratory rate 20 93% on room
air. He was in no acute distress though the patient was seen to
be in shortness of breath when lying at 20 to 30 degrees. JVP on
admission 12 to 15 cm of water , difficult to assess given
habitus. The patient additionally with bibasilar rales ,

LABORATORY DATA:
Laboratory values on admission are significant for creatinine of
1.8 of unknown baseline and glucose of 192. LFTs were within
normal limit. White count of 8.7 , hematocrit of 21.4 , down from
baseline of 30 to 35 and platelets of 351 , 000. MCV on hematocrit
was 84.
EKG on admission showed irregularly regular rhythm at 120 likely

reportedly the patient&apos;s baseline. Chest film with vascular
prominence at the hilum bilaterally , question mass infiltrate
over left lower lobe with no overt effusions.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with extensive past
cardiac and otherwise medical history presenting to the Mahunt Medical Center with CHF exacerbation , anemia with question
GI bleed with hematocrit in the 20s and question
community-acquired pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient with no evidence of acute
coronary syndrome. On admission , the patient was noted to be in
a rapid ventricular response at 120 and with CHF exacerbation.
The patient initially with complaint of chest pressure , which was
concerning for demand ischemia in the setting significant anemia
with increased heart rate and known ventricular dysfunction.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn and serially were elevated with a peak
troponin I of 4. Subsequent serial cardiac enzymes resolved to
baseline values. The patient was initially started on heparin IV
drip for concern for unstable plaque , but following consultation
with Dr. Slaney in Cardiology , it was recommended anticoagulation
be stopped secondary to recent GI bleed and low concern for acute
coronary syndrome versus demand ischemia. Additionally , the
patient was rate controlled with IV following p.o. Lopressor ,
digoxin and amiodarone. Additionally , the patient&apos;s ACE
inhibitor was continued and titrated up to lisinopril 40. The
patient was initially diuresed given significant volume overload
with IV Lasix with diuresis of 4 to 8 liters over the hospital
course. Echocardiogram obtained during decompensated episode
revealed EF of 25 to 30% with global hypokinesis and septal
akinesis , was significantly altered from prior echocardiogram of
9/16/03 obtained at the Wellcamp University Of Medical Center which had
revealed an EF of 40 to 45% with mild global HK. However , of
note , this echocardiogram was similar to prior echocardiogram in
Alehealtdana Bafound Hospital system from 1994 with no additional
wall motion abnormalities. The patient&apos;s cardiovascular issues
felt to stem secondary to anemia in the setting of increased
ventricular response and tachycardia , which led to demand
ischemia and subsequent troponin leak causing decompensated CHF.
The patient&apos;s symptomatology resolved with proper rate control
and resuscitation with IV fluids and blood. The patient&apos;s heart
rate was well controlled in the 60s to 70s and following IV
diuresis , the patient&apos;s CHF symptomatology resolved. At the time
of discharge , the patient was ambulating without difficulty with
no oxygen requirement. The patient was transitioned to all p.o.
regimen.
2. Heme: The patient with recent GI bleed with known both upper
and lower GI lesions including AVM and diverticulosis for which
the patient has been previously treated. The patient&apos;s
hematocrit on admission 21.4. The patient received 4 units of
packed red blood cells to stable hematocrit of 29 to 30 x 72
hours. In addition , the patient was never hemodynamically
unstable during admission. GI bleed felt to be a precipitating
etiology. The patient was seen by the GI Service , was
recommended further outpatient evaluation and upper and lower GI
endoscopy evaluation as required. The patient to follow up with
Dr. Rosendo in the Erpin Medical Center and outpatient EGD
and colonoscopy to be scheduled for the next week or two to
further evaluate. At the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s
hematocrit stable at 29 , no evidence of active GI bleed present.
Additionally , the patient initially held on Coumadin giving
concern for ongoing GI bleed and following stable transfusion ,
the patient&apos;s Coumadin was restarted at initially 5 and then
later 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. with INR goal of 2.8. To be further
evaluated as outpatient and INR to be checked on 5/11/04 in Dr.
Paider office and titration of Coumadin as required.
3. GI: As mentioned prior , the patient with GI bleed , thought
to be precipitating etiology of the patient&apos;s current
hospitalization. The patient maintained on IV Protonix b.i.d.
and transitioned to p.o. Prilosec 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. As
mentioned , prior to GI consult , the patient will receive the
outpatient evaluation with EGD and colonoscopy as required for
further management.
4. Pulmonary: The patient with history of productive cough ,
fevers , chills. On admission , previously treated with course of
antibiotics , presumably Levaquin for presumed community-acquired
pneumonia giving ongoing symptomatology , the patient treated
initially with IV antibiotics including ceftriaxone and
azithromycin transitioned to cefpodoxime and azithromycin. The
patient to complete full 10-day course of antibiotics for
presumed community-acquired pneumonia. At the time of discharge ,
the patient afebrile , ambulating without difficulty , no dyspnea
on exertion and O2 saturation 95% on room air.
5. Psychiatry: The patient with long tobacco history given
extensive cardiovascular status , the patient received addiction
consultation regarding tobacco cessation. Following
consultation , the patient showing good promise regarding tobacco
cessation. He has expressed interest in doing so. As such , the
patient&apos;s antianxiety and depression medications have been
altered. The patient to decrease Zoloft to 25 mg p.o. q.d. from
50 and to continue that for seven days , following which time , he
should discontinue his Zoloft. Additionally , the patient started
on Wellbutrin initially 150 mg p.o. q.d. x seven days , to
transition up to b.i.d. as tolerated within seven days time as
Zoloft is discontinued , recommend further outpatient evaluation
as needed. The patient with several episodes of sundowning
during his hospital course , treated with Haldol with no further
incidents.
6. Endocrine: The patient with known diabetes , maintained on
Regular Insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control. The
patient to continue on outpatient regimen of Avandia and
Glucophage. The patient may require additional anti-glycemic
medications in future as necessary.
7. Renal: The patient with chronicrenal insufficiency on
admission with a creatinine of 1.8 presumed baseline. At the
time of discharge , the patient&apos;s creatinine had resolved to 1.3 ,
thought to be secondary to cardiorenal syndrome in the setting of
acute CHF decompensation , recommend further outpatient management
evaluation. The patient to follow up with Dr. Mcculler in the Lumspe Black Healthcare on 5/11/04 at 1:00 p.m. at which time ,
recommend further evaluation of hematocrit , INR , electrolyte as
required.

Discharge Date: 3/29/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: Diabetes mellitus.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 52 year old male with
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
but no previous coronary artery disease or other cardiac risk
factors , who presented with 24 hours of chest pain he described as
starting on January in the evening , at rest , involving his
entire chest , as well as both arms , without any associated symptoms
of shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting , lightheadedness or
palpitations. He states that the discomfort was constant ,
nonpleuritic and not changed by position. The pain lasted all
night but he was able to sleep through this pain. He had no relief
with Tums on the morning of the 20 of September , and came into the Glas Hospital Care Emergency Room. At NUOMC , an EKG showed flat to
inverted T waves laterally. In the Roniga Hospital Of Emergency
Room , he was given aspirin and oxygen with immediate improvement in
his pain from a 4/10 to 2/10 , and was made pain free after one
sublingual nitroglycerin. Again , he was observed for some time in
the emergency room until his first troponin came back positive at
28 , at which time he was admitted with a diagnosis of myocardial
infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
complicated by peripheral neuropathy and
impotence. He also has a history of burns in July of &apos;96
requiring skins grafts. He also has a history of obesity. Again ,
he has no prior coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS: NPH insulin 60 units in the morning and 30 units
in the evening.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient&apos;s temperature is 99.4 , blood
pressure 160/86 , pulse 90. Room air
saturation is 93%. The patient is in no apparent distress. HEENT
exam is unremarkable. Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops noted. Neck showed no jugular
venous distension. Carotids are 2+ without bruits. Pulmonary exam
is clear to auscultation. Abdomen showed normal active bowel
sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities showed no
cyanosis , clubbing or edema noted. Neurologic exam was nonfocal.
On rectal exam , he was guaiac negative.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: CBC showed a white count of 11 , hematocrit
was 44.4 , and platelet count was 219.
Patient&apos;s troponin I on admission is 27.7. Peak CK during
admission was 977 with MB fraction of 28.5. Cholesterol was 170
with triglycerides being 134. Sodium was 139 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 100 , bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 283. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 88 with , again , flat T waves to
interverted T waves in the lateral leads V4-V6. Chest x-ray showed
no active disease , no evidence of infiltrates or cardiomegaly or
effusions.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient smoked 1/2 pack per day of cigarettes
and quit in 1991. He occasionally drinks alcohol.
He lives with his family and he works in telecommunications. His
LDL was 123 in October of 1991.
FAMILY HISTORY: His uncle has coronary artery disease. No other
family members have coronary disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on September , 1997 with a
diagnosis of acute non-Q wave MI. He was started
on IV heparin which was continued for 48 hours and then
discontinued. He was also started on aspirin , beta blocker.
Initially , Lopressor 25 mg q.i.d. which was converted to once a day
atenolol. The patient remained chest pain free throughout his
hospital course and developed no evidence of arrhythmia while on
the cardiac monitor. Since the patient had slightly high blood
pressures with systolics in the 160-170 range , he was started on
lisinopril 10 mg q.day for his hypertension in a diabetic patient.
He also had nitropaste during his hospital stay. He was up in the
chair on day 3 , started ambulating on day 4. He underwent a submax
ETT prior to discharge , went 9 minutes without any chest pain or
EKG changes and was discharged to home on September , 1997. His
diabetes remained under good control while in the hospital. Also
during the hospital stay , the patient had an echocardiogram which
showed the following results: Ejection fraction was 53% with a low
normal systolic function and some posterior basal akinesis with
inferior hypokinesis and lateral hypokinesis. The plan for the
patient will be to follow up with Dr. Theo Sear and to undergo
and full ETT six weeks after his MI. Dr. Sopha will also check
the patient&apos;s lipid profile and start him on anticholesterol
medications as indicated.

ATTENDING: MOHOROVICH , BARRY MD
DATE OF ADMISSION: 4/5/06
DATE OF DISCHARGE: 2/29/06
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This patient is a 72-year-old female with a left plantar fifth
metatarsal ulcer since 3/14 The patient previously had an
ulcer in the same area , which healed successfully. The patient
had recurrence of her neuropathic ulcer and it has worsened and
deepened with progression to osteomyelitis involving the
metatarsal phalangeal joint. The patient&apos;s wound healing has
been confounded by longstanding lower extremity edema and as
well as congestive heart failure and venous stasis. The
ulcer has been previously treated with debridement , however , in
5/23 , it became infected and the patient developed left lower
extremity cellulitis , which progressed to the knee. The patient
was treated with antibiotics and subsequently developed profuse
diarrhea and was found to have a Clostridium difficile infection.
The patient was treated with oral Flagyl and vancomycin. She
presents on admission with continued loose stool. The patient
had previously undergone a three-phase bone scan , which was
positive for osteomyelitis and then confirmed by a gallium scan.
The patient has had decreased sensation from bilateral mid tibia
extending distally and denies pain. The patient is admitted from
a rehabilitation facility where she undergoes physical therapy.
At baseline , the patient has poor ambulation and is wheelchair
bound. The patient&apos;s cardiovascular risk factors include her
diabetes , venous stasis , coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
elevated cholesterol , and neuropathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lower extremity edema and venous stasis.
2. Right knee gout.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy , requiring AICD.
4. Status post removal of thyroid tumor.
5. Status post triple bypass coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.
6. Status post multiple myocardial infarctions.
7. Status post placement of coronary stents.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. at night , gabapentin 300 mg p.o. at
bedtime , allopurinol 150 mg p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , fentanyl patch 50 mcg an
hour q.72 h. , potassium chloride 80 mEq daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , vancomycin 250 mg orally three times
a day , Flagyl 500 mg three times a day , NPH insulin 25 units in
the morning , and oxycodone 5 mg q.4 h. p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa causes angioedema.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 5/5/2006 , the patient underwent debridement of her left foot
and amputation of the left fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint. On
10/19/2006 , the patient underwent closure of her wound.
OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES:
CT angiogram:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with multiple focal areas of
mild-to-moderate stenosis seen in the origin of the SMA ,
bilateral renal arteries , common and superficial femoral arteries
and popliteal arteries.
2. Occlusion of the mid third of the posterior tibial artery
with distal reformation on the right side.
3. Three-vessel run off in the left leg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on
5/5/2006 after undergoing her amputation. No concerning
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative
note for details. She was transferred to the floor from the PACU
in stable condition. The patient had adequate pain control and
was tolerating a regular diet by postoperative day #0. She was
placed on a fluid restriction in light of her congestive heart
failure. The patient&apos;s wound was clean with no evidence of
hematoma collection. She underwent wet-to-dry dressing changes
t.i.d. The patient underwent a CT angiogram to evaluate her
lower extremity vasculature; please see the results noted above
in the procedure section. In summary , the patient&apos;s three-vessel
run off to the left lower extremity indicated that she would not
likely need a bypass for wound healing at this time. In
addition , because the patient&apos;s wound was clean , Dr. Fregeau deemed
that it is appropriate to proceed the closure of the wound. As a
result , on 10/19/2006 , the patient returned to the operating room
and underwent closure of her wound; please see Dr. Visage &apos;s
dictated operative note for details of this procedure. Following
both of the patient&apos;s procedures , her pain was well controlled
with oral pain medications. The patient&apos;s cardiovascular status
remained stable postoperatively. She did continue on her
home/rehabilitation facility medication regimen for her
cardiovascular issues. The patient remained stable from a
respiratory standpoint. The patient did continue to have loose
bowel movements during her hospital stay. She continued on her
admission regimen for Clostridium difficile , which consisted of
oral Flagyl and oral vancomycin. There were multiple attempts to
save a stool specimen; either the patient did not save the stool
at times or it was mixed with copious amounts of urine. As a
result , a Clostridium difficile test is pending at the time of
discharge and will need to be followed up for test of cure while
at rehabilitation. The patient&apos;s hemodynamic status was
monitored closely as well as her fluid status. The patient was
placed on a 1500 mL fluid restriction due to her CHF. The
patient did have a slight rise in her creatinine from 1.4 to 1.8 ,
at the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s creatinine was trending
back down to 1.4. The patient&apos;s electrolytes were monitored and
repeated as necessary during her hospital stay. The patient
received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while as an
inpatient. The patient&apos;s cultures from the operating room were
positive for MRSA , and as a result , she continued on IV
vancomycin. The patient is to continue her IV vancomycin regimen
through follow up with Dr. Gittins in clinic. The patient was seen
by the Diabetes Management Service for evaluation of her diabetes
as her blood sugars were elevated on her admission regimen. As a
result , the Diabetes Management Service recommended a regimen
consisting of 25 units of NPH in the morning , 8 units of NPH at
bedtime , a standing NovoLog regimen of 4 units with meals in
addition a NovoLog sliding scale with meals and at bedtime. The
remainder of the patient&apos;s hospital course was relatively
unremarkable and she is to be discharged in stable condition back
to rehabilitation with adequate pain control. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow up in clinic with Dr. Kegerries in one to two weeks.

ventricle was moderately dilated. Overall LV function was low normal ,
the estimated EF of 50-55. The ventricle was
mildly hypokinetic with regional variation and right ventricle
size is mildly enlarged , global right ventricular systolic
function is moderately reduced. The left atrium is moderately
dilated and right atrium is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
is trileaflet calcified and mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation
as noted. Mitral valve is thickened and mildly retracted with
malcoaptation , moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation in some
views. The valve does not appear to coapt. Tricuspid valve is

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/10/05 and
underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 25% proximal
LAD , 30% mid RCA , right dominant circulation. The ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 64%. Hemodynamics PA mean of 22 ,
pulmonary capillary wedge of 7 , cardiac output of 4.0 , cardiac
index of 2.1 and an SVR of 1239 and PVR of 319 with moderate
aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral insufficiency. The
patient was taken to the operating room on 11/18/05 , and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a mitral valve repair with a
23 CarboMedics AnnuloFlex ring and a tricuspid valve repair. The
patient also had bilateral maze procedure with also resection of
the left atrial appendage , as well as his right atrial appendage.
The patient had two A-wires and ventricular wire placed and was
initially paced after the maze procedure. The patient came off
the heart lung machine on epinephrine , levo , and
milrinone and was taken up to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and
extubated on late postop day #1. The patient&apos;s hospital course
by systems ,
Neurological: The patient remained intact with no focal
deficits , however , the patient experienced dysphasia due to his
tonsil cancer status post XRT , failing speech and swallow and
finally requiring a PEG placement for nutritional support.
Cardiovascular: The patient was status post a maze procedure and
initially was paced and found to be in a junctional rhythm at 60
then recovery of normal sinus rhythm , however , postoperatively
had gone into a rate controlled atrial fibrillation requiring
low-dose beta-blocker as well as anticoagulation. However , he
did see few episodes of sinus rhythm and currently on discharges
in sinus rhythm and rate controlled on low-dose beta-blocker.
The patient did have an echo postoperatively to evaluate his
valve replacement and repair and found to have normal LV size and
function with an EF of 55%. The patient had mild RV enlargement ,
mild left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement.
The aortic valve was noted to be well seated with trace AI ,
mitral valve status post repair showed mild mitral regurgitation ,
tricuspid valve status post repair showed mild tricuspid repair
with PA pressures of 40 mmHg. There was no pericardial effusion
found and patient will be discharged on low-dose beta-blocker as
well as anticoagulation.
Respiratory: Patient was extubated on late postoperative day #1
and patient was on Lasix for diuresis postoperatively. The
patient , however , on postoperative day #10 , was noted to have a
temperature and culture showed that he had enterobacter in his
sputum and is being treated with ceftriaxone for a 14-day course.
His discharge chest x-ray shows no evidence consolidation and
mild atelectasis at the left base , no pulmonary edema noted.
GI: The patient had a history of GERD and was on Zantac
preoperatively and was on proton pump postoperatively and
switched over to Pepcid for GI prophylaxis. The patient also was
closely followed by the speech and swallow team and due to his
dysphagia status post squamous cell carcinoma resection of his
left tongue and XRT , patient continues to have dysphasia , unable
to protect his airway and by postoperative day #14 underwent a
PEG placement and now at goal of 70 mL per hour to see if he is
tolerating without any problems. The patient however was on
diuresis for a period of time and required few doses of fluid
bolus for his volume status.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
his postoperative course , was on Lasix for diuresis postop
without no elevation in his creatinine.
Endocrine: The patient was on portland protocol intraoperatively
and switched over to sliding scale insulin postoperatively due to his
tube feeds. He is on regular insulin standing now at 6 units
with sliding scale for coverage.
Heme: The patient was noted to have a drop in his platelets
postoperatively. Two hit screens were sent which were found to
be negative and patient had recovery of his platelets with
discharge platelets of 196. The patient will be discharged on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Today&apos;s INR is 2.1 and he will
be getting his preop dose of 2.5 mg tonight and to follow closely
with his INR. He is also on baby aspirin for his coronary artery
disease and patient was not on Plavix for his stent
preoperatively and will not be on discharge.
ID: The patient received vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis.
On postoperative day #10 , the patient was noted to have a
temperature of 101 and was cultured. Sputum grew out
enterobacter and patient was started on ceftriaxone and will
complete a 14-day course of ceftriaxone. The patient during that
time received neb treatments , chest physical therapy and is still
continuing to bring up some secretion. The patient was noted
also to have a heel blister on his left heel which was debrided
and now is very clean and dry ulcer that was evaluated by the
skin nurse and felt that Xeroform would be the best treatment at
this time and the legs should be elevated on pillows to relieve
any pressure off of the heel for continual healing and
prevention or breakdown. The patient is in stable condition and
has been accepted to a rehab bed on postoperative day #20 and
will be discharged to the rehab facility in stable condition on
these following medications.

a previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. Her
most recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an FEV1 of 38%
and an FVC of 51% , with an FEV1/FVC of less than 80%. This was
felt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.
She has been treated with Theophylline and Proventil as well as
home nebulizers , Lasix , and 02 overnight. She continues to smoke
as well as noted above. She has had frequent episodes of cough and
productive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. She now
presents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip ,
denying any change in her cough or sputum production although she
did note a slightly increased temperature. She began to become
more short of breath and was taken to the Emergency Ward by her
sister. There , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturation
of 59%. Her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pCO2 79 , p02 78%
saturation after one nebulizer treatment. Her peak flows after
three nebulizers were only 90. She began to become somnolent with
a repeat blood gas showing a pCO2 of 94 , and was therefore
intubated and transferred to the MICU. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Was
remarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 )
borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis ,
( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis ,
( 9 ) obesity. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy
in 1979 , status post back surgery. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , KCL , Lodine 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA WHICH CAUSES HER TO HAVE A
RASH. HABITS: She continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40
pack years. There is no alcohol use. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives
alone. She has two sons. She is assisted by her sister.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obese
female in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. HEENT
was unremarkable. Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an I:E ratio of 1:4. Heart:
Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. Breasts: No masses. Abdomen: Obese , mild tenderness to
deep palpation , normal bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema to her
calves bilaterally , no clubbing. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses. On neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic and
difficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. Her
reflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride
98 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 113. Her liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. Her hematocrit was
47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. The PT was 11.4 , and the PTT was
30.5. Theophylline level was 5.3. ABG&apos;s were as mentioned above.
Post intubation , ABG 7.45 , pCO2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation.
The most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function.
The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with no
infiltrates. The urinalysis revealed too numerous to count white
blood cells and 4+ bacteria. Cultures eventually grew out E. coli.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundle
branch block , inverted T&apos;s in V1 and V2 , but no significant change
compared with 11/1
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and continued on the
ventilator until 3/6/93. She was given aggressive
bronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , Albuterol and Atropent.
She was started on IV Solu-Medrol dose which was rapidly tapered on
a p.o. schedule. She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone to
cover a possible tracheobronchitis. She was also continued on her
Ancef as well. Her urinary tract infection was treated via the
Ceftriaxone. She did well over the next two days and essentially
was ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. She was
watched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferred
to the floor on 6/14/93. By this time , her 02 saturations were 92%
on two liters. She was afebrile , and her peak flows were improving
with continued Albuterol nebulizers and Atrovent inhaler. Her
polymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. There
was a question whether or not her urinary tract infection was
adequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000
colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. These
were clean catches. She had it repeated one more time as a clean
catch , and this was found to grow probable Pseudomonas species ,
with an exact speciation pending. This last culture on 5/17/93 was
associated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. Because
of this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that it
was necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cath
specimen was obtained. The patient was informed that if her
dysuria were to persist that she was to call Dr. Gigger immediately ,
but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. She
also received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that her
oxygen saturations dropped to 46% during REM sleep. This was at a
point when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had an
element of essential sleep apnea. She also during periods of
non-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstruction
and not breathing at all. This revealed that she also has a
component of obstructive sleep apnea as well. She was started on
Progesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed for
evaluation for possible nasal C-PAP. The patient was discharged on
8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes than
previously. There were no complications.

ATTENDING: JOHNNIE REED MD
SERVICE: GMS Vo Rochena Fortwardport
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Osteomyelitis of the left foot.
2. Cellulitis of the right and left foot.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.
2. Asthma.
3. Peripheral vascular disease status post fem pop in 2001 on
left , 1999 fem pop on right ( no known CAD last echocardiogram
7/10 with an ejection fraction of 73% ).
4. Diabetes mellitus ( last hemoglobin A1c prior to admission was
7.7 in 9/18 ).
5. Hypertension.
6. Peripheral neuropathy.
7. Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3 to
1.4.
8. Multiple infections status post incision and drainage and
amputation of the 5th left metatarsal in 10/15 for
osteomyelitis ( tendency toward sepsis treated in the past with
levofloxacin and clindamycin given allergies with success , also
history of multiple cellulitis related to surgical incisions
bilaterally in the thighs ).
9. History of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
10. Status post API.
11. Status post cholecystectomy.
12. Status post discectomy and laminectomy. Her podiatrist of
record is Dr. Kocieda His telephone number is 092-829-8896.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 66-year-old female with
severe diabetes mellitus type II , autoimmune hemolytic anemia ,
peripheral vascular disease , COPD , asthma , and history of
multiple infections who presents with bilateral lower extremity
area edema , swelling , and pain. She specifically complained of
increasing erythema , swelling , and pain of the right second toe
and left foot x 1 day. She saw her podiatrist on the morning of
admission , 7/6/2003 , and her right toe was drained at that
time , yielding pus. Cultures were drawn and it was noted that
she was have increasing erythema over the right ankle and the
left foot all the way to the shin. She had no fever but did have
chills , no shortness of breath or cough , wheezing , no dizziness
or orthostatic symptoms. She had recently been admitted between
8/7/2003 and 3/2/2003 for a COPD flare , pneumonia , and
anemia. She is known to hemolyze additionally in the setting of
infection. At that time she was treated on steroids and at the
time of this admission , was on a prednisone taper. During that
prior admission , she had also being treated with levofloxacin ,
was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells , and was also
being treated with Aramis. She had had an abdominal CT during
that admission for left upper quadrant pain , which demonstrated
no evidence of splenic infarct. In the ED on this admission , she
was afebrile , her vital signs were stable , she was started on
levofloxacin , and she had plain films of her right foot , which
were consistent with evidence of chronic versus acute
osteomyelitis of the second toe.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems , she denied any chest
pain , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and her
fingerstick , she mentioned , had been running high , to the 250s on
prednisone. She has a left plantar ulcer as well , which she had
planned on having surgery soon for.
ALLERGIES: To Keflex , Ultram , Vancomycin , and Linezolid. With
Linezolid , she gets headaches and hypertension , with Vancomycin
hives , Ultram produces systemic reaction of unclear nature , and
to Keflex her allergy is questionable because she has tolerated
cephalosporins and penicillins in the past by report of the
admitting team.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for colon cancer and esophageal cancer
in her father and mother respectively.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a former nurse at Forestnew Medical Center She is married and has one daughter. She has a
35-pack year history of smoking but she quit in 1994. No alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for an elevated blood pressure of
150/70 , stable heart rate of 70 , afebrile , saturating 100% on
room air , breathing at 18. Other notable aspects of her physical
examination: Chest: She had a left carotid bruit. Her chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally with the exception of mild
diffuse inspiratory wheezes. Cardiac: She had a regular rate ,
distant heart sounds on her cardiac examination but no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Benign. Back: No CVA tenderness in
her extremities. Extremities: She had tense edema , left greater
than right. She also had an ulcer on the plantar surface of the
left extremity , which was not fluctuant but did have
serosanguinous drainage and erythema that was circumferential to
the mid-shin. There was more tenderness over the lateral
malleolus. She also had some left calf tenderness with a
questionable palpable cord. In her right lower extremity , she
had erythema over the right second toe with a punctate lesion
draining serosanguinous fluid. Discontinuous erythema over the
interior shin was also noted. She had diffuse onychomycosis and
right intradigital ulceration between the 4th and 5th toe. There
was not right calf tenderness that was noted. Neurological:
Neurological was grossly intact and there were no focal deficits
noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious Disease: Her blood cultures were positive for
gram-positive cocci , which was resistant to methicillin ,
clindamycin , and levofloxacin. She had an MRI of the lower
extremities bilaterally , which demonstrated no collections but
was notable for acute osteomyelitis of the left 2nd and 3rd
metatarsal as well as chronic osteitis of the calcaneous wounds.
The right phalanges were not visualized well. She was started on
Levaquin initially but this was discontinued when the
sensitivities came back and instead she was started on
dopthromycin. Infectious Disease was consulted at this time and
the antibiotics were changed to Bactrim IV and then to p.o.
Bactrim secondary to an increase in her creatinine. A TTE on
2/21/2003 was negative for any vegetation. She underwent
debridement on 10/19/2003 in the afternoon. The material was
sent for culture. She also complained of sternal discomfort ,
dysphasia , and oral thrush on examination , and it was felt that
she likely had oral candidiasis secondary to her steroid course
and so she was started on Diflucan as well as on a nystatin swish
and swallow. The cultures from her bone tissue were positive
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as
beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Infectious Disease once again felt
that , given her allergies , that p.o. Bactrim would be the best
way to treat these pathogens. On 3/19/2003 , the Diflucan was
discontinued and she was continued on nystatin swish and swallow
for the oral candidiasis , which has since been improving. She is
also being continued on Bactrim and her creatinine has stabilized
at 1.9 after peaking at 2.2. She has follow ups scheduled with
the Infectious Disease physicians on 1/27/2004 and will be
continuing her Bactrim for a full 6-week course with weekly CBC
checks , which will be monitored by her primary care physician ,
Dr. Sherman Handel
2. Heme: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic
anemia. Her hematologist of record is Dr. Bocanegra On her
last admission , she required transfusions and was thought to have
hemolyzed in the setting of her pneumonia although her hemolysis
labs at that time were negative. On this admission , her LDH and
bilirubins were normal , her hematocrit steadily decreased from
38.8 to 27 and then increased. She had an increase in her LDH
but no schistocytes were notable on smear. Nevertheless , she was
thought to be hemolyzing and received a total of 6 units of
packed red blood cells , given in doses of 2 units each over the
course of this hospitalization. She was transfused successfully
without any complications or transfusion reactions and her
hematocrit at the time of discharge is 36.0.
3. Pulmonary: The patient&apos;s prednisone taper was discontinued
on day 4 because of oral candidiasis. She was continued on nebs ,
however , for intermittent wheezing. She has had no acute COPD
exacerbations but has had increased shortness of breath
periodically , which has been improved with nebulizer treatments.
Chest x-ray on 1/7/2003 demonstrated a small bilateral
effusion. She was thought to be fluid overloaded at this time so
her Lasix was restarted for diuresis. Also of note , the patient
had pain in the left posterior lower lung field , which was
pleuritic in nature. She had LENIs done , which were negative ,
had a PE protocol CT on 1/7/2003 , which was negative. At that
time , she was diuresed and her pleuritic left lower lobe chest
pain resolved with diuresis. She had a recurrence of this pain 2
days prior to discharge after receiving 2 units of packed red
blood cells , which presumably led to a volume overload situation.
However , once again , after diuresis , she had complete resolution
of her symptoms. At this time , the CT scan was reviewed to
ensure that there was no fracture of the ribs as she did have
tenderness in the left lower lung field area. However , the ribs
were visualized well and there was no evidence of any fracture.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol and her
Diovan was held secondary to elevated potassium. She had
intermittent chest pain without EKG changes , possibly secondary
to esophageal spasm , which was relieved by nitroglycerine. Her
enzymes were negative for the first episode. Her troponin was
0.25 on random draw. This was likely a false positive and her
enzymes thereafter were negative. She had a preoperative MIBI on
10/11/2003 , which demonstrated a moderate area of reversible
ischemia in the territory of the right coronary artery. The
decision was made , however , to go ahead with the surgery for her
feet with spinal block , not with general anesthesia. Her Toprol
was increased to 75 mg q.d. given her MIBI findings. Her goal
heart rate was set for the 60s and a low-dose statin was also
added to her regimen. It was felt that the cardiovascular plan
in terms of her coronary artery disease should be to increase her
exercise tolerance during rehab to the point where she may begin
to experience symptoms and then cap at that time can be
considered. Towards the end of the patient&apos;s hospitalization ,
she required diuresis , particularly after receiving boluses of
volume with her blood transfusions. It was noted that , when her
volume status went up , she had an increase in swelling of her
lower extremities bilaterally as well as recurrences of her
left-sided back pain in the area of the left lower lung field.
However , as noted before , these improved with diuresis.
5. Renal: Her baseline creatinine is 1.3 to 1.4 , increased on
this admission likely due secondary to the dye load , which she
received prior to scans. Her creatinine peaked at 2.7 with the
IV Bactrim but began to trend down after the IV Bactrim was
discontinued. Other reasons for which her creatinine likely
increased during this admission were secondary to her
dopthromycin and also secondary to the IV Bactrim.
6. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s blood sugars have been well
controlled after her prednisone was discontinued and she was
maintained on a regimen of NPH.
7. Ophthalmology: The Ophthalmology team was consulted for a
new left floater. The patient has a history of vitreous
hemorrhages and questionable retinal detachment in the past. The
optic examination was notable for vitreous bleed. In response to
this , the head of the patient&apos;s bed was elevated and her symptoms
were stable thereafter. If she has a recurrence of curtains
symptoms or spots or flashes , it is recommended that
Ophthalmology be reconsulted at that time.
8. GI: The patient had complained of right upper quadrant pain
during this admission. Her liver function tests were elevated
when initially checked. It was recommended by Infectious Disease
since these would be monitored with IV Bactrim. They have been
trending down since she is status post cholecystectomy and was
initially very tender in her right upper quadrant. Her right
upper quadrant ultrasound on 10/19/2003 was negative except for
an enlarged liver alkaline phosphatase that was thought to be
secondary to osteomyelitis. Her right upper quadrant pain
improved subsequently during this hospital course with continued
diuresis and antibiotic treatment.

time in stable condition to the rehab facility. She is being
discharged on the following medications.

Discharge Date: 9/1/2005
ATTENDING: HAGAMAN , JUAN MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. Pregnancy at 34 weeks with Di/Di twins , IUFD of one twin.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. High blood pressure , chronic hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kerry Winninger is a 32-year-old
G1 , P0 who presented to obstetrical triage at 34 weeks&apos; gestation
with mono/Di twins with complaints of decreased fetal movement as
well as cough in the setting of nausea and vomiting. In triage ,
the fetal heart tracing on twin #2 was unable to be obtained , so
an ultrasound was quickly brought and showed that twin #1 had FH
100 to 108 with no evidence of FH in twin #2. Given evidence of
an IUFD and possible fetal distress in twin #2 , she was brought
for a stat cesarean section which was ultimately complicated by
multiple factors.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic hypertension.
2. Hypothyroidism.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Obesity.
5. Diabetes type II.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: An appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION:
1. Levoxyl 88 mcg p.o. daily.
2. NPH as well as insulin managed via sliding scale as well as
NPH given at night and in the morning.
3. Albuterol p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Latex leading to a rash. Pineapple leading to GI
distress.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Denied any alcohol , tobacco , or drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Diabetes in father and grandmother.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Brain Govea was immediately brought to
the operating room and underwent an uncomplicated stat cesarean
section within 15 minutes of her arrival to obstetrical triage.
For complete details of the surgery that she underwent , please
see the dictation from that day. The preoperative diagnoses were
bradycardia , twin #1 , in triage; absent fetal cardiac activity in
#2; and 34 weeks gestational age with mo/Di twins. Postoperative
diagnoses were listed as chorioamnionitis , diabetes , and demise
of twin #2. The findings were consistent with a live born male
infant Apgars 5 and 8; a stillborn male infant , Apgars 0 and 0;
and intact placenta and a foul-smelling amniotic fluid with light
meconium in twin #1. There were no complications.
Her postpartum course was highly complicated by several issues
that will be dealt with by system. In short , she suffered a Vfib
arrest in the setting of the DIC , potential sepsis , potential
HELLP syndrome , and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and intubated. Ultimately , she was discharged from the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and was monitored on the labor floor
and then was transferred to postpartum where she continued to
recover and regain function until postoperative day #12 when she
was discharged home with VNA in stable condition. Her issues
will be dealt with by system.
1. Cardiology. Within 3 hours following her for stat cesarean
section , she presented with acute onset of shortness of breath ,
chest discomfort in the setting of a postpartum hemorrhage.
Telemetry was applied and had evidence of widening QRS complexes ,
and ultimately , she went into Vfib arrest with pulseless
electrical activity. She underwent aggressive resuscitation in
the form of 2 shocks with epinephrine following the code blue.
She was brought back to the operating room where Chem-7 revealed
potassium of 7 which may have been the etiology of this Vfib
arrest. A pulse was obtained following the 2 shocks and
epinephrine , and she was intubated to clear her airway. She was
then transferred to the medical intensive care unit where cardiac
enzymes were followed for 4 total sets and were found to be
grossly positive. The impression of her positive cardiac enzymes
that did trend downwords was that it was secondary to the
aggressive chest compressions and were felt not likely to lead to
significant myocardial injury. An echocardiogram that was
obtained on postoperative day #2 while she was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed no evidence of focal wall
motion abnormalities and showed that the overall left ventricular
function was normal with an EF of 55%. Of note , throughout her
MICU admission , she was tachycardic to 120s to 140s , and this
was ascribed to her marked amounts of postpartum hemorrhage in
the setting of possible chorioamnionitis with sepsis. This
tachycardia resolved by postoperative day #6 , and by
postoperative day #12 , she was no longer tachycardia with a heart
rate in the 80&apos;s.
Her blood pressure while in the initial postpartum period was
maintained in the normal range , began to become elevated by
postoperative day #8 , and she was started on postoperative day
#10 on her labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This controlled her
hypertension throughout the remainder of her hospital course , and
she was discharged home on labetalol.
2. Hematology. Following her stat cesarean section , she
underwent a postpartum hemorrhage with an estimated hemorrhage of
5-6 L of blood from her vagina. This dissection itself had only
700 cc blood loss. At this time , her fibrinogen was appreciated
to be 78 and her coags were markedly elevated. In the setting of
DIC , she underwent an aggressive product resuscitation and
ultimately she received 20 units of packed red blood cells , 7
units of fresh frozen plasma , 3 pools of platelets , 1200 mcg of
activated factor 7A , 2 units of cryoprecipitate , 4 units of 5%
albumin , and 1 bag of Hespan within a timeframe of 3 to 6 hours.
With this aggressive resuscitation , her hematocrit dropped to as
low as 26.4 , but we within 2 hours , had increased to 61.3.
Acutely following this episode after her aggressive
resuscitation , her fibrinogen increased from its low of 87 to
337. Her DIC continued to be low-grade , even after being
discharged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit. For this
reason , she was monitored on the labor floor for an additional
day postoperative day #4 , and her coagulation studies ranged from
an INR of 1.2 to 1.4. When she was admitted to postpartum , her
INR was 1.1 , and the day before discharge from the hospital , her
coagulation studies were found to be normal with an INR of 1.1
and fibrinogen of 377.
Her platelets became an area of concern when she presented with a
platelet level that was found to be fluctuating between 90 and
185. In the initial presentation after her postpartum
hemorrhage. Her platelets while in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit went to as low as 57 , and this was felt to be possibly a
component of her HELLP syndrome versus dilution from her blood
product resuscitation also part of her DIC consumptive
coagulopathy. Although her DIC consumptive coagulopathy had
evidence that it had resolved , her platelets remained low and
reached another low postoperative #7 when they became 69. A
hematology consult was obtained to evaluate the possible causes
of her low platelets , and she underwent an extensive evaluation
including a negative anticardiolipin and a negative lupus
anticoagulant. The impression was one of low platelets secondary
to shock liver in addition to DIC in addition to dilution with
marked amounts of blood products , especially in the setting of
the hematocrit ranging from the 49 to 50 range at that time. Her
platelets continued to improve throughout the hospital course and
her platelets upon discharge were 144 and had trended up from the
low of 69.
Her hematocrit initially was found to be very high , upon
presentation at 51. This was consistent with hemoconcentration
with a trough to as low as 26 while in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit. Following her resuscitation , it went to as high as 61. On
postoperative day #7 , however , it dropped from 46 to 40 and then
dropped again to 37.5 upon repeat check. This was of concern but
2 subsequent hematocrits were stable in the 39 range. Her final
hematocrit on the day of discharge was 39.5. This dropping
hematocrit was discovered in the setting of a rectus muscle
hematoma that will be dealt with elsewhere in the dictation but
her hematocrit was stable upon discharge.
3. GI. Upon presentation , Ms. Neeb had evidence of increasing
LFTs. While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit , she was found to
have an AST of 177 , ALT of 124 , and total bilirubin of 6.2.
These elevated liver enzymes in the setting of her low platelets
was suspicious for possible HELLP syndrome. These LFTs continued
to improve with the AST and ALT dropping down to the normal
limits. Upon discharge , she was appreciated to have an ALT of 37
and AST of 48. Her bilirubin , however , continued to increase
from 6.2 to as high as 11.2. In the setting of her increasing
bilirubin while the other LFTs continued to improve , a GI consul
was obtained , and she underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound
two times , once while on the labor floor and once while on the
postpartum floor. Both of these revealed a normal liver , normal
biliary tree , as well as normal-sized spleen. In the setting of
a normal nonobstructive picture , the GI consult had the
impression that the increased bilirubin was secondary to her
shock liver as well as the multiple blood transfusions and
possible sepsis. They were confident that this would continued
to improve but would likely take 2 to 3 weeks. Upon discharge ,
her total bilirubin had begun to decrease to 8.2. She did
manifest evidence of jaundice that was improving through the
hospital course.
On postoperative day #9 , Ms. Culp developed a marked increase in
her amylase and lipase. This was checked in the setting of
increasing right upper quadrant pain that ultimately resolved.
Her lipase was elevated to as high as 438 to 474. GI was again
reconsulted and had the impression that she did not suffer from
pancreatitis given that she had no nausea or vomiting , was
tolerating a regular diet , and had resolved abdominal pain. They
felt that this was likely secondary to post-surgical change and
was not an aggressive process that may need further treatment.
An abdominal pelvic CT also demonstrated a normal pancreas
without any evidence of stranding or pseudocyst formation.
The overall impression of the Obstetrics team was that her
constellation of acute-onset DIC associated with
hyperbilirubinemia and low platelets was all consistent with a
potential diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. This
diagnosis is one that can be best made by a liver biopsy and
discussions with the GI Service revealed that they did not feel
strongly that she needed a liver biopsy. The GI Service was
skeptical with regard to the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of
pregnancy despite the clinical hallmarks being manifest in this
patient. They felt as if her symptoms could be adequately
explained by the degree of shock liver and postpartum hemorrhage
that she experienced. It was unclear as to whether or not she
had acute fatty liver of pregnancy , but given the risk of
recurrence , she will be counseled as an outpatient with regard to
future pregnancies and management of these pregnancies , given her
history of potential acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
4. Incision. On postoperative day #10 , she developed a dark
blood ooze from a 2-mm portion on the right aspect of her
Pfannenstiel incision. This was concerning for a possible
subcutaneous hematoma. So an abdominopelvic CT was obtained on
postoperative day #10 that showed evidence of an 8 x 5 cm right
rectus hematoma that may have had an area of tracking through the
fascia into the subcutaneous space. It was felt that this could
undergo dressing daily , and would ultimately seal up and stop
bleeding. She was discharged home with VNA daily dressing
changes and plan to reassess the incision at her followup
postpartum appointment in 4 days from the date of discharge. Of
note , this right rectus hematoma was diagnosed in the setting of
a drop in her hematocrit from 46 to 40. Her hematocrit remained
stable for 2 additional days at 39.5.
5. Infectious disease. On postoperative day #0 , following her
stat cesarean section. She had a T-Max of 101.9 in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit , and ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin
as well as levoflox ofloxacin were started on IV and was
continued for 6 days until ultimately her blood cultures grew out
no organism. The urine cultures were negative and her placenta
culture also demonstrated only staphylococcus coagulase negative
with a Gram&apos;s stain showing no organisms. She remained afebrile
for the remainder of her hospital course and was not discharged
on antibiotics.
6. Endocrine. Initially following her Medical Intensive Care
Unit admission , her blood sugar remained low throughout the day
despite her eating habits. Her blood sugars would get as slow as
the 40s and as high as the 80s. This was perplexing as she was
known to be type 2 diabetic who initially been managed on
metformin prepregnancy. An endocrine consult was obtained. The
concern was for possible addisonian crisis and cord stimulation
test was normal as well as a.m. and p.m. cortisol levels were
checked. These remained within normal limits , and the concern
for possible Sheehan syndrome secondary to her massive postpartum
hemorrhage was largely excluded. A TSH as well as an ACTH level
where both drawn , and her TSH was 1.05 in the normal range and
the ACTH test was 51 , within the normal range. Of note , her
blood sugars did trend up near the end of her hospital course.
On postoperative day #10 , she was found to have fasting sugars in
the 120s. She was restarted on NPH 10 units daily. q.p.m. and
q.a.m. as well as her Humalog sliding scale a.c. She was
discharged home with prescriptions for NPH as well as her Humalog
and will follow her sugars. These will be followed up by her
endocrinologist Dr. Kuk within 4 days of this discharge.
7. Renal. While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit , she
suffered acute renal failure with a creatinine that went as high
as 2.1. This improved to 1.0 upon discharge. Of note , she had a
decreased sodium appreciated on postoperative day #7. Urinary
electrolytes were drawn and fractional excretion of sodium was
appreciated to be 0.32 consistent with prerenal , and the urine
osmolality was 400 consistent with concentrated urine that may or
may not have been consistent with syndrome of inappropriate ADH.
She underwent fluid restriction for 3 days and her sodium
improved from 129 to 134 upon discharge.
8. Pulmonary. Immediately following her Vfib arrest , she was
complaining of severe rather shortness of breath and was
intubated on the first attempt. At this time , intubated and
sedated , she was in the MICU and was extubated on postoperative
day #2. She was transitioned to nasal cannula after being on
FiO2 of 80% and ultimately was discharged home sating 99 to 100%
on room air with a good exercise tolerance.
9. Infant. Their baby boy Towery was doing very well upon
discharge. He was followed by the pediatric service at Chardson Medical Center and was discharged home with them.
10. Neuro. Initially , her mental status in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit would wax and wane. She would be
intermittently disoriented. A head CT was obtained postoperative
day #4 , and this was shown to have no focal abnormalities
although there was some indication that there might have been
some stranding between the white and gray matter consistent with
possible edema. This report was not mentioned in the final
report of the head CT. Upon discharge , her mental status was at
baseline with perfect memory of the event leading up to the stat
cesarean section although she had some difficulty remembering
specifics with regards to her Medical Intensive Care Unit
admission , and the ensuing days. She was alert and oriented to
person , place , and time.
11. Physical therapy. She underwent a physical therapy consult
with the impression of improving physical status and exercise.
She was given exercise strategies that she will continue at home.
She was offered home physical therapy but declined as she
thought the visiting VNA would be adequate and that she was able
to be out of bed with her usual exercise tolerance.
DISPOSITION: On postoperative day #11 , status post her stat
cesarean sections for IUFD with twins and postpartum hemorrhage
DIC , she was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the OB
clinic in 4 days with Dr. Fred Riter and Dr. Shad Brondyke
She will also be seen by Dr. Durnin of endocrinology. She will
have daily VNA dressing changes and was instructed to call if she
had any fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , increased bleeding from
the incision or if she had any questions.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily.
3. Oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
4. Senna tablets 2 tabs p.o. b.i.d.
5. Simethicone 80 mg p.o. q.i.d.
6. Labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. NPH 10 units q.a.m. and q.p.m.
8. Humalog sliding scale AC 5-10 units.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Pregnancy , status post stat cesarean section for IUFD ,
nonreassuring fetal heart tracing.
2. Vfib arrest.
3. DIC.
4. Severe PET/HELLP.
5. Thrombocytopenia.
6. Elevated liver enzymes.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. A2 gestational diabetes.
Ultimately she was discharged home with low platelets.
Throughout her hospital course , she was appreciated to have
evidence of low platelets on her first CBC upon presentation to
Ardma Medical Center as well as chest compressions , and a
pulse was once again obtained. In the triage , she was found to
have evidence of a demised twin as well as evidence of a heart
rate of the second twin in the 90&apos;s.

Discharge Date: 5/3/1999
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64 year-old gentleman
with a history of chest discomfort ,
dyspnea on exertion and fatigue who was scheduled for a coronary
artery bypass grafting. He had cardiac catheterization at Ryhoagberg Spisus Community Hospital on August , 1999 which demonstrated a 30%
tapering lesion of the left main coronary artery , 70% proximal
lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery , 80% lesion
distal to D1 , 100% occlusion of his left circumflex and a 100%
occlusion of his right coronary artery. He is admitted on March , 1999 for coronary artery bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Psoriasis and polymyalgia rheumatica ,
coronary artery disease and wide eye
glaucoma. His echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular
hypertrophy with a normal ejection fraction. He has a 45 year
history of smoking.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Zocor 40
mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Nitropatch.
6 ) Enteric coated aspirin p.o. q. day. 7 ) Timolol eye drops to
his left eye. 8 ) Captopril 18.75 mg p.o. three times a day. 9 )
Tagamet 50 mg p.o. twice a day. 10 ) Calcium supplementation.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission revealed a BUN of 20 ,
creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell count 8.8 , hematocrit
40.2. Chest x-ray revealed no acute disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On May , 1999 , he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times three with a left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the aorta and a saphenous vein graft from
the obtuse marginal to the aorta. His intraoperative course was
uncomplicated. On postoperative day number one , he was weaned to
extubation and he was treated with stress steroids to prevent
steroid withdrawal. On postoperative day number one , he was taken
back to the operating room for bleeding. After he was extubated ,
he was reintubated and was returned in good and stable condition to
the intensive care unit on renal Dopamine. He was again extubated
and was seen in consultation by the Gastrointestinal Service for a
question of gastrointestinal bleed since there was a clot seen on
the transesophageal echocardiogram probe at its withdrawal from his
first surgery. The Gastrointestinal Service saw any evidence of
any upper gastrointestinal bleed and he was maintained on H2
blockers. He was sent to the step down unit on routine
postoperative day number two and his Captopril was increased for
afterload reduction. His course improved and he was diuresed for a
volume overload still requiring oxygen supplementation on two
liters. His oxygen saturation was only 91% on postoperative day
number three. He continued to improve and continued to have care
for his respiratory situation with continued diuresis and nebulizer
treatments and ambulation. He was screened by rehabilitation and
awaited rehabilitation placement. He did acquire a rehabilitation
bed on postoperative day number six and he is being transferred to
rehabilitation on the following medications.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Prednisone 5 mg p.o. twice a day.
2 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q. day. 3 ) Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day. 4 ) Niferex 150 mg

Discharge Date: 8/10/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 71 year old gentleman with a
history of severe coronary artery disease who
presented with unstable angina with probable mesenteric ischemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include a history
of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,
remote history of smoking , questionable positive family history ,
and no diabetes mellitus. The patient has had a history of
coronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. In the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarction
number 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non Q
wave MI , refused catheterization. ETT was done and he was treated
with Atenolol and Isordil. In 2/23/93 the patient had an anterior
myocardial infarction and subsequently had a V-tach , V-fib arrest ,
converted with 200 joules at Mid-ma Hospital and received TPA ,
heparin , Lidocaine , and his peak CPK value was 7975. Echo revealed
an ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , left
atrial enlargement. The course was complicated by post MI chest
pain. On 11/27/93 the patient was transferred to Rahfletchgreenesouth Rehabilitation Hospital Of Cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% LAD
lesion and 100% PDA lesion , 90% D1 lesion , and the patient had PTCA
of LAD to a remaining 40% lesion and D1 PTCA with 40% residual.
Post PTCA course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and
anterior ST elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a
70% LAD , 100% D1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated with
repeat PTCA of LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient was
given Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Since then ,
the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of health
without any chest pain for the two years until about three days
prior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,
epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for
4-6 hour episodes. Occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.
He denied orthopnea , PND , edema. The patient&apos;s pain was similar
to but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. The patient
denied chest pain. On 5/25/96 , the patient was seen by Dr. Mcgray
of PVH . The patient continued to have abdominal pain. Patient
had CHF on examination. An EKG revealed new lateral T wave
changes. The patient was sent to Tanjuan Tialan Vition Hospital and there the
patient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved with
nitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to Bert Stern Medical Center
In the Emergency Room , the patient had shortness of breath , blood
pressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to have
abdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. He
received Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary to
increased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequently
improved. Chest pain resolved. His EKG had T wave inversions in
V5 through V6.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for coronary artery disease
as above. Status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. PTCA of LAD. 2. Peptic ulcer disease. 3.
Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status post
amputation of right third distal phalanx. 6. History of
nephrolithiasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s. , Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.day , Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor

equipment operator. He smoked 15 pack years and
quit twenty years ago. Alcohol occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive coronary artery disease in two sisters
with myocardial infarctions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 72 , blood
pressure of 104/68 , respiratory rate of 16.
Oxygen saturation of 97%. HEENT examination revealed no JVD.
Cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border. Chest was
soft bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. A ventral hernia was present
which was easily reducible. Extremities showed no cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. Neuro examination was nonfocal. Rectal was
guaiac negative per the Emergency Ward.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. He had a
hematocrit of 43.6 and white blood count
of 9.8. LFTs were within normal range. PT of 20.2 , PTT of 38.2 ,
INR of 2.8. ABG on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% in
the Emergency Room. Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Room
revealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladder
stones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,
low volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. EKG upon arrival
in the Emergency Ward revealed sinus tachycardia , T wave flattening
in AVL , T wave inversion V4 through V6 which were new , poor R wave
progression which was old. Pain free EKG revealed resolution of T
wave inversion in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the rule out MI
protocol. He actually ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with a CPK of 168 , CPK2 of 138 , and CPK3 of 147.
However on 11/10/96 his T wave inversion in V1 and V2 were noted to
be deeper on C set compared to A set. Subsequently that day the
patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. As his IV heparin
and TNG were being turned down he became acutely short of breath
with bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. He was found
to be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , IV
TNG , and also Lasix. The patient did very well after that and his
troponin level at that point was 0. The patient&apos;s CPKs were
recycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.
His ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness of
breath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis he
was able to be on room air without any difficulty. It was
therefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on 10/4/96 which revealed
proximally occluded LAD , 60-70% lesion of OM1 , and 99% lesion of
proximal PDA , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with
extensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apical
akinesis. Based on this it was decided that the patient had three
vessel disease. In anticipation of surgical conservation the
patient had a ETT MIBI on 7/11/96 and he was able to go on modified
Bruce protocol 6 minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue. He did
not achieve target heart rate. His maximum heart rate was 104 and
85% of the predicted value. Subsequently the MIBI results revealed
anterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however the
patient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wall
which revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wall
nonfunctioning wall. These are the preliminary results. It was
decided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior to
consideration for surgery. The patient&apos;s Isordil dose was
increased while in hospital and his Coumadin was restarted.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 p.r.n. chest pain. Coumadin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s ,
and Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is being discharged in good
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Ayoub The patient is to be seen within one
week with Dr. Warmack of Gardmond Hospital for
Cardiology , and Dr. Bartolomeo of Thoracic Surgery per Dr. Ondrusek
recommendations. The patient has been chest pain free since
11/10/96 , since he had the episode of flash pulmonary edema. His
heparin was discontinued on 1/11/96. The patient remained chest
pain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.

Discharge Date: 10/9/1996
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: IDIOPATHIC HYPERTROPHY SUBAORTIC STENOSIS.
RELATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
2 ) SYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 79 year old Russian
speaking female who had had a history
of exertional chest pain and no previous documented coronary artery
disease. In July 1995 , patient was admitted to Penle Hospital for symptomatic bradycardia. She ruled out for a
myocardial infarction at that time. Echocardiogram revealed left
ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular cavity obstruction
with systolic outflow tract gradient of 20-30 mm of mercury. In
September 1995 , patient presented to the Sumri Sondoyle Hospital with complaints
of exertional chest pain with onset after one flight of stairs.
She was started on Atenolol. Echocardiogram at that time revealed
asymmetric septal hypertrophy , anterior movement of mitral valve
during systole , and peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient of
58 mm of mercury. This was consistent with the diagnosis of
idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Patient was continued
on Atenolol , however , given her history of symptomatic bradycardia ,
her dose could not be increased. One week prior to admission , the
patient noted onset of substernal chest pressure described as pain
in her anterior chest radiating to her jaw. This was usually
experienced in the late morning with no obvious relation to
exertion usually accompanied by light headedness. On the day of
admission , patient awoke without pain , however , in the a.m. , she
again noted onset of substernal chest pressure associated with
light headedness. This lasted for a period of about thirty minutes
after which time she had a syncopal event. The patient fell on her
right hip without evidence of head trauma with brief loss of
consciousness. Within seconds , she was awake and conversant. EMT
was alerted and she was brought to Rit Hospital
Emergency Department for further evaluation and management. She
denied any significant shortness of breath , fever , chills , and
sweats.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes times
twenty years , status post
pancreatectomy , IHSS , and angina.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Nifedipine XL 30 mg
p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
aspirin , and 30 units NPH insulin q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of IHSS or sudden death
documented.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient was originally from the Ist. Andfreca , former
teacher , married , and lived with husband. There
was no significant use of alcohol or tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was a pleasant elderly
female in no acute distress. She was
afebrile with a heart rate of 64 , blood pressure 114/68 ,
respiratory rate 16 , and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. HEENT:
Examination was notable for anisocoria , right pupil status post
previous surgery , and oropharynx clear without lesions. NECK:
Supple without lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention ,
carotids were without bruits , and firm mobile mass on anterior
neck. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regular
rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and III/VI late systolic murmur best heard
at the left lower sternal border. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES:
Without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination
was non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: CBC showed a hematocrit of 43.1 , white
blood count 8.6 , platelets 160 ,
electrolytes within normal limits with a potassium of 4.7 ,
BUN/creatinine 34/0.9 , liver function tests within normal limits ,
INR 1.1 , and CK 68. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.006 ,
pH 5.5 , and 1+ bacteria , chest x-ray with evidence of tortuous
aorta but no acute pulmonary or cardiac disease , and ECG showed a
sinus rhythm , left ventricular hypertrophy , early repolarization in
V1 to V3 , T wave inversion in lead I , first degree AV block ,
otherwise with normal intervals , and axis minus 39.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 79 year old female with a history of
IHSS and insulin dependent diabetes who now
presented with a syncopal episode accompanied by substernal chest
pressure. Given the patient&apos;s history of chest pain , she was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with flat CK and cardiac troponin I
of 0.0. She was placed on cardiac monitor. She was noted to have
normal sinus rhythm at a rate in the fifties to sixties increasing
as high as the nineties with exertion. As a result , the patient&apos;s
beta blocker dose was increased as tolerated with close monitoring
for possible bradycardia. Given the likelihood that her symptoms
could be related to decreased outflow secondary to IHSS , the
Pacemaker Service was consulted. It was felt that the patient
would benefit from placement of a permanent pacemaker which would
possibly be therapeutic both for IHSS as well as allowing further
titration of beta blocker for her exertional angina. The procedure
was discussed with the patient and her family in detail and her
family requested one additional evening to discuss whether or not
to proceed with pacemaker placement. She remained on cardiac
monitor and remained asymptomatic throughout her hospital course.
Clinically , the patient remained stable. She remained on cardiac
monitor given her history of daily episodes of syncope and chest
pain over the last week prior to admission. Her blood sugar was
followed closely with fingersticks q.i.d. and she was replaced with
sliding scale Regular insulin in addition to her regular NPH dose.
On 3/7/96 , the patient underwent placement of a permanent
pacemaker , mode DDDR , via her left axillary vein without
complication. The patient remained stable overnight and placement
of pacemaker was confirmed with chest x-ray.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home in stable condition.
She was instructed to notify her medical doctor for
any worsening of chest pain , light headedness , or pain at the
pacemaker site. In addition , she was instructed to check the
incision site for sign of redness as well as fever and she was told
not to shower for four days status post pacemaker placement.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg
p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. , and
Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. She will resume her previous insulin
dosing.
FOLLOW-UP: Patient will follow-up with her primary medical doctor ,
Dr. Retort , and her Cardiologist , Dr. Shorty She will
follow-up , in addition , with Dr. Orris in the Pacemaker Clinic in
approximately one month.

10. HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER STATUS POST LEFT MASTECTOMY AND
TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease ,
CRF , and history of flash pulmonary edema , recently admitted to
Darnbo Hospital on 6/9/97 after sudden onset of shortness of breath
unrelieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin. This shortness of
breath awakened her from sleep. Her blood pressure in the
Emergency Room was 230/110 without EKG changes. She responded well
to IV Lasix and IV nitroglycerin , saturating at 99% on 100%
nonrebreather mask. Chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her blood pressure was stabilized on IV nitroglycerin with
resolution of her shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction. The patient was also recently admitted one
month ago to Stonemep Medical Center for flash pulmonary edema without
evidence of myocardial infarction. Echo on admission showed 30%
ejection fraction with anteroapical and posterobasal hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization in January 1997 showed a 90% proximal RCA
lesion and diffuse distal LAD disease. During vigorous rehydration
following that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrent
pulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weaned
following diuresis. Because her pulmonary edema was believed to be
ischemia related , she was transferred to the Ha Hospital for RCA angioplasty. On this admission , she denies any
chest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. She has three
pillow orthopnea , ankle edema. She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea with the exception of her current presentation. The
patient&apos;s coronary risk factors include diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , post menopausal status without
hormone replacement therapy , and history of tobacco use. Her
exercise tolerance is such that she develops shortness of breath
with walking one block or one flight of stairs. She reports having
to sit down at every other bench in the mall.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypercholesterolemia. Total cholesterol
266 down to 193. 2. Hypertension. 3.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy seven years ago and
status post five years of Tamoxifen therapy. She has had no other
chemo or radiation treatment. 4. Depression. 5. Hypercalcemia ( no
alkalized syndrome ) 9/13 6. History of recurrent pneumonia. 7.
History of diverticulitis. 8. Glaucoma. 9. Non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus diagnosed one year ago , diet controlled. 10.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a history of pyelonephritis at age
three. 11. Mitral regurgitation. 12. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40 , hormone
replacement therapy for five years which was then discontinued
secondary to her breast cancer. 13. Status post bilateral knee
replacement.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. started three
weeks ago , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Isordil 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , Timoptic
0.25% one GTT OU b.i.d. , Serax 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia ,
and IV heparin at 1 , 300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: Tagamet causes a rash and adhesive tape.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for a history of tobacco. She quit 17
years ago. She uses no alcohol and no IV drug
use. She lives with her husband in Lau and has six children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of stomach cancer. Mother , two
aunts , and sister have history of myocardial
infarction at ages greater than 60.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has been following her weight since
her last discharge ( pulmonary edema ). She
reports a weight loss from 177 to 175 lb over the last couple of
days. She reports a 12 lb weight loss in the last month. She has
no complaints of dysuria or cough.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant female , resting
comfortably in bed. Her temperature was
98.5 , blood pressure 156/68 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , and 95% on
two liters. There was no JVD. Carotids were 1+ without bruits , no
thyromegaly , and no lymphadenopathy. Lungs revealed right basilar
crackles. She was using accessory muscles for respirations. Heart
revealed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2. There was a
II-III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the LSB. There was a III/VI
holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. There was
no S3 or S4. Her abdomen was slightly distended with no
hepatosplenomegaly. She was guaiac negative. She had 2+ femoral
pulses bilaterally without bruits and 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
There was no ankle edema. Neurological examination was grossly
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN was 59 , creatinine 3.9 , hematocrit 28.9 , and
MCV 82.3. Magnesium was 2.4. Chest x-ray from
outside hospital was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealed
normal sinus rhythm at 81 , normal axis and intervals ( QT slightly
increased at 0.46 ) , LVH , LAE. There was T flattening in AVL.
There were no acute ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was much improved after
successful diuresis with improvement
of her pulmonary examination and no evidence of right sided
failure. She was saturating well on room air. Care was taken to
diurese slowly in order to present a prerenal insult. She remained
symptom free for the duration of her hospital course.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient denies ever having had any
chest pain , but had known anatomy with single vessel disease ( RCA ).
Her history is suggestive of possible silent ischemia consistent
with her diabetic status. Her anginal equivalent appears to be
shortness of breath. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on 6/2/97 with PTCA plus stent placement to her RCA with a good
result. She is on Ticlid for two weeks. Her blood pressure was
well controlled in her target range of 140-160 systolic blood
pressure on hydralazine , Lasix , and Lopressor. The day following
cardiac catheterization , her hematocrit and creatinine remained
stable at 30.9 and 3.7 , respectively. On 7/4/97 , her creatinine
increased to 4.2. This increase was thought to be due to a
combination of prerenal insult in addition to possible
dinephropathy. She was hydrated gently and her creatinine was
watched for the next two days , stabilizing in the 4.4 to 4.5 range.
3. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Etiology was unknown , possibly
secondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertensive nephropathy. She
has history of creatinine rises to high 3s and 4s during recent
hospitalizations. Hospital course is as described above. In
addition , Axid was changed to renal dosing ( q.day ) and the patient
was treated for a urinary tract infection. In reviewing the
hospital records , there is no evidence of previous work up for
renal artery stenosis. This patient with history and physical to
control blood pressures and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension may benefit from further evaluation of possible renal
artery stenosis. This work up was deferred during this
hospitalization due to management of acute issues.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS: This was stable , diet controlled.
5. ANEMIA: The patient was worked up for her baseline low
hematocrit , found to have an iron deficiency anemia treated with
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. Given her underlying renal failure ,
there may also be a renally driven component to her anemia and she
may benefit from Epogen as an outpatient.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition to follow up
with Dr. Andre Smithe , her cardiologist , in two weeks , and her
primary care physician in one week based on previously scheduled
appointment.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , hydralazine 50 mg
p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Timoptic 0.25% one drop OU b.i.d. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.day , and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two
weeks. Also , Niferex tablet 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have her
CBC checked at two weeks and four weeks
given her Ticlid therapy.

Discharge Date: 10/11/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE NOW STATUS POST PTCA
TIMES TWO AND STENT PLACEMENT.
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS/PROBLEM LIST: Coronary artery disease status
post three vessel CABG in 1981 ,
hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypertriglyceridemia , status post total hip replacement in 1990 ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post triple hernia repair.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Flicker is a 71-year-old white
gentleman who has a history of
coronary artery disease , status post CABG in 1981 at the Sleyeepathvall Community Hospital who was transferred from Zie-tol Center
with unstable angina for further evaluation and treatment.
The patient&apos;s coronary risk factors include insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension , age , male gender ,
remote tobacco smoking and also known coronary artery disease.
The patient&apos;s cardiac history dates back to 1981 when he underwent
three vessel CABG at the Ricks Hospital . The patient
has been in his usual state of health active in the Cape O until he
noticed progressive chest pain with chest tightness and shortness
of breath , but no light-headedness , nausea or vomiting which has
been progressing over the past few months. The patient did not
occur at rest , but occurred with minimal exertion. The patient had
an EKG as an outpatient which showed ST-T wave abnormalities and he
was advised to come to the hospital.
The patient presented to the Box Ro University Hospitals Of and was heparinized.
At that time his CKs were stable and his EKG did not show any
infarction. The patient had an echocardiogram and a Persantine
thallium stress test which was remarkably positive. The patient
developed substernal chest pain after one minute. The patient was
treated with 100 milligrams of aminophylline and two sublingual
nitroglycerines. His EKG revealed 2.5 millimeter ST depression in
leads 2 , AVf and V3-V6. His thallium images showed profusion
abnormalities in the posterolateral , anterior walls and also the
septum. The septum and apex were nearly completely filling in the
rest of the images.
The patient has now been transferred to the Biee Nino Hospital for further evaluation and intervention.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included the above. He had a CABG in
1981 and by office report , had an SVG to the
LAD in D1 and also and SVG to the distal RCA on OM1.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , NPH insulin 12 units subcu q. h.s. ,
aspirin 81 milligrams p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.25
milligrams p.o. q.d. , Glucotrol 10 milligrams p.o. q. a.m. ,
gemfibrozil 600 milligrams p.o. q. h.s. , Atenolol 100 milligrams
p.o. q.d. , nitropaste 1&quot; q.8h. , IV heparin 1000 units per hour ,
Colace 100 milligrams two b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works three times a week at the I
and he has a remote history of tobacco with
smoking 1-1-1/2 packs per day for 20 years , but also quit 20 years
ago. The patient drinks infrequently , but used to drink more in
the past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease in his
sister and his brother. His brother had a CABG
at age 73.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient at this time denies any shortness
of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
orthopnea or dyspnea on exertion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.0 , heart rate 49-53 , blood
pressure 140/70 , respirations 20 , O2
saturation 96% on room air. In general , the patient seemed
comfortable. His sclera were anicteric. JVP was 5 centimeters
with good carotids. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally
from anterior. Cardiovascular: Regular with a II-III/VI harsh
crescendo , decrescendo systolic murmur in the right upper sternal
border , and also a I-II/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur in the left
lower sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities showed 1+ pitting edema
to the mid shins. Neurologically , he was alert and oriented times
three. Extraocular movement are intact. Pupils are equal , round
and reactive to light , 3-4 millimeters bilaterally. Otherwise , his
examination was grossly nonfocal , but he has mild paresthesias
distally. Reflexes are 0 at the ankles , 0 at the ankles , but
symmetric and 2+ in the upper extremities.
LABORATORY: He has a normal SMA-7. His hematocrit is 41 with
WBCs 7.9 , platelet count 163 , 000. His CK is 104. His
LFTs are within normal limits.
His electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 51 with first
degree AV block and T wave inversions in 1 and L with ST-T wave
abnormalities in V4-V6.
His chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly with mild superior vascular
redistribution.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Iamiceli was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory where a
catheterization revealed a left dominant system with a left main
that was okay and LAD was totally occluded proximally. The left
circumflex had 30% stenosis with 4-50% distal stenosis of the
bifurcation of the left PDA , also with a PDA of 80% lesion with PLV
of 40% and OM1 with a tubular 40% lesion. The RCA was totally
occluded at the ostial region , this was old. SVG to the LAD
looked okay , but the LAD itself distally had 90% lesions. The SVG
to the PDA to OM1 was totally occluded. The SVG to the diagonal
had a 95% ostial lesion. There was no MR. A PTCA was performed
with an SVG to the diagonal also with two 3.5 PS stents placed
resulting in 0% residual.
Also noted by Dr. Keyl , is that the operative notes from Nas Louskoci Prinbap General Hospital from 1981 says that there are two skip SVG
to the PDA to the OM1 , also SVG to the D1 , to the LAD which is
incorrect. There are actually separate SVGs to LAD and to D1 and a
third SVG must be totally occluded to the PDA to OM1.
After the catheterization , the patient was admitted to the
Cardiology Cleve Ti Er , Georgia 46841 Team where he continued to be heparinized and
supported with rate control awaiting a second cardiac
catheterization which was to correct the distal LAD lesions. The
patient had an unremarkable hospital course and underwent his
second cardiac catheterization and PTCA on 10/15/97 which resulted
in the two distal LAD lesions which were each 90%. The patient
underwent PTCA to a residual of 10-20%.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and subsequently had a
very small left groin hematoma , but was otherwise okay. He
remained afebrile with stable vital signs and was discharged on
9/20/97 in good stable condition.
DISPOSITION/FOLLOW UP: The patient was discharged in good and
stable condition on 4/3/97. He will
follow up with Dr. Errol Turgeon in 1-2 weeks. The patient also
will return to have his blood drawn for a CBC check in two weeks
and also in four weeks because he is discharged on Ticlid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o.
q.d. , Atenolol 100 milligrams p.o. q.d. ,

**********************hospital course***************************
1. PULM: admitted with mild worsening of chronic hypoxia related to
restrictive lung disease , obesity hypoventilation and obstructive sleep
apnea. Her baseline home oxygen requirement in 5-6L by nasal cannula
along with nasal BiPAP at night 16/8. She had decompensated to 7-8Lnc
and was complaining of dyspnea , both of which resolved with iv lasix
and 2-3liters negative diuresis. She is chronically deconditioned and
obese and refused to go to a rehabilitation facility , even pulmonary
rehab.
2. CV: followed by Dr. Seling of cardiology; diuresed with iv lasix and
diamox with bicard between 30-35 during admission. No active ichemic i
ssue or arrhythmias noted during admission. Discharged on home
diuretic regimen of 80mg lasix po qd with instructed to take an extra
pill once if she feels like her ankles are swelling or she is
particularly short of breath and no phone her physician.
3. ID: CXR negative for infiltrate , no fever no cough and no evidence
of pneumonia. Ms. Boerner had her influenza vaccination this year
already.
4. Social: SW consulted , patient lives alone , has no support network
and is chronically noncompliant with medical and dietary
recommendations. Cardiac and pulmonary social work have both been
involved in her care in the past. PT consulted and recommended
pulmonary rehab , but patient refused. Her primary support is from an
internet friend who lives in Reve Ins and despite bargaining with staff
about which medicines to take and when to discharge her , she was well
enough to go on her scooter to visit &quot;friends&quot; in the hospital and get
high salt food from Connecticut She was discharged in stable condition with
oxygen back to her baseline levels of 96% on 5l nc and will follow up
with her pcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to eat a low salt , low total fluid diet. Follow up with your
primary care physician , you cardiology and your hematologist as
necessary. There are no increased oxygen requirements at this time. If
you feel like your ankles are swelling or you are having trouble
breathing , please take one extra lasix pill and call your physician for
further instructions.

Discharge Date: 10/17/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 76 year old woman with
asthma. Presenting problem was
shortness of breath. Problem list included anxiety , status post
cholecystectomy in 1988 , headaches , asthma , hypertension , vertigo ,
question of pneumonia in February 1996. Patient&apos;s cardiac risk
factors included a history of hypertension , she had no known
history of elevated cholesterol , she did not smoke , and had no
history of diabetes or family history of cardiac disease. She had
no prior myocardial infarction and no history of angina. The
patient did have a history of asthma with no prior hospitalizations
or steroid tapers. She did take p.o. Proventil at night and there
were no pulmonary function tests available on record. Two days
prior to admission , the patient noted sudden onset of inability to
sleep secondary to shortness of breath when lying down. The
patient tried her inhaler without relief of symptoms. She also
noted an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient denied
fevers or chills. She reported that her symptoms did not improve
during the day and the night prior to admission , the patient noted
shortness of breath on exertion. She denied chest pain or chest
pressure. She had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or light
headedness. The patient presented to Bellmarle Medical Center
Emergency Department for persistent inability to sleep. On
evaluation in the Emergency Room , her blood pressure was 136/75
with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%
on room air. She was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg of
intravenous Lasix. She put out 600 cc of urine to that Lasix. The
Emergency Department then attempted to give her Verapamil 5 mg
times three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.
The patient had no prior history of cardiac event. Her last
exercise test was in 1993. She went three minutes and five seconds
on the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. Her
maximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.
She had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her EKG
were not interpretable.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , Proventil tablet 4 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Habits included that patient did not drink alcohol
and she did not smoke cigarettes. Patient lived
at home with her family who were very involved with her care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was an elderly Hispanic woman in no
acute distress. Vital signs included a
temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , and
respiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.
HEENT: Examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.
CHEST: Showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up without
wheezes and no focal findings or egophony. CARDIAC: Examination
showed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal S1 and
S2 , no murmurs , and no S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Showed a well healed
surgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no
hepatojugular reflux. EXTREMITIES: Without edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was within normal limits with a BUN
of 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , CBC showed
a white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.
CK was 110 and troponin was 0.0. Chest x-ray showed increased
heart size with bilateral increased interstitial markings
consistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascular
redistribution. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats per
minute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a left
bundle-branch block , and no significant changes since 5/6/97.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for new onset congestive
heart failure. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. On the second day of hospitalization , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test MIBI on which she went four minutes and
eleven seconds on a modified Bruce protocol. She stopped secondary
to fatigue. She denied chest pain , there were no EKG changes , and
she had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia
with exercise. Nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptake
in the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidence
of ongoing ischemia. An echocardiogram was also performed that
revealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She had mild mitral calcification
with mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and a
normal right ventricular size and function. It was determined that
the patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropy
given her poor ejection fraction. She was started on Captopril ,
Digoxin , and Isordil in addition to the Lasix she had received upon
presentation for her congestive heart failure. The patient
tolerated these medications well and maintained a systolic blood
pressure of approximately 100 without symptoms of orthostasis.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil tablets 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , Digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets taking one sublingually q.5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Serax 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , K-Dur 20 mEq
p.o. q.d. , and Lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician , Dr. Rheaves , at Sharp Statepark Rehab in
Ston Dr. Jankoff will adjust her medications as
necessary and will arrange for an out-patient Holter monitor to
follow-up with nonsustained run of supraventricular tachycardia
during her exercise stress test.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 81M with a h/o CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG , redo LIMA to LAD ,
and PCIx4 admitted w/ 2 month h/o increasingly frequent exertional CP.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Stathes reports increasingly frequent exertional CP over the past 2
months that has been occurring about twice daily for the past 2 weeks.
Described as sub-sternal pressure , 5/10 , w/o radiation , and relieved
within 10-15 minutes of rest. Now occurring w/ walking 2-3 blocks at a
normal pace. Also describes near daily CP upon waking up , relieved
within 30 minutes of resting. Has not been taking sl. nitro. CP not
associated w/ SOB , nausea/vomiting , nor diaphoresis. No PND , orthopnea ,
palpitations , nor LE swelling.
For evaluation of these symptoms , he underwent a cardiac MRI , myocardial
perfusion w/ adenosine stress that was abnormal. Cardiac cath. was
recommended , but he sought a 2nd opinion at an MHMC in A On
arrival to this MMH on 10/27 , he was found to be diaphoretic and
orthostatic w/ an SBP as low as 70. He was thought to be volume-depleted
and admitted for further evaluation. No EKG changes were noted and
cardiac enzymes were negativex3. It was recommended to proceed to
cardiac cath. at AAMHC . He chose to come to KNMC ( b/c all of his cardiac
care in the past has been here ) and was transferred on 10/9 for elective
cardiac cath.
No CP , nor SOB at admission.

10. PCI: SVG TO MARG2 TO 0% W/ A 3.5 mm CYPHER POSTDILATED TO 4.0 mm
W/ GOOD RESULT.
Received ASA and lipitor throughout his course. Briefly on integrillin
gtt following catheterization , but discontinued following a
retroperitoneal bleed ( see below ). Had recurrent CP w/ ambulation on 6/16
- isordil was held in the AM , restarted in PM. No EKG changes. Discharged
on isrodil and toprol XL. Should be converted to imdur and uptitrated as
necessary
2. CARDS PUMP: Hypotensive on 10/27 likely 2/2 volume depletion. Was
orthostatic again on 10/5 AM following lasix and flomax. Again on 6/16
developed orthostatic hypotension after sustaining blood loss from
retroperitoneal blood; not symptomatic on 4/30 Encouraged po intake and
held BP medications on 6/16 AM. Recommend that flomax be held
indefinitely; have restarted lasix 40 mg po qdaily at discharge ( should

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75 year old with a long
history of coronary artery disease who
presents with unstable angina.
The patient has a long history of stable and unstable angina ,
suffered a nonQ-wave myocardial infarction 2 of July
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1978 - myocardial infarction. 1980 -
coronary artery bypass graft with porcine
mitral valve replacement. Saphenous vein grafts were performed on
the LAD , PDA arteries. 1991 - Repeat coronary artery bypass graft
because of recurrent angina , LIMA to LAD graft. 16 of August - Laser
angioplasty. 16 of February - Laser angioplasty. 28 of May - Episodes of TIA ,
seizures and was begun on Coumadin. 1 of May - Abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair , nonQ-wave myocardial infarction by enzymes at
Soundbellley Coursi Medical Center .
Since July 1995 he has had worsening of his angina to the point
where he had it several times a week while walking very short
distances. He required prophylactic nitroglycerin before walking.
In the week prior to admission , the angina increased to several
times a day , requiring 2 or 3 nitroglycerins for relief where as
before required only 1.
On the day prior to admission , he had recurrent chest pain which
was unresponsive to nitroglycerin. He presents originally to the
Troga Seph&apos;snob Memorial Hospital Health Services ER where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin
and heparin and had recurring chest pain.
He was transferred to Stownhu Palio General Medical Center for further
management.
At the Er Hney University Hospital he ruled in for myocardial
infarction with CKs in the low 300s , MB of 29.8. He was taken to
the cath lab where an angiography showed an occluded left
circumflex and an occluded LAD path of the first diagonal and
occluded proximal RCA , occluded saphenous vein graft to the LAD and
occluded saphenous vein graft to his OM and patent LIMA to LAD and
saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As summarized above under significant
problems.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM RELAND HOSPITAL : Isordil 20
t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Dilantin
100 t.i.d. , proscar 5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 2 mg q.d. , IV heparin and IV
TNG.
ALLERGIES: None known.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his wife , former employee of the
Corp Codelping Sta
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Elderly , moderately obese man
in no current distress. Heart rate is 63 to
75 , blood pressure 108/64 , R 10-14. HEENT - Within normal limits.
Neck - No jugular venous distention. CV - Regular rate and rhythm
with a systolic 1/6 murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Lungs - Crackles 1/3 of the way up.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission - Normal electrolytes , creatinine ,
CBC - hematocrit 35 , platelets 43 , 000 , PT/PTT
19.2 and 6.1 , respectively. CK were 311 and 333.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CCU and was taken
to the Cardiac Cath Lab with cardiac
catheterization as detailed above. The decision at that time was
made that his findings were not amenable to angioplasty or to
surgical intervention. He was put on an intra-aortic balloon pump
following catheterization. Medications were increased to relieve
after load and decreased ischemia.
His course in the CCU was notable for continued episodes of chest
pain and difficulty weaning from the intra-aortic balloon pump. He
was seen by the cardiac surgery team and they did not feel he was
amenable to revascularization. In addition , he was not a candidate
for laser revascularization protocol under Dr. Stusse and that
protocol was closed.
On 8 of June the patient was successfully weaned from intra-aortic
balloon pump and did not have further chest pain at that time. He
was at this point using SL nitroglycerin prophylactically. On 24 of June
the patient was transferred to Cardiology A Service.
On the floor , the patient continued to have episodes of chest pain
up to 2 or 3 times a day which were relieved with nitroglycerin SL.
On 14 of August he had more severe episode of chest pain refractory to 3
nitroglycerin and eventually improved with 6 mg of morphine and 10
mg of IV Lopressor. His pain had occurred at rest and lasted a
total of approximately one hour. After this event , the angioplasty
team was reconsulted concerning the possibility of addressing some
of the patient&apos;s cardiac lesions. It was agreed that this is a
high risk procedure but after extensive discussion with him and his
family; both decided to attempt an angioplasty of his LAD lesion.
He was briefly admitted to the HYJU for intra-aortic balloon pump
prior to the procedure and subsequently on 26 of November underwent PTCA of
his distal LAD to a 30% residual stenosis. He also underwent PTCA
of his proximal LAD to residual 20% stenosis. He was successfully
and rapidly weaned from the intra-aortic balloon pump and
readmitted to the cardiology Dabri Hwy. , Loschusonhass , New York 85015 service on 16 of August
The patient&apos;s subsequent course was characterized by decreasing
episodes of chest pain. He began to ambulate in his room and
subsequently around the Ci without chest pain. He continued
throughout final week of hospitalization to have one episode of
chest pain on awakening , always relieved with 1 SL nitroglycerin
and occasionally relieved without any nitroglycerin.
On 24 of April , the patient was in good condition without angina ,
walking around the Stara Shing Ford and scheduled to be transferred to Maho Hospital He has also undergone anticoagulation
with Coumadin for his dyskinesis. He is discharged with a good
INR. He has upon discharge a 24 hour Holter monitor that is
pending which was performed to evaluate his pacer function.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg

Discharge Date: 10/24/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Asthma exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
4. Sleep apnea.
5. Hypertension.
6. Obesity.
7. Tobacco history.
HISTORY: A 61-year-old female with a long tobacco
history of COPD , and recently diagnosed
sleep apnea is admitted with an asthma flare. In 1981 , she had a
DVT which required IVC filter placement. In 1983 , she had a
nonQ-wave MI and cath at that time showed an 80% proximal LAD
stenosis , 30% RCA stenosis treated medically. In October of 1991 ,
the patient had an exercise test in which she went four minutes
in 28 seconds , stopped because of fatigue and there were no
diagnostic EKG changes. PFT&apos;s at that time were reportedly
normal , although details are not available at this time.
In July of 1991 , further evaluation of the patient&apos;s dyspnea
included multiple normal EKG&apos;s , a low probable VQ scan. She was
treated with steroids and inhalers ( Bronchosol ) with good relief.
In September 1991 , the patient had recurrent dyspnea on exertion. She
ruled out for an MI at Jeanes Medical Center . Repeat Cath
showed an LAD stenosis of 40% , RCA of 80% and an ejection
fraction of 73%. She was discharged on medical management.
In February of 1991 , the patient was diagnosed with &quot;asthma&quot;/COPD
and had another rule out MI for dyspnea. At that time , she had
another ETT in which she went four minutes and 45 seconds ,
stopped secondary to chest pain , however , the EKG was
nondiagnostic. Thallium showed fixed anterior defects ( although
the effects overlying breast tissue cannot be ruled out ).
Bronchoscopy showed mild bronchitis and , since that time , she was
discharged on a prednisone taper which had gradually been tapered
down to 11 mg a day.
Of note , the patient also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea for
which she is on nasal CPAP. She sleeps in a chair due to
orthopnea and occasionally has paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The most recent pulmonary function tests ( January 1992 ) showed an
FEV1 of 1.76 , an FVC of 2.5 , ratio of 70% , DLCO of 28.3. A
twenty-four holter was negative for arrhythmias. Exercise test
at that time , she went nine minutes and had no ST changes.
Thallium images were again unremarkable.
One week prior to admission , the patient developed symptoms of
upper respiratory infection including sneezing , rhinorrhea ,
headache and had increased shortness of breath. Steroids were
increased as were nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Over
the five days prior to admission , the patient had increasing
shortness of breath , wheezing worse at night. She denies fevers ,
chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , abdominal pain ,
cough , rash or joint pain.
In the Emergency Room , the patient was in marked respiratory
distress for which she was given nebulizer and begun on IV Solu-
Medrol. Peak flow at that time was 180.
Past medical history , COPD , coronary artery disease status post
nonQ-wave MI 1983. Obesity. Sleep apnea. Allergic rhinitis.
Status post cholecystectomy. Benign breast cyst resection.
History of labyrinthitis. History of Sjogren&apos;s disease with a
positive anti DNA antibody. History of DVT status post IVC
filter in 1983.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa has caused swollen mouth ,
Theophylline causes jitteriness.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizers t.i.d.; Kay-Ciel
8 mEq q.d.; Prednisone 11 mg q.d.;
Guanfacine 600 mg b.i.d.; Verapamil 240 SR q.d.; Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d. ( q.d. if feels okay ). Cromolyn nebs q. 6 hours ( rarely
uses ); Nasobid inhaler b.i.d.; Ranitidine q. h.s. HABITS:
Tobacco history , quit approximately two years ago , rare alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Obese , pleasant female in mild shortness
of breath initially but responded to
nebs and steroids. Otopharynx was clear. There was no thrush.
NECK: Supple. Carotids 2+. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and
rhythm , very distant. LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at bases ,
scant wheezes , no crackles. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender.
EXTREMITIES: Obese , no marked edema , although difficult to
assess secondary to obesity. SKIN: No visible lesion.
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly within normal limits.
LABORATORY DATA: Potassium 3.6 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 ,
white count 15.1 , urinalysis negative.
Chest X-ray , no significant disease except for a question of mild
CHF changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with IV
steroids , nebulizers , oxygen , and did
quite well. The trigger for her asthma remains illusive. She
underwent an esophageal acid study to rule out subclinical
aspiration ( results pending at the time of discharge ). There was
no infectious component to her exacerbation detected , although
preceding viral illness cannot be excluded. The patient was
treated with subcutaneous Heparin for DVT risks.
On hospital day number four , the patient was converted to
Prednisone without complications. She had no episodes of chest
pain and there was no evidence for ischemic etiology.
At the time of discharge , the patient&apos;s peak flows were greater
than 500 and her lung exam had cleared remarkably. She is
transferred to Foflotroy Hospital for respiratory
rehabilitation on the following medications: Aspirin one tablet
p.o. q.d.; Atrovent puffers two puffs q. 4 hours; Beconase nasal
inhaler two puffs q. 6 hours; Heparin 10 , 000 units subcutaneous
b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg q. h.s.; Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. d. ( taper
as tolerated ); Albuterol nebulized treatments q. 4 hours as
needed; Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Verapamil SR 240 mg p.o. q.d.;
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. a.m. p.r.n.; Beclovent neb six puffs p.o.
q.i.d.
ADDENDUM:
Regarding the patient&apos;s esophagram results , the patient had a
48-hour esophageal pH monitor which showed that the patient has
reflux episodes and parameters which are within normal limits;
however , 4/7 cough episodes are correlated with the patient&apos;s
cough and asthma flares are possibly related to her reflux
symptoms; however , the study was not completely diagnostic.
Benefit from anti-reflux medications such as Reglan on a
diagnostic and therapeutic trial , we should also consider further
gastroesophageal reflux studies such as manometry as an
outpatient.

25. Urinalysis was cloudy , large LE , 3+ bacteria , 40-50 white
blood cells. ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation with a
moderate ventricular response , occasional PVCs apparently
conducted diffuse nonspecific ST-T abnormalities , left axis
deviation , no prior EKG for comparison.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Chest x-ray performed on 1/1/2006
by Freeman Ziesman showing mild pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram
performed on 1/1/2006 by Gavin Heltsley showing no significant
change from previous done 8/10/2003. Ejection fraction of 25% ,
left atrium 5 cm mildly enlarged , global hypokinesia , no obvious
thrombi , PA SBP 57 mmHg. EEG performed on 5/25/2006 by Pat Byford was consistent with mild encephalopathy of toxic ,
metabolic , traumatic , or other origins. No definitive , focal , or
epileptiform features. Previous EEG done on 9/17/2006 revealed
similar findings. Head CT on 5/25/2006 by Lanny Chiarito showed
prominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for the
patient&apos;s age. No acute intracranial process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with an elevated
BNP and chest x-ray consistent with CHF flare , likely secondary
to UTI. On arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic. EKG and one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medications
were restarted. On examination , the patient had elevated JVP and
edema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. The patient
responded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg IV and metolazone 2.5
mg by mouth. He was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mg
p.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. Echocardiogram was
performed on 5/25/2006 to rule out structure etiologies for CHF
flare. Results showed no significant change from previous echo
done on 6/27/2006. The patient was on telemetry during the
hospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation with
premature ventricular contractions. He remained asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.
2. ID: UTI contributing to his CHF flare and MS changes.
Urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reported
Gram-negative rods. The patient was continued on a 10-day course
of p.o. Levaquin. TP-IgG was negative.
3. Pulmonary: Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. The patient remained asymptomatic
with no oxygen requirement. The patient responded well to
diuretic therapy for CHF flare.
4. Neurology: The patient&apos;s altered mental status was thought
to be secondary to urinary tract infection without metabolic
causes. B12 , folate , TSH , and T4 were within normal limits.
TP-IgG was negative. Iron was slow with small hypochromia on
smear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. EEG was also performed
on 5/25/2006 as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitive
function that could be related to seizure activity. EEG was
nondiagnostic for epileptiform features. The patient was started
on Keppra 500 mg twice a day. His mental status appeared to be at baseline at
time of discharge
5. Renal: Creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitored
during diuresis. Creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.
Gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary to
patient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. Bladder
scan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated to
remove clots. As the patient&apos;s mental status improved , he no
longer pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. He
continued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary to
BPH and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.
6. Wounds: The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the left
Achilles , recently seen at Usccaialt Hospital by Dr.
Kampmann , Plastic Surgery. He saw the patient and recommended
Panafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. The
patient will follow up with Dr. Ousley as an outpatient.
7. GI: Distended abdomen with question of ascites. LFTs
returned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.
8. Hematology: Hematuria as described above which resolved with
improved mental status. The patient&apos;s hematocrit remained stable
throughout the hospital course. The patient has a history of
elevated INR , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin K.
Records from Eym Medical Center suggest that the patient has factor
VII deficiency. The patient had no episodes of uncontrollable
bleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.
9. Endocrine: Continued the patient&apos;s home dose of Synthroid.
Diabetes type 2 covered Lantus 10 units and insulin aspart
sliding scale.
10: Fen: Potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,
low salt diet.
11. Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor , Lovenox.
12. Code: The patient is DNR/DNI. There were no complications.

Discharge Date: 5/21/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. Poorly controlled hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Fjeseth is a 62-year-old woman with
cardiac risk factors of hypertension ,
diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary disease
documented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented with
increased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last three
months and who was seen in Clinic on February , 1996 , by Dr.
Glod , and was admitted for management. She had a myocardial
infarction in 1981 and , in September 1995 , she had a three vessel CABG
which included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous vein
grafts to the OM and to the PDA. In April 1995 , her postoperative
course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion
which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a
thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and
drainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic on
exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On April , 1995 ,
she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left
ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch
block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral
calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.
A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. She also
presented with some biventricular failure and diuresis was
attempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. Over the past two
months , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gained
approximately 21 lb since February , 1995. She has been quite
active and not limited. However , the edema has been her most
limiting factor. Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspnea
on exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chest
pain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate some
of the edema. She had no orthopnea. She claims to have no dietary
indiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chest
pain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , but
she was more fatigued. On February , 1996 , she was seen in Clinic
by Dr. Denet and was seen to have increased leg edema and
increased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. An echo was
performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an
EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in
April 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented
0.4 , which was negative. Echo report also showed some inferior
posterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspid
insufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PA
pressures of about 41 mmHg. The patient was subsequently admitted
for management of her congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertension
with systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control ,
diabetes for which she has been on insulin. She has a history of
an amaurosis fugax in September 1995 and was started on Coumadin in January
1995. She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and a
history of TIA while being on Coumadin. She also has a history of
kidney stones.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in
1993 , and right mastoid surgery.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin NPH
35 units q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Procardia XL 30 mg p.o.
p.r.n. , and Slow KCl.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother who had a myocardial
infarction at age 40 and 60. Father died of a
myocardial infarction at age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman ,
totally edematous , who was slightly short of
breath while talking. Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure
211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on room
air. Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venous
pulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. Her
carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there was
a right CEA scar. Her chest examination was significant for few
crackles at bilateral bases. Cardiac examination showed a normal
S1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positive
fluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upper
quadrant. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to knees
bilaterally. DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses were
unable to be palpated. Her weight , at the time of admission , was
233 lb.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the time
of admission. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of
64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentially
since September 1995. Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increased
interstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleural
effusion. There was also some left lower lobe scarring and there
was an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent with
increased initial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for the
first three hospital days , during which she lost
approximately 17 lb. She was then switched to p.o. Lasix on
hospital day four , and continued to diurese. She was placed on
strict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. Her blood
pressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1
blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. Her
calcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diurese
her. Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPH
dose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlled
an CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. By
hospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneous
q.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n.
chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. ,
ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days.
COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from her
Foley catheter and produced some bloody urine and
then upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of her
urine for which a urinalysis was performed. She was placed on
ofloxacin for three days.
DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. Mancha on January ,
1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. She
is also to follow up with Kelley Tallie , her nurse at Ver Hospital to
follow up on her blood sugar control. The patient will also have a
VNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check ,
weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will be
called in to Dr. Heglar She should also improve upon her
physical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.

6. GOUT.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: On 4/25/98 , cardiac catheterization and
echocardiogram.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Cliff Lucas Man Mcnease is a 52 year old Asian
male with known coronary artery
disease and extensive cardiac history , including: ( 1 ) In 1988 , the
patient had a CABG x2 vessels ( LIMA to LAD and RIMA to PDA ); ( 2 )
PTCA to PDA in 1994; ( 3 ) PTCA of LAD ( proximal to LIMA and left
circumflex ) including stent in 10/6 The patient discharged
himself AMA at that time. ( 4 ) The patient was admitted on 10/17/98
for symptoms consistent with CHF. He had a dobutamine MIBI at that
time , which was markedly positive with significant ST changes in
the inferior leads. He underwent a cardiac catheterization , where
a 90% long instant restenosis was found in the left circumflex.
The area was rotablated , and then angioplastied. During the
procedure , the patient experienced episodes of asystole. A V-pacer
was placed. The pacer was D/C&apos;d the next morning , and the patient
was discharged home on 11/17/98.
Since that time , the patient states he has been pain free , except
when he exercises on the treadmill. He , therefore , takes one
sublingual nitroglycerin before and one after the treadmill.
However , the patient now reports that he has developed rest angina
over the past two weeks. The patient states that he has q. day
rest pain , with approximately 1-3 episodes per day relieved by one
sublingual nitroglycerin and lasting for minutes of each episode.
On the day of admission , the patient presented to his primary care
doctor at HEH for upper respiratory infection symptoms , which
started approximately on 7/15/98. The patient felt chest pain
again while walking up the stairs to his doctor&apos;s office. He
reported this to the doctor , and was sent to Cater Hospital for further evaluation.
On presentation , he denies nausea , vomiting , or arm tingling. He
does report occasional shortness of breath and intermittent
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ? no orthopnea. He sleeps with one
pillow. His other review of systems was positive for productive
cough over the past week , yellow phlegm , no fevers or chills ,
diarrhea , or other. He was pain free in the Emergency Room. The
patient was therefore admitted with a diagnosis of unstable angina
for further evaluation. He was heparinized in the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease status post a
CABG in 1988; ( 2 ) PTCA in 1994; ( 3 ) Status
post rotablation in 11/25 ( 4 ) Hyperlipidemia; ( 5 ) Focal/segmental
glomerulosclerosis. His peak creatinine was 3.4 after his last
dye; ( 6 ) Chronic renal insufficiency; ( 7 ) Gout; ( 8 ) Status post lap
cholecystectomy in 1997; ( 9 ) No history of diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Lopressor 100 mg p.o.

years and quit years ago. No alcohol or other
drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sister status post CABG.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temp 97.8 , heart rate 67 , BP
146/98 , satting 95% on two liters. GENERAL:
This is an Asian male in no apparent distress. HEENT: His eyes
were anicteric , PERRL , EOMI. Oropharynx showed moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP approximately 10-11 cm of water , with no
bruit. HEART: He had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur in the
right and left upper sternal border , and positive S4 , no S3.
LUNGS: Rales 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up on the left side. The right
was clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Obese. He had bowel sounds
and no masses. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He
had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray was a poor film. It was an AP done
only. It showed no obvious infiltrates. EKG
showed sinus brady- , with first degree AV block and no acute ST or
T-wave changes. Laboratories on admission showed a BUN and
creatinine of 9 and 1.4. White count 6.37 , hematocrit 43 ,
platelet count 146. CK 90 , troponin-I 0.06. His protein was 12.3 ,
INR 1.1 , PTT 32.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Sunier was subsequently admitted for R/O MI , and
unstable angina. The patient was did R/O for MI
by EKG and enzymes. He was heparinized and continued on all of his
medications that he presented on , and he was also continued on
nitropaste sliding scale to keep him pain free.
On hospital day #1 , the nitropaste was taken off , given that the
patient had a headache. In the evening , however , the cross-cover
intern was called as the patient developed 4 out of 10 chest pain
with deep breathing , which the patient stated felt like his typical
angina. Therefore , the nitropaste was restarted and the patient
was pain free within approximately two minutes.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on hospital day #2 , which
showed an EF of 60-65% , 1+ MR , and borderline inferior hypokinesis.
He had an ETT MIBI done on 9/17/98. He exercise approximately 9
minutes and 45 seconds and stopped secondary to his chest pain and
fatigue. His peak heart rate was 89 , and BP 170/98. He had
horizontal downsloping of 1 mm , ST depression in the inferior leads
and V5-V6 , which was persistent in recovery. He got one sublingual
nitroglycerin given. On the images , it showed: ( 1 ) Moderate to
severe ischemia of the inferior wall and the posterior septum ( RCA )
7 out of 20 segments; ( 2 ) Mild ischemia of the anterior wall and
septum ( LAD ) 4 out of 20 segments; ( 3 ) An EF of 59%. The patient
was continued on heparin , nitropaste , and aspirin , and was sent for
cardiac catheterization on hospital day #3. Cardiac
catheterization showed: ( 1 ) A left main which was okay;
( 2 ) Totally occluded RCA; ( 3 ) Totally occluded LAD after the D1;
( 4 ) His left circ was 30-40% with a mid instant occlusion; ( 5 ) LIMA
to LAD was patent; ( 6 ) A treated LIMA , gaze TNG arrow patent;
( 7 ) Status post RIMA PTCA/stenting with significant spasm of the
entire RIMA. The patient , therefore , had a LIMA to PTCA stenting
performed and underwent some vasospasm on cardiac catheterization.
However , he was given Isordil and nifedipine for the spasm , which
resolved. The patient was in stable condition and pain free after
the catheterization and did not develop any complications such as a
hematoma or otherwise.
The patient was discharged to his home on 9/19/99 in stable
condition.

SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use reported.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98 , blood pressure 128/70 ,
pulse 75. Obese middle aged female in no
acute distress. HEENT was atraumatic , normocephalic. Neck was
supple with no bruits. Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed distant heart sounds ,
irregularly irregular. Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended ,
morbid obesity. Normal active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
healing right shin superficial wound , 1+ edema bilaterally.
Neurologic exam showed mental status , orientation , attention and

nerves right pupil irregular but reacts 2.5 to 2. Left pupil
irregular status post iridectomy. Visual fields intact. Right eye
slightly adducted at rest without diplopia. Mild decreased
abduction and adduction on the right without diplopia , even on
extreme gaze. No nystagmus. Unable to converge fully with the
right eye. No facial droop. Cranial nerves otherwise intact. Gag
present. Able to swallow without difficulty. Motor showed normal
tone and power to confrontation , symmetric bulk , ? slight slowing.
No clear pronator drift. Tendon reflexes trace brachialis , 2+
biceps , no triceps , trace knee reflexes , no ankle jerks. Equivocal
toes bilaterally. Sensation is notable for decreased vibration
sense , left greater than right at the toes , intact position sense
symmetric. Symmetric exam to temperature and light touch. ?
cerebellar exam with mild dysmetria on finger to nose on the left ,
Romberg stable with slight swaying to the left. Gait slow with
small steps , but fairly steady.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs showed sodium 143 , potassium 4.6 ,
chloride 100 , bicarb 29 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose 67 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit
36 , platelets 222 , PT 17 , INR 2.3 , PTT 32. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no acute changes noted. Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiomegaly , no congestive heart failure or infiltrate. Head CT
showed movement artifact with no obvious CVA , ? hypodensity in the
right upper pons but likely artifact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with symptoms of
vertical diplopia and unsteadiness/imbalance ,
falling to the left , with improvement overnight. Patient still had
an abduction defect with her right eye on the morning after
admission and mild leftward gait unsteadiness , but her vertical
diplopia had resolved. The patient was continued to be monitored.
Her blood pressure was followed. Patient was kept on Coumadin.
Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significant
size. Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI in
Well Deh Ny On 3 of August , patient underwent MRI with particular
interest in visualization of the posterior fossa. No acute infarct
or hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. The patient was continued on
her Coumadin. Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of
17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. Initially , her INR went down slightly
on 3 of August to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in the
week. On 17 of July , patient reported feeling back to her baseline of
one week ago. Patient denied any new symptoms. Patient denied
further imbalance or vertical diplopia. Patient was thought to
have had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although no
stroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient&apos;s left side
suggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explain
the diplopia. Patient probably had a very small vessel stroke/TIA.
Patient has known major risk factors for both small vessel and
large vessel and cardioembolic disease. Patient was discharged to
continue further risk factor modification in the outpatient clinic.
Patient is to continue her cardiac medical regimen. Patient will
continue with Coumadin for a goal INR of 2-3 for her chronic atrial
fibrillation. Patient was discharged on 5 of March She was
instructed to call SMER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL on Monday morning to schedule an
appointment with her primary care physician within the next 10
days. Patient is discharged in stable condition.

Discharge Date: 2/3/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND
MIXED MITRAL VALVE DISEASE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Reda is an 87 year-old
woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , mitral regurgitation and multiple sclerosis. She
has been complaining of chest pain and pressure on exertion as well
as dyspnea on exertion associated with limitation of activity and
increasing sublingual nitroglycerin use for the six to seven months
prior to admission. Of note , the patient developed atrial
fibrillation , atrial flutter back in October , 1995. An
echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an ejection fraction of
40% , inferior hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and a
left atrial size of 6.1 centimeters. The patient required
hospitalization in October , 1996 , for congestive heart failure. She
returned to the hospital in February , 1996 , with complaints of chest
pain at rest and shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction at Tol Hospital and transferred to
Ana Vinerl Hospital , where she refused cardiac
catheterization. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45% , inferior , posterior and anterior septal
hypokinesis , mild to moderate mitral stenosis and moderate mitral
regurgitation. Again , there was left atrial enlargement measured
at 6.1 centimeters. The patient returned home and was doing well
until February , 1996 , when she developed headache , chest pain and
shortness of breath. She again presented to Beth&apos;s Community Memorial Hospital where
she was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was stabilized
and transferred to Crithouse County Medical Center for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
status post anterior myocardial infarction.
Mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis. Atrial fibrillation.
Hypertension. Hypothyroidism. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

History of left humeral fracture. She is status post appendectomy ,
cholecystectomy , and laser therapy for retinal disease of the right
eye.
ALLERGIES: Erythromycin , which causes vomiting and hypertension ,
as well as to sulfa drugs which cause vomiting. She
has a possible allergy to penicillin as well.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Synthroid 100 micrograms p.o. q.d.;
Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Axid 150
milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;

p.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin alternating 1 and 2 milligrams q.d. On
transfer , the patient was also on intravenous heparin and
Nitropaste.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and retired. She has no smoking
or alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in atrial fibrillation at a rate of
83. Her blood pressure is 100/60 and is 95%
on room air. HEENT: Significant for upper and lower dentures
without any oropharyngeal lesions. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotid
pulses and no bruits. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbing
or edema. There are varicosities in bilateral lower extremities
with minimal varicosities over the thigh areas. There is bilateral
knee swelling. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL:
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN is 35 , creatinine 1.5. White blood cell count
8.3. Hematocrit 32. PT 11.9 , PTT 28.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Jeffganlanda Py Docweli Skiffle Community Hospital Cardiology Service , where she
was maximized medically. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on January , 1996 , where she was noted to have
right coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% and
distally had 80%. Finally , 90% with subtotal occlusion after the
posterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery
had 40% stenosis after diagonal 1. Diagonal 1 itself had 90%
stenosis in the mid portion. The left circumflex had a 70%
stenosis at the mid portion and another 70% stenotic area at the
distal portion. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated
at 45%. Inferior hypokinesis was noted as was 3-4+ mitral
regurgitation. Right atrial pressures were 6 , right ventricle was
52/10 , pulmonary artery 52/22 , with mean of 33 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 27 and left ventricle was 160/16. The patient
was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary artery
bypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. On March , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descending
artery. She also had mitral valve replacement with 31 millimeter
Hancock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred postoperatively to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on
nitroglycerin , Dopamine drip. She was weaned to extubate without
difficulty. She was restarted on Captopril and digoxin as well as
Coumadin. The patient had minimal response to diuretics ,
associated with a rise in her creatinine to 1.9. The Captopril was
discontinued and the creatinine returned again to 1.3. Although
the chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , the
patient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she had
excellent oxygenation on room air. Of note the patient was not
restarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the
90-100 range. The patient was , however , started on her prednisone
at 5 milligrams p.o. q.d. as well as on her Synthroid. Chest tubes
and invasive monitoring were discontinued early in the patient&apos;s
hospital course and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. The patient was followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy for progression of her
mobility. She was determined to benefit from intensive
rehabilitation at a facility.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was ambulating with
assistance. She was tolerating a regular
diet. She was seen to be in atrial fibrillation but ventricular
response was well controlled in the 60s to 70s. Of note , her
electrocardiogram demonstrated persistent right bundle branch block
as well as a left anterior fascicular block. Although the patient
had been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INR
had not reached the therapeutic range. She was , however ,
therapeutic on heparin.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to a facility for
intensive conditioning and rehabilitation. There she
will continue to receive her heparin until she is therapeutic on
her Coumadin. Coumadin dosing will be handled by primary care
doctor , Dr. Corey Updegraff , or a physician at the rehabilitation
center. Dr. Turks &apos;s number is 250-940-9571. The goal INR is 2
to 2.5. The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays as
prior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions which were small and were not compromising her
respiration at all.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.
q.d.; Colace 100 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. while taking Tylenol #3;
Lasix 80 milligrams p.o. q.d. to be continued initially but may be
discontinued at the discretion of the primary care or cardiology
physicians , pending the resolution of the pleural effusions and her
respiratory status; Synthroid 150 micrograms p.o. q.d. The patient
will require thyroid function tests in four weeks. Multivitamin
one tablet p.o. q.d.; Coumadin , dose to be determined by the
patient&apos;s INR , again the goal is 2 to 2.5. The patient received 4
milligrams on September , and 3 milligrams on September , and her
INR on September is 1.3. Axid 150 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; K-Dur
10 mEq p.o. q.d. , potassium will also need to be monitored while
she is on the Lasix; intravenous heparin 800 units per hour with a
PTT goal of 50-60. The patient&apos;s PTT today on this dosing is 54.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with Dr. Kale in four to
six weeks , with Dr. Nicklas in two weeks , and with Dr.
Etheredge in one to two weeks.

Discharge Date: 3/14/2004
ATTENDING: SID GIL KIJOWSKI MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , the patient is a
76-year-old woman with coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 who was recently admitted
with non ST elevation MI/congestive heart failure at which time
catheterization revealed an increased wedge with decreased
patency in both venous grafts and a patent LIMA graft with
collaterals. The patient has an extensive past medical history
of hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulin
dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multiple
MI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout ,
schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism.
At her baseline she has been staying at the Wrangcon Ronhomar Memorial Hospital and on
admission was complaining of chest pressure since waking , similar
to the pressure she felt during a prior admission. She had a
certain amount of shortness of breath , some nausea , two episodes
of vomiting and her symptoms were not responsive to nitroglycerin
tablets at the Harpa Vensports Center The patient came to the Ter Health Emergency Department where she reported that her
chest pressure had resolved. She was treated with IV TNG. In
the Emergency Department she was also treated with Lopressor ,
aspirin , IV trinitroglycerin and was heparinized. The patient
then pulled out the lines. Her admission vitals were significant
for a blood pressure of 180/90. The patient had a heart rate of
86 , was afebrile and was breathing at 100% at 2 liters. She had
an elevated JVP , had clear sounding lungs , trace edema and at the
left upper sternal border and left lower sternal border a
systolic ejection murmur II-III/VI was heard with S1 and S2.
Admission labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of
2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient had elevated
platelets from a baseline of 30 to 80 to 673 on admission , a
white count of 9.3 , hematocrit of 35. EKG was notable for a Q3
which had been seen on a prior EKG. T-wave inversions also seen
on a prior EKG. The patient had an echo on 7/4 which showed
concentric LVH with an EF of 30-35% , posterolateral and inferior
akinesis was also seen. A calcified aortic valve with trace AI
and mild MR was seen. On 10/19 , the patient had catheterization
which showed that her circulation was right dominant with an LAD
90% and 100% lesions , left circumflex with 100% lesion , RCA with
100% lesions. She had an SVG to PDA graft with 100% lesion , SVG
to circumflex graft with 85% lesion stented to 10% at that time.
She had a LIMA to LAD graft which was patent , and she had lots of
collaterals. The right heart cath was significant for a wedge of
39 and a PA of 75/34 and right atrial pressure of 14 and a
cardiac index of 1.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system ,
1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin ,
beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out with
enzymes. On the first day of hospitalizations , the patient&apos;s
heparin was stopped , the patient&apos;s IV trinitroglycerin was
stopped as well. The patient was started on nadolol and that
dose was increased to 80 q.day which the patient tolerated well
and seemed to control the patient&apos;s blood pressure and heart rate
reasonably well. The patient&apos;s attending felt that the patient
was a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventions
and would not benefit significantly from it. The symptoms the
patient was having was similar she was having during a prior
hospitalization which had ended just two days before this
admission. It was felt that her nausea , vomiting and chest
pressure were probably noncardiac in nature. The only change in
the patient&apos;s cardiac medications at the time of discharge is an
increase in nadolol to 80 mg q.day.
Rhythm: The patient&apos;s rhythm was monitored on telemetry for most
of her stay during this hospitalization. Significant events were
not observed.
Pump: The patient was continued at her regular dose of
outpatient medications which seemed to be effective. The patient
had multiple complaints of chest pain/pressure during her
hospitalization which resulted in periodic examinations and EKGs.
All of these workups were negative.
2. GI: On 10/26 it was noted that the patient had an increased
white count of 16 , 000. Also on exam on that day it was noted
that the patient had marked right upper quadrant abdominal
tenderness and fullness. She was not tender anywhere else in her
abdomen. Abdominal exam was also significant for a central mass
representing an umbilical hernia. At that time , General Surgery
consult was called. Lipase and amylase were sent off. They were
negative. Liver function tests were also in the normal range at
that time. Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgical
candidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommend
a cholecystectomy in the future. They recommended initial
antibiotic course of amp , Levo and Flagyl which she was started
on. They also recommended making the patient NPO treated her
with Pepcid and giving her adequate IV hydration. The major
intervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube by
Interventional Radiology which was placed on the night of
3/16/04. On 9/24 , the patient&apos;s white count was down to 10 with
a Tmax of 100 , and at the time of discharge the patient had a
white count in the normal range around 7 and was also afebrile.
Surgery followed the patient during her stay in the hospital as
did Interventional Radiology. Bile was sent out for culture
which showed yeast as well as a gram stain which showed gram
positive cocci. The patient&apos;s antibiotics were switched to
Vancomycin , Levo and Flagyl. Initially the Vancomycin and Flagyl
were given IV and the Levo was given p.o. One day prior to
discharge , the patient&apos;s Flagyl was switched to p.o. and on the
day of discharge the Vancomycin was stopped after the patient had
received seven days of Vancomycin. The patient will be
discharged on Flagyl p.o. and Levo p.o. The patient was also
started no Fluconazole 100 to treat the yeast that was noted in
her bile cultures. The IR drain will need to be in the patient&apos;s
gallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient has
her elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a later
date.
3. ID: The patient is colonized with MRSA and appropriate
precautions were taken and the patient was also noted to have an
infection in her gallbladder and was treated for it as such.
4. Pain: The patient was treated for abdominal pain during her
stay in the hospital with Demerol and also with Morphine.
5. Psychiatry: The patient was seen by Psychiatry on admission
to help manage her agitation and delirium. They did a
preliminary assessment of the patient. The patient did show
certain signs of agitation and multiple code grays had to be
called on the patient for difficult behavior , though the patient
was never in danger of truly hurting herself or others.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac chest pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis now resolved.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: ASA 325 , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 80
b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Levoxyl 175 , nadolol 80 , Lipitor
80 q.h.s. , Lantis 18 units , Diovan 80 , levofloxacin 500 every 24
hours to complete a 14 day course , Fluconazole 100 to complete a
14 day course , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. to complete a 14 day course ,
Plavix 75 , famotidine 20 b.i.d. , iron 325 q.day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Brunckhorst is a 70 year old man who
recently had been experiencing an
increase in frequency of chest pain with exertion. As a result of
his recent increase in symptoms , he was administered an exercise
tolerance test which was predictive of ischemia and revealed an
ejection fraction of approximately 50%. As a result of his
positive exercise tolerance test , he was referred for cardiac
catheterization on May , 1998 which revealed three vessel
coronary artery disease. At this time , he was referred to the
cardiac surgery service for revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for transitional cell
carcinoma of the bladder , the
patient was status post radical cystectomy in 1992 with an ileal
loop bypass , no chemotherapy or radiation therapy was used in the
treatment of this cancer , also significant history of asthma
treated at home with the use of inhalers , and patient also reported
a history of gallstones which were asymptomatic.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Cardizem 180 mg once a day , 81 mg of aspirin
a day , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once a day.
The patient used Beclovent metered dose inhaler at three puffs once
a day at home to control his asthma symptoms.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient reported a remote history of tobacco use
with no tobacco use for the last thirty years.
Likewise , he reported no current use of alcohol.
ALLERGIES: Patient reported no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , temperature was
98.4 degrees Fahrenheit , heart rate of 80
beats per minute and regular , blood pressure of 120/80 , and an
oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. HEENT: Essentially within
normal limits revealing no audible bruits over his carotid
arteries , no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy , and his
oropharynx was benign with reasonably good dentition. CARDIAC:
Examination revealed the heart to be in a regular rate and rhythm
at 80 beats per minute with no audible murmur , gallop , or rub.
CHEST: Examination revealed the lungs to be clear to auscultation
in bilateral lung fields. ABDOMEN: Examination was benign with
the exception of the ileal loop mentioned above. The abdomen was
otherwise nontender and nondistended without any focal findings.
EXTREMITIES: Examination revealed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema ,
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally , and no evidence of varicose
veins. RECTAL: Examination revealed normal tone and guaiac
negative stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Values at the time of admission included a
BUN of 17 , a creatinine of 1.1 , sodium of
140 , potassium of 4.3 , white blood cell count of 9 , platelet count
of 245 , 000 , and a hematocrit of 49.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was taken to the Operating Room on January , 1998 where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times four including left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts
to the posterior descending coronary artery , the obtuse marginal ,
and the PLV. For further details of this operation , please refer
to the dictated Operative Note. Patient progressed well in his
postoperative course. He was extubated on postoperative day number
one and transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Stepdown
Unit on postoperative day number two. On postoperative day number
three , the patient had a his chest tubes and temporary cardiac
pacing wires discontinued and began working on increasing his
ambulation and mobility. Patient continued to progress well on the
Stepdown Unit and was now in good condition for discharge to home
with visiting nurse services on postoperative day number six. The
only complication of note during his postoperative course was
positive urine culture for which the patient was started on
levofloxacin to be continued for a total course of seven days.
DISPOSITION: The patient is in good condition for discharge to
home on postoperative day number six.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Beclovent three puffs inhaled once a day ,
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Niferex 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and levofloxacin 500 mg
p.o. q.d. times four days.
FOLLOW-UP: He has been instructed to make follow-up appointments
with his cardiologist for one week following discharge
and to return to see his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Bennie Bement , six
weeks following discharge from the hospital.

Discharge Date: 10/22/2001
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RECURRENT PLEURAL EFFUSIONS AND SHORTNESS OF
BREATH FROM YELLOW NAIL SYNDROME.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.
3. ANXIETY.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Cabaniss is a 70-year-old woman with
a history of yellow nail syndrome ,
hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,
who has had multiple admissions since October 2001. The first was
an admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01.
At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was
diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial
effusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained
from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. She
was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart
failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission was
from 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Aen Medical Center . At that time , she had
increased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during that
admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large
pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.
A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right
atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of
38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure
was 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease or
restrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in her
pleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP were
negative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or
hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.
The third admission was at Beysa Dward Hospital from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , for
increasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity
edema. At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.
She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudative
effusions. PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of
1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 ,
40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. She
was ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission.
She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,
consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,
lymphedema and yellow fingernails. She was started on high dose
Vitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis.
However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose of
diuretics.
Since her discharge in July , she has been aggressively diuresed ,
but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. In September
2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and was
restarted on Lasix. Over the week prior to admission , she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion. She has baseline shortness of
breath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. Her
weight at discharge in July was 208 , and on admission she
currently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior to
admission. She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough with
white sputum. She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharp
with dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.
She also has increasing lower extremity edema. In the emergency
department , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,
respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2
liters. She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs without
improvement and Lasix 160 mg IV with a 600 cc diuresis.

SUMMARY: This is a 70-year-old woman with history of hypertension ,
diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , home 02
requirement and yellow nail syndrome. She was admitted with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over
the past week prior to admission. She has most likely had a
failure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tapped
along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in
terms of recurrent pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. We initially diuresed Ms. Jowell
with IV Lasix , along with Diuril. She had brisk
diuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. On
hospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and were
able to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. The fluid was
sent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as an
exudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. The cytology was
negative for any malignant cells. The pulmonary team was
consulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to
prevent effusions from recurring. We consulted thoracic surgery ,
who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungs
for evidence of malignancy.
CT scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having to
do the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right and
left lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have been
malignancies. CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance before
any definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. We obtained a
stress MIBI. On 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgery
of the right chest. At that time , Dr. Women , the cardiothoracic
surgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedly
thickened and yellow. She also took a wedge biopsy of the right
lower lobe. Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mild
nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.
The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoid
tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. She had a chest tube placed
at the time of operation and tolerated that well. However , after that
procedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and was
admitted to MICU overnight. She extubated without problems and
remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen
saturations in the 90%. She was readmitted to the medicine team
on the following day , 8/28/01. Overall , she tolerated that
procedure well. Her chest tube that was placed on the right side
did not drain much fluid over the next few days. However , the
pleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we did
a thoracentesis on 8/28/01. We removed 1 liter of turbid ,
yellowish brown fluid. The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte and
macrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at this
time. As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic
surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has
shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient&apos;s 70% of
the time. The pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. She tolerated this
procedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48
hours. The chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.
Mrs. Musson &apos;s shortness of breath was much improved after the
initial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on her
home oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. The
plan is for her to see Dr. Colasante in 2 weeks and also have a
follow-up chest x-ray. At that time , Dr. Ostermann will determine if
there is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.
She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial
pleurodesis on the left.
2. Cardiovascular. Mrs. Blan was tachycardic on admission , and
continued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. She was
initially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably over
diuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.
On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates in
the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. She converted back to
normal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers and
a Diltiazem drip. She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg PO
b.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinus
rhythm. However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HL
tachycardia during her MICU admission. At the time of admission ,
we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. She had a bedside
echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a
trace pericardial effusion. She also had a dobutamine MIBI for
cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. Her
heart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreased
from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. The clinical response to
dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was
normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. There
were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or
rest images. However , only planer images could be obtained , due to
difficulty with positioning of the patient&apos;s left arm. Her results
were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of
hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically
limited.
In terms of her diuresis , Ms. Duensing was kept on IV Lasix for only
the first few days of her admission , and then was switched to PO
diuretics. Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and then
decreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. Her lower extremity edema decreased
significantly , along with her pleural effusions.
3. Renal. Ms. Handy &apos;s baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatinine
throughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. We caused a mild
contraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete her
electrolytes as needed. She will follow with Dr. Svinth for her
renal insufficiency as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine. Ms. Reppell has type II diabetes and was on glyburide
5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. She continued that therapy as an
inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this
admission.
5. Rheumatology. Ms. Chad has a history of gout , and we were
concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive
diuresis. We continued her colchicine and decreased her
allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. We also continued her Vitamin E
therapy for the yellow nail syndrome.
6. Hematology. She has chronic anemia , and we continued her iron
and Procrit treatment during the admission.
DISPOSITION: Ms. Souza will be discharged to home with VNA
services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical
therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in
her joints infected with gout. She has been instructed to make
follow-up appointments with Dr. Amicone in a few weeks , and to have
a chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. Burchell She should also
follow-up with Dr. Donkin in the renal clinic.

regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2. She had 2/6 holosystolic ejection
murmur that was heard at the left sternal border. Her neck , she
had no carotid bruits , no jugular venous pressure. Pulses were
bilaterally symmetric in the carotid arteries. Her lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Extremities were warm and well
perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurologically , she was
intact. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact grossly. She was alert

pressure of 40 mmHG from lying down to standing position multiple
times during this admission. This seemed to be exacerbated by
dialysis. In dialysis , her dry weight was increased and her blood
pressure medications were discontinued completely. She was seen by

likely an autonomic neuropathy causing orthostatic symptoms and
hypotension. There were no complications to her medical stay.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Rheumatoid arthritis , myocardial infarction ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease
status post carotid endarterectomy , status post cerebrovascular
accident , gastroesophageal reflux disease , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral artery aneurysm , and depression.
The patient is a 77-year-old female with coronary artery disease
who presented to an outside hospital with chest pain that she
thought was GERD but became concerned when it started radiating
down her left arm. At the outside hospital , she was noted to be
febrile with temperature 39.8 and noted on EKG to have ST
elevations in the inferior leads. The patient was med-flighted
to Hasey Health Care for an emergent cath. The patient had 70%
LAD lesion , 50% proximal RCA , and 90% mid RCA lesion that was
stented to 0% , and a 60% PDA lesion , and LVEDP of 33 on initial
cath. Started on Integrilin post cath and transferred to CCU.
The patient did well in the CCU and was transferred out on the
next day. Previous to admission , the patient resided in a
assisted living facility and was fairly active but has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion , decreasing exercise tolerance
over the past six months.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature was 98.8 , heart
rate was in the 70s , BP was 120s/60s , respirations was 22 ,
saturation was 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Generally , she is
an obese female in mild distress. Some cough. Her HEENT exam
showed a clear oropharynx. No erythema or injection. Skin had
no rashes or other lesions. Neck was supple with full range of
motion. JVP was approximately 2 with 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. No thyromegaly or nodules. Chest was noted to have
diffuse wheezing with bilateral bibasilar crackles. Questionable
right-sided consolidation , PMI nondisplaced with a regular rate
and rhythm with S4 , S1 with physiologically split S2. No
significant murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was nondistended and
nontender. Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Her
extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 2+ femoral ,
DP , and PT pulses. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented
with normal mental status and nonfocal exam. Her chest x-ray
showed evidence of pulmonary edema with focal consolidation of
right upper lobe with chest consistent with pneumonia. Her EKG
on admission , was normal sinus rhythm in the 60s with normal axis
and inferior Q waves with T-wave inversions inferiorly and
laterally.
IMPRESSION: This is a 77-year-old female status post IMI with
concurrent COPD exacerbation secondary to probable right upper
lobe pneumonia.
HOSPIATL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient did very well status post
revascularization. She did have some persistent pain while in
the intensive care unit and this went away on transfer to the
floor. She was medically optimized and continued on aspirin and
Plavix , added a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to the patient&apos;s
1B pump. The patient had compensated heart function on
discharge , euvolemic , but she did require intermittent Lasix.
She was discharged on Lasix to treat heart failure. Rhythm-wise ,
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the course
of hospitalization.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
with a rapid prednisone taper , and her home nebulizers , and a
10-day course of levofloxacin. Incidentally , the patient also
admitted to having a TB exposure. We placed a TB and that was
nonreactive and had induced sputums that were negative x 3.
3. Renal: The patient had well preserved renal function
normalized at discharge.
4. FEN: The patient was tolerating oral diet well and was
indicated on her instructions that she should have low-calorie ,
low-fat , low-cholesterol diet particularly given her diabetes and
she should watch her sugar and was maintained on her own.
5. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of depression and
noted to be depressed throughout the course of hospitalization
with some suicidal ideations toward the end of her
hospitalization. For that reason , we requested that psychiatry
come and evaluate her. They did so deeming her safe to return to
her facility and adjusting her antidepressants. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.
Procedures included percutaneous coronary intervention with
stenting to her right coronary artery x 2. Please see full
report for details.

twenty years ago. More recently , superficial bladder cancer which
was treated with partial resection. He developed hematuria
approximately April 1995. A workup revealed hemorrhagic cystitis
which was felt to be secondary to prior radiation treatments. He
has required approximately 1 unit of red cells per week for the
past three months to keep up with ongoing urologic blood loss.
The patient has no known cardiac history. His risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension , tobacco use , and male sex. No history of
hypercholesterolemia or family history. He describes 4-5 episodes
of chest tightness occurring over the past five years , the last
episode occurring approximately three months ago. He does note
progressive pedal edema over the past six weeks and over the past
two to three days has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion. On the day prior to admission , routine VNA blood draw
revealed a hematocrit of 17. His primary care physician was
notified and the patient was instructed to report to Fiville Gadelp Medical Center on the day of admission for transfusion. Repeat
hematocrit on the day of admission was 18. He received two units
of packed red cells and chemotherapy infusion and shortly after
transfusion developed shortness of breath without chest pain.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. His
initial CK was 770 with 70 MB fraction. The patient was
transferred to the Emergency Room for further evaluation where he
was treated with topical Nitro paste , 40 mg of IV Lasix , resulting
in 1500 cc of urine output. Aspirin and heparin were held
secondary to hemorrhagic cystitis. Beta blocker was also held
secondary to question of bronchospasm.
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
further treatment.

3. Neuropathy. 4. Prostate cancer. 5.
Bladder cancer in 1995 and 1990. 6. Status post appendectomy. 7.
History of TIAs three to four years ago. Workup revealed 50%
bilateral carotid stenosis. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes edema. Steroids cause cytosis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cardizem CD
180 mg p.o. q.day , folate 1 mg p.o. q.day ,
iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of leukemia. Father had a CVA and
kidney problems. No known coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Two pack per day smoking , 1-2 drinks per day. The
patient is a retired teacher at a Tyfranxingcolnlu Sxingscond A He currently lives alone and is single.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant older gentleman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 98.6 , blood
pressure 110/62 , heart rate 98. Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2
liters. HEENT: Examination is benign , no JVD , JVP was at 7 cm ,
neck was supple. CHEST: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIAC: 2+
carotids , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Two frontal scars , liver was palpable 2 cm
below the right costal margin. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , no masses. BACK: No CVA or
spinal tenderness. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ left greater than right pedal edema. Superficial
ulcers on bilateral soles. NEURO: Alert and oriented times three.
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 132 , potassium 4.7 , chloride
96 , bicarb 25 , BUN 7 , creatinine
0.9 , glucose 186 , CK of 776 , MB 70.5. LFTs were within normal
limits. Hematocrit was 28.3 , white count 10.4 , platelet count 283 ,
PT 13.5 , PTT 26.2 , normal differential.
Urinalysis grossly bloody , 10-20 white cells.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with small bilateral
effusions , right greater than left , plus Kerley B-lines.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90 , intervals 212/72/368 , and axis 7
degrees. No ischemic changes.
ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: This is a 69 year old gentleman with multiple
cardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondary
to severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who was
admitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion and
positive CK , MB. No definitive EKG changes and no clear history of
angina but recent history of increased pedal edema. The patient
likely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heart
failure in the setting of transfusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit
for further care. As mentioned above , heparin
and aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worsening
hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient received further blood
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. He remained
in the Cardiac Care Unit overnight. Serial CKs revealed an A set
of 776 ( MB 70.5 ) , B set 747 ( MB 54.7 ) , C set 564 ( MB 33.2 ). CTNI
was 25.1. EKG&apos;s were without evolution. The patient was therefore
ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram
was performed on 4/17/96 which showed normal LV function , mild LVH ,
no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimal
quality. The patient received a total of four units of red blood
cells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by the
first hospital day and received initially 40 mg of IV Lasix in the
Emergency Room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urine
output.
The patient was transferred from the CCU to General Medical
Service , Scogard on his second hospital day , 9/23/96. His post MI
course was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the first
hospital day. The patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrent
evidence of congestive heart failure.
He underwent a routine post MI submax ETT on 9/3/96. The patient
went 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peak
heart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. He stopped
secondary to fatigue. He occasional PVC&apos;s but no chest pain and no
ST changes. The test was thought to show no evidence of ischemia
but had a low work load. It was thought appropriate to discharge
the patient to home for further medical management and further
urologic workup as an outpatient. The most important medical
intervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 with
vigilant monitoring. During this admission , the patient received a
total of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of
30.9 on discharge.
From a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by Urology
during his hospitalization , who felt that his condition was
secondary to radiation cystitis. Given that he was now having
hematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgery
i.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely be
necessary in the near future. He will continue to follow-up with
Urology as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folic
acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n. chest pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition and will follow-up with Dr. Arthur Matney and also with Dr. Silos as well as Urology.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ON ADMISSION:
Emmitt Marc Guier , M.D.
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ON DISCHARGE:
Marco Mccaster , M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Mr. Gramby is a 43-year-old man with morbid obesity , type II
diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , chronic renal
insufficiency , and severe peripheral arterial disease status post
femoral popliteal bypass in September which was complicated by repeated
return of cellulitis x 2 who was admitted with cellulitis and
volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient has had two wound complications after his femoral
popliteal bypass requiring two separate incisions and drainages
including courses of intravenous nafcillin x 4 weeks and with
vancomycin x 4 weeks. He had been seen by Vascular Surgery five
days prior to admission and had been started on dicloxacillin for
a third episode of cellulitis. He had also presented with fluid
overload and spironolactone was added to his diuretic regimen.
His primary care provider saw him the day prior to admission , and
the patient reported a recent fall and the primary care physician
recommended admission to the hospital. The patient does report
some fever and shaking chills and decreased appetite. Also ,
reported weakness in bilateral lower extremities and right foot
pain. He has chronic loss of sensation in both feet.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Morbid obesity , type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of 2-2.5 , dyslipidemia , hypertension ,
coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , anemia ,
history of deep vein thrombosis , obstructive sleep apnea , anger
disorder , peptic ulcer disease , and tinea pedis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol 100 mg q.d. , spironolactone , torsemide 160 mg b.i.d. ,
Hyzaar 50/12.5 q. day , lisinopril 60 mg q. day , Neurontin 1200 mg
t.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Coumadin 8 mg ,
aspirin , Humalog sliding scale , Percocet , Pletal 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Procrit , Zantac , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and NPH 80 q.a.m. and
q.p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On physical exam , the patient was afebrile and had a temperature
of 99 , a heart rate of 70 , blood pressure 200/79 possibly taken
with an undersized cuff , 18 and 99% on room air. He is obese and
comfortable man in bed and in no acute distress. His JVP could
not be assessed from the size of his neck. Heart sounds were
distant. Chest was clear. His abdomen is obese with bowel
sounds , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: Notable for 3+
edema , and including 1+ extending to the groin. His pulses were
Dopplerable bilaterally with a triphasic wave on the right and
biphasic on the left. The medial aspect of his right leg had a
surgical scar. A healed annular burn wound in the medial knee
and an area of erythema along the scar with warmth , moderate
tenderness , no fluctuance and minimal induration , no discharge.
The diameter of his right leg was greater than his left. His
right heel had an intact ??blough?? and his left heel had a dry
pressure sore. His right big toe was tender to palpation.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Labs were notable for a creatinine of 3.4 and an INR of 7.1. His
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
Problem #1. Infectious Disease: The patient was started on
vancomycin IV on admission for his right medial thigh cellulitis
at the site of the femoropopliteal bypass with rapid
defervescence and improvement. No drainage , no fluctuance.
Additional antibiotic coverage was added specifically of
fluoroquinolone for anti-psuedomonal coverage for his diabetic
foot ulcers. The right heel also looked increasingly purulent
during his hospitalization and bilateral foot plain films were
done. These were negative for osteomyelitis but showed a metal
sliver in the right foot and an acute fracture of the first
metatarsal. Surgical debridement was done in the operating room
with drainage of pus , but the metal showed could not be located
even with fluoroscopy. The patient will complete a 14-day course
of levofloxacin and clindamycin for these foot ulcers , and will
be discharged home with visiting nursing care for b.i.d.
wet-to-dry dressing changes. He will follow up with Jerold Cristopher Blazon , M.D. in one to two weeks.
Problem #2. Renal: The patient was volume overloaded on
admission. His torsemide was changed to IV and metolazone was
added and was given 30 minutes prior to his first torsemide dose
of the day. A diuresis of 1.5-2 liters a day was achieved with
this regimen with the exception of a 4 liter diuresis overnight
on the first day of admission. His electrolytes were replaced as
needed. I have expected his creatinine increase to 4.5 by
discharge. He will need close renal follow ups as he may be
approaching need for dialysis. The Renal Service followed him
during this hospitalization and at their recommendation ,
spironolactone will be discontinued upon discharge since his
diuresis will be slowed.
Problem #3. Vascular: Diuresis was essential for resolution of
his cellulitis. Pletal was continued and because of his severe
peripheral arterial disease , he will require excellent wound care
to optimize healing.
Problem #4. Heme: Initially , his Coumadin was held for a
supratherapeutic INR. This was restarted when his INR was 2.2
and he his now in the therapeutic range and will need to be
followed.
Problem #5. Cardiovascular: He was hypertensive on arrival
which was treated with Hydralazine initially and transitioned to
his p.o. home medicines. Even with a large cuff , his blood
pressure continued to run high in the 150s-180s. On hospital day
#9 , Hydralazine p.o. was added with good effect which lowered his
systolic blood pressure to the range of the 120s-130s. Goal is
below 130/80.
Problem #6. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with NPH and
Humalog. The Diabetes Service saw the patient and at their
recommendation NPH doses were increased , and he is now on 90
units in the morning and 85 units at night. The goal for this
patient is below 150 particularly given the need for wound
healing.
Problem #7: GI: The patient was seen by Nutrition and will be
evaluated as an outpatient by Bariatric Surgery pending next
week. This is of utmost importance for this patient with
life-threatening morbid obesity who already has severe
complications of obesity-related conditions. The patient has
obesity , hyperventilation syndrome.
Problem #8. Pulmonary: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea.
A CPAP machine was brought to the patient bedside , but the
patient was unable to tolerate the nose mask. He will use his
own device when he returns home.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
He will go home with visiting nurse care and will need to see his
nephrologist , vascular surgeons , primary care provider , and
Bariatric Surgery following discharge.

SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologically: Intact.
Cardiovascular: On aspirin , has pacemaker for sick sinus.
Battery is low , cannot pace above 65 beats per minute with plans
to exchange generator. Pressure is better , paced externally at
90 BPM.
Respiratory: Saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen delivered by
nasal cannula so was moderate chest tube output.
Diet: Advanced as tolerated.
Renal: Postop increase in creatinine requiring dopamine ,
creatinine now down to 1.5. P.o. Lasix started.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with aspirin.
ID: Antibiotics are off. Afebrile.
Elevated white count secondary to myelofibrosis. Transferred to
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #6. Postop day #7 , 9/19/05 ,
last remaining chest tube removed. Patient still complains of
shortness of breath , saturating well on room air. Chest x-ray
looked slightly wet but nothing significant noted. Echo showed
moderate TR. No changes from prior echos. Send troponin , BNP to
help rule out PE per cards , very slow to ambulate , needs PT ,
probably rehab , is being paced to 70 BPM with external V wire ,
has internal pacer working at 60 beats per minute but needs
battery change by EPS.

fingers and toes. If color on extremities does not improve on
argatroban , will get vascular to see. So far color in right hand
looks better. Left fingers and toes bilaterally , no worse , no
better. Respiratory status worsens , consider CT angiogram with
contrast to rule out PE with Mucomyst given creatinine of 2.1.

Discharge Date: 5/17/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
STATUS POST MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 45 year old
gentleman with a history of a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in 23 of September He was also recently
involved in a motor vehicle accident , and has had left pressure
since the accident. His cardiac history began in 26 of September , when he
suffered a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac
catheterization at that time revealed a 90% proximal left anterior
descending lesion with anterolateral akinesis , which was treated
with angioplasty. He had a limited stress test on 18 of July , which
was limited by symptoms of chest pressure. The electrocardiogram
and thallium done at that time were both unrevealing. The patient
was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July , and then again
in January , 1991. He suffered multiple contusions , but no fractures.
Subsequent to the accidents , however , he described having left
flank and left side pain , which was exacerbated by movement and was
associated with the development of his left substernal chest
pressure. Nitroglycerin did seem to provide him some relief. The
patient was seen recently at Laclare&apos;s Bouldwalt in Rockoxsiford Au for chest
discomfort , and electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes did not show
any evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient has continued
to complain of chest discomfort over the past month , but all
electrocardiograms have been negative. An exercise tolerance test
was performed at Tygib Haysbonne Valley Hospital , which was positive for
chest discomfort and for ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.
Thallium examination was not performed because of infiltration of
the intravenous access. He was transferred from Jacklip on 22 of November , for further work-up and possible cardiac
catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a well
nourished , well appearing young black male.
His blood pressure was 130/80 , pulse 55 , respiratory rate 12. Lungs
were clear. Cardiac examination revealed S1 , S2 , with an S4
present , the jugular venous pressure was 5. The patient had 2+
carotid upstrokes without bruits. The abdomen was soft , good bowel
sounds , with left-sided tenderness and left flank tenderness to
palpation. Extremities showed no edema and good distal pulses.
Neurologic examination showed cranial nerves intact , motor
examination showed some decreased power on the left , but this was
thought secondary to pain. Sensory examination was normal , and his
plantar reflexes were downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , potassium was 4.6 ,
creatinine 1.3 , ALT 155 , AST 80 , LDH 228 ,
creatinine kinase 79 , cholesterol 212 , triglyceride 316 , white
blood count 6.1 , hematocrit 39 , prothrombin time 13.5 , partial
thromboplastin time 89.4. Admission chest x-ray showed no
abnormalities. Admission electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 56 beats per minute with some inverted T-waves in leads
II , III , F , and V2 through V4. The inverted T-wave in lead II
appeared to be new from a transfer electrocardiogram.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 22 of November , and was seen
by the Dental Service for his atypical pain
radiating to the neck. His cardiac risk factors included a
positive family history and a smoking history of less than 1 pack
per day. He had no history of diabetes or previous hypertension.
The patient continued to have chest pain , which responded only to
morphine. He underwent cardiac catheterization on 30 of April , which
revealed a right dominant circulation , kinking of the proximal left
anterior descending artery with a 70% stenosis. The patient
tolerated the cardiac catheterization well without hematoma or
bruit in the right groin. The patient continued to have episodes
of chest pain with 5/10 left-sided sternal chest pain without clear
electrocardiogram changes from the admission electrocardiogram. He
underwent an exercise tolerance test which showed he had 4/10 chest
pain prior to beginning the exercise tolerance test , but then got
worsening chest pain during the test after 8 minutes and 15
seconds , peak heart rate 160 , blood pressure 166/40. He did
develop 1 millimeter of downsloping ST depressions in the lateral
leads , and a pseudonormalization of the T-waves. The results were
discussed with the patient and the options were discussed , that is
medical management versus a repeat angioplasty or possible surgery.
The patient preferred medical management and wanted to be at home
to see if increased medical management would stabilize his chest
pain. The patient was discharged on 9 of September
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. He was to have
close FOLLOW-UP and management of his cardiac disease
with the Cardiology Group. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included
Motrin 600 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , diltiazem 90
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , Lopressor 50 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , Pepcid 20
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as
needed for pain , and Halcion 0.25 milligrams by mouth at hour of
sleep. The patient had a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Capetl in
Ing

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Clotted AV fistula , atrial fibrillation ,
and change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Donalson is a 61-year-old female
with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post
cardiac transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary
artery disease , rejection x2 , post transplant MVR and TVR , also
with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension and a subacute change in her mental status over the
last few months that presented with a clot in her right upper
extremity AV fistula. Her last hemodialysis session was two days
prior to admission , and she is usually dialyzed on Mondays ,
Wednesdays and Fridays. Interventional radiology did not perform
a thrombectomy of the right upper extremity fistula clot , as the
patient&apos;s systolic blood pressures were in the 90s , and they were
concerned about the patient&apos;s change in mental status as she
would need conscious sedation for the procedure. She was also
noted upon admission to have an EKG that displayed an atrial
tachyarrhythmia with 2:1 block that was presumed to be atrial
flutter. Her heart rate was noted to be in the 110s to 120s , and
the rest of her vital signs were stable. The patient denied any
chest pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or
palpitations. It should be noted however that the patient was
not entirely conversant. After speaking with the patient&apos;s son ,
more information was obtained about this patient&apos;s subacute
change in her mental status. The patient was admitted in July
of 2004 for a fall and femur fracture. During that admission ,
the son stated that the patient had an acute change in her mental
status such that she did not know who she was or where she was.
She was not answering questions appropriately. This was
persistent during that hospital stay and was of unclear etiology.
Prior to that admission , the patient is at baseline oriented to
person , place and time , and she is also very conversant. The son
does admit that the patient occasionally becomes confused about
the day of the week. Upon discharge from that admission , the
patient was sent to the Adtute Hospital for rehabilitation. The
son says that over the last few months , she has become slightly
better but definitely not at her baseline. He states that she is
often disoriented to person and place , although she does answer
some questions appropriately. The day prior to her admission ,
the patient&apos;s other son visit with her at the Meretcan Hospital Of County and
did not notice any change in her mental status since her
discharge. He has noted decreased p.o. intake over the last
month with the patient often refusing to eat. Upon questioning
the patient , she denies chest pain , abdominal pain , shortness of
breath , lightheadedness , and palpitations. Although , she does
answer yes and no to some questions , she is not very conversant
and does not volunteer any additional information.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy status post heart transplant in
1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery disease ,
post-transplant MVR and TVR , and transplant rejection x2.
2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ( Monday , Wednesday ,
Friday hemodialysis ).
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hypertension.
5. Peptic ulcer disease.
6. History of right frontal CVA.
7. Recurrent falls of unclear etiology with a Reveal monitor
implanted.
8. Asthma.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Labetalol 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o.
q.day , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.day , insulin NPH 20 units subcu
q.a.m. , Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.day , Nexium 40 mg p.o.

rapamycin 8 mg p.o. q.day , sevelamer 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor
20 mg p.o. q.day , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day.
ALLERGIES: Percocet.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.3 , pulse 110 , blood
pressure 90/60 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 96% on
room air. In general , the patient appears slightly cachetic and
is in no acute distress. She is awake and is occasionally
responding to questions but is otherwise not very conversant.
She is oriented to place. Her head and neck exam is
unremarkable. Her cardiovascular exam is notable for regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no gallops , 2/6 systolic
murmur at the apex. Her JVP was noted to be 8 cm. Her lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally on a limited physical exam
( the patient is not inspiring deeply on request ). Her abdomen is
benign. Her extremities are warm with 1+ DP pulses. Her right
upper extremity graft is without thrill and without bruit.
LABORATORY DATA: Her laboratory values were notable for a BUN of
44 , creatinine 6.8 , calcium 11.2 , PTH 263 , white blood cells 6.7 ,
hematocrit 47.3 , and platelets 261.
EKG: Her EKG displayed a flutter with a 2:1 block. Her heart
rate was estimated to be at 110.
Studies: Ms. Sluyter had a noncontrast head CT that was notable
for widened ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. She was noted to
have extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter
changes. There was a focal lesion in the frontal lobe on the
right consistent with old infarct and unchanged from her CT scan
two months prior. There was no evidence for hemorrhage. In
general , there was no change in the CT scan when compared to her
CT scan from 5/17/04. The patient underwent a transthoracic
echocardiogram on 8/20/04. This TTE showed LV with a normal
size and moderate concentric LVH. Her LVEF was noted to be 55%.
There were no wall motion abnormalities. Her RV size and
function was grossly normal. Her mitral valve was noted to be
status post repair with a transmitral gradient of 4.0 mmHg.
There was trace MR. There was no change in this echocardiogram
when compared to her echocardiogram from 4/7/04. The patient
also underwent a lumbar puncture. Her CSF was notable for an
elevated protein. Her CSF had a normal glucose , two white blood
cells with lymphocyte predominance , gram stain that did not show
any organisms , and cultures that are no growth to date. On
cytology , there were no malignant cells seen in the CSF. Her
cryptococcal antigen was negative. CSF studies that are pending
include the following: CMV culture , HSV culture , VZV culture ,
Listeria culture , HSV PCR , CMV PCR , HHV6 PCR , VZV PCR , and VDRL.
The cultures thus far have had no growth to date.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Abrams is a 61-year-old female with a
history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post cardiac
transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery
disease , post transplant MVR and TVR , and rejection , also with
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , hypertension and
diabetes mellitus who presented with a right upper extremity
fistula clot , new atrial flutter with 2:1 block and a change in
her mental status that has been of many months.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: The patient is status post cardiac transplant and has
been maintained on her outpatient immunosuppressive regimen.
This includes prednisone , rapamycin , and Imuran. She has
remained euvolemic during her hospital admission.
B. Ischemia: There were no active issues , and the patient was
maintained on her outpatient regimen of aspirin , statin and
Imdur.
C. Rhythm: Electrophysiology has been seeing the patient and
has recommended medical management for her atrial flutter/atrial
fibrillation with 2:1 block. The patient&apos;s heart rate ranged
from the 80s to 120s , and she was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o.
q.i.d. She seemed to respond well to the diltiazem , although it
was hard to measure a response since the patient often refused
her medications. The patient was also maintained on metoprolol
75 mg p.o. q.i.d. It was hoped that the addition of the
diltiazem to the metoprolol would allow for the rate control of
this patient&apos;s atrial arrhythmia.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed on
3/9/04 for temporary access for hemodialysis. She was dialyzed
while in the hospital and maintained on Nephrocaps. She is
scheduled on 11/28/04 for a right upper extremity venogram in
order to access her anatomy for the vascular surgeons to create
hemodialysis access.
3. Neurology/psychiatry: The patient&apos;s change in mental status
over the last few months is still of an unclear etiology. She
underwent an EEG that showed diffuse slowing that was consistent
with a toxic metabolic etiology. There was no seizure activity.
She underwent two CT scans of her head without contrast that were
negative for bleed. There were no changes in her CT scans when
compared to prior CT scan. She also underwent an LP with CSF as
mentioned above. An MRI was not completed as the patient has an
event monitor in her heart. The differential diagnosis for this
patient is changed and her mental status still includes
depression and pseudodementia , and we are still ruling out
infectious etiologies with the CSF studies that are pending at
the moment ( although this is unlikely ). It is hoped that she
will be able to follow up with neuropsychiatric testing in order
to further evaluate her change in mental status. It should be
noted that during her hospital stay , the patient&apos;s level of
interaction with the staff varied. There were days where she was
more conversant and would answer many questions appropriately.
There were also times when the patient refused to speak with
staff , appeared withdrawn and refused medications and treatments.
The son has noted that she was actually better in the hospital ,
appearing more conversant and interactive. It does not appear
that these periods of increased interaction with staff and family
were in any correlation with this patient&apos;s hemodialysis.
4. Endocrinology: The patient has type 2 diabetes on insulin at
home. She was maintained on a sliding scale of lispro with
fingersticks blood glucose before every meal and before sleeping.
Her blood sugars were in control and ranged between 110 to 240.
5. Infectious diseases: The patient has had a few low-grade
temperatures to the 100.0. An infectious workup did not yield
any etiology. She has not had an elevation in her white blood
cell count , although this may be a result of her
immunosuppression. Blood cultures from 7/10/04 yielded no
growth. Urine was not cultured , as the patient is anuric.
6. Feeding and electrolytes: The patient was hypercalcemic on
admission. This was attributed to vitamin D per the renal
fellow. Her calcium levels were followed and trended into the
normal range. She was fed a pureed and honey thick diet after
her speech and swallow evaluation indicated that the patient had
intact swallowing function.
7. GI: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease , and
she was given Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.day.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Imuran 50 mg
p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 5000 units
subcutaneously t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 40
mg p.o. q.day , Imdur sustained release 30 mg p.o. q.day ,
Nephrocaps one tablet q.day , sliding scale of lispro insulin ,
rapamycin 8 mg p.o. q.day , Cartia XT 240 mg p.o. q.day , and
Toprol XL 300 mg p.o. q.day.
The patient was discharged to a Rehabilitation Center in stable
condition. She is to follow up with vascular surgery for a new
access for hemodialysis. It is hoped that she will follow up
with neuropsychiatric testing in order to further evaluate her
subacute change in mental status. The patient has three sons
that are very involved in her care. One of her sons is named
Roderick Nead , and his phone number is 179-486-3367.

Discharge Date: 7/30/1992
DIAGNOSES: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT ON 26 of August
AORTIC DISSECTION.
NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF TOBACCO ABUSE IN THE PAST.
HEPATITIS-C ANTIBODY POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 51 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary
artery disease with myocardial infarction in 1977 , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1977 , and myocardial infarction
in 1985 , with redo coronary artery bypass grafting at Oua Medical Center , complicated by cardiogenic shock , treated with an
intra-aortic balloon pump in 1985. Since 24 of November , the patient
reported recurrent congestive heart failure with chest pain and a
variable bundle branch block requiring pacer placement with a DDD
pacer in 1990. He had an electrophysiologic study at the time ,
which was negative for ventricular tachycardia. In 1 of January , the
patient reported to Hobrook Medical Center with severe congestive heart
failure and was transferred to Mi Hospital after
treatment for transplant evaluation. At Tiesi Hospital Medical Center on 3 of March , the patient&apos;s work-up included an exercise
tolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogram
per minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentially
open left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts and
occluded native vessels. The right atrial pressure was 10 ,
pulmonary artery pressure 54/28/30 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 36 , cardiac output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440.
The echocardiogram revealed severely decreased ejection of around
15% with 2+ mitral regurgitation. Other issues included a positive
tobacco history in the past with a moderately decreased FEV-1 of
2.2 , and also hepatitis-C antibody positivity. The patient went
home after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever or
chills. He did have some constipation. For 2 days , he had some
increased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestive
heart failure. The patient was readmitted on the night prior to
transplantation on 9 of September , for increasing congestive heart
failure and Dobutamine treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as
stated above. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIAL
HISTORY revealed a 25-pack-year history of tobacco , none since
1977. He has 4 children , married. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION on
transfer included digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth each day , Pepcid
20 milligrams by mouth twice a day , captopril 25 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Lasix 80 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Ecotrin 1 by mouth each day , Coumadin , Dobutamine drip.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a somewhat cachectic male ,
comfortable with oxygen. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat examination was benign. Neck was supple without
adenopathy. Lungs were clear at the tops with bibasilar crackles.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for S1 , S2 and S3 , no S4 ,
murmur or rub. Abdominal examination was benign. Extremities
showed no edema. Rectal examination revealed guaiac negative
stool , no mass.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , laboratory
values were essentially normal , except for
hyperglycemia , mildly increased liver function tests and creatinine
1.1. On admission , blood urea nitrogen was 18 , creatinine .9 ,
glucose 176 , sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , prothrombin time 13.1 ,
partial thromboplastin time 29 , calcium 8.5 , albumin 3.7 , magnesium
2 , ALT 17 , alkaline phosphatase 155 , total bilirubin 1.1.
Urinalysis was negative. Hematocrit was 38.8 , platelets 199 , 000 ,
white blood cell count 8.3. The electrocardiogram revealed AV
pacing at 90. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a pacer with
the wires in the right ventricle. An echocardiogram obtained prior
to transplantation revealed right atrial pressure 10 , pulmonary
artery 54/28/38 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 36 , cardiac
output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440 , ejection fraction
15% , 2+ mitral regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
15 of November , and received an orthotopic heart
transplant. This was complicated by a descending aortic dissection
from the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoral
catheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypasses
and would not have tolerated aortic bypass. The patient did well
postoperatively and was placed on Cyclosporine-A and prednisone.
The patient was weaned off the ventilator and Dobutamine and
diuresed without difficulty. Of note , one of the two preoperative
blood cultures grew out Clostridium perfringens. Three subsequent
blood cultures were negative , however. An Infectious Disease
Service consultation was obtained , and it was felt that intravenous
penicillin for 10 to 14 days , 30 million units every 4 hours , would
be warranted given the patient&apos;s underlying immunosuppression. The
patient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to the
protocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies.
The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the
aortic dissection on 11 of February , and then follow-up on 10 of March These
revealed a type-B dissection from the left iliac to the subclavian.
The ascending aorta was not involved. There was flow in both the
true and false lumen on both tests. The renal , SMA and ciliac
arteries were all intact. An echocardiogram on 11 of February , revealed
good left ventricular function , a small amount of mitral
regurgitation , some increased pulmonary pressures and the
dissection of the aorta. The patient underwent abdominal
computerized tomography scan to rule out any occult source of
abscess which would be responsible for the Clostridium bacteremia ,
as recommended by the gastroenterology consultant. No such source
was found. The patient&apos;s blood pressure was initially controlled
with Nifedipine 3 times a day 30 milligrams , until the patient
reached the expected postoperative denervated tachycardia. After
this point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams by
mouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of the
dissection. The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service
from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service on 11 of February , and did well.
Adjustments were made in his Cyclosporine dose. He was initially
tried on some NPH insulin for hyperglycemia , but eventually with
the prednisone taper had good blood sugars on Glyburide 2.5
milligrams by mouth each day. The goal was set for the patient&apos;s
blood pressure to be kept at all times below 140 , and this was for
the most part achieved. The patient was anemic during admission ,
but postoperatively gradually his red blood cell count increased.
He was started on iron sulfate to assist in his hematologic
recovery. B12 and folate levels were normal despite polys on
stain. The patient&apos;s chest tube wounds were cultured during the
postoperative course and grew normal skin flora. They were packed
with wicks as necessary. The left groin lymph area drained clear
fluid and persisted , but had decreased substantially prior to
discharge. The patient was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service for
some features of hypomania on 17 of May They recommended Valium 5
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day to counter the steroid-induced
hypomania. Physical Therapy Service was active in the patient&apos;s
ambulation and felt comfortable that the patient would be able to
go home and manage on his own.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. COMPLICATIONS
included aortic dissection type B from left iliac to
left subclavian. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Cyclosporine-A 250
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Imuran 50 milligrams by mouth each
day , prednisone 25 milligrams by mouth each day , atenolol 75
milligrams by mouth each day , Glyburide 2.5 milligrams by mouth
each day , Nifedipine 30 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,
Septra-Double-Strength 1 by mouth every other day , Nystatin 15 cc
by mouth 4 times a day , iron sulfate 325 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Valium 2.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to follow a
low-saturated fat , low-cholesterol , no-added-salt diet. He will
advance his activity as tolerated. The patient was to have a
visiting nurse daily until he feels comfortable with his own care.
The visiting nurse will assist in wound dressing changes , taking
his finger sticks twice a day , taking his blood pressure and
notifying physicians for blood pressure greater than 140. They
were to check differential blood pressures between right and left
arms. The patient will also receive physical therapy assistance to
continue his progress in ambulation. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with the Cardiac Transplant Clinic on 28 of November , for routine
FOLLOW-UP.

HPI: 35 F with CKD IV/V ( renal: Nickolls ) 2/2 minimal change dz
was in USOH until 6 days PTA when developed bilateral foot pain
typical of gout flare. 5 days PTA developed SOB and heart racing
which was constant. Attributed sx to prednisone and stopped
prednisone 3 days PTA. Yet SOB and sensation of rapid heart rhythm
continued. She had never had the sensation before and has no h/o
tachyarrhythmia. On DOA , she came to ED for evalulation of her bilateral
gouty foot pain and was found to be tachycardic to 150 bpm. EKG notable
for narrow complex tachycardia ( SVT/likely AVNRT. )
. IN ED: given adenosine 6 mg IV x 1 with conversion to NSR for less
than a minutes , and then reversion back to SVT. She responded to
additional adenosine 12 mg IV x 1 and reverted to SR for the remainder of
her hospital stay.

pain 2/2 gout. Found to be in SVT with rate to 150 bpm. Initially ,
high suspicion of PE , given h/o PE , evolution of pleuritic chest pain ,
and SVT. LENI&apos;s were negative. She was empirically started on heparin
IV. Yet on HD2 , she had a V/Q scan with NO perfusion defect and heparin
was discontinued. The precipitating event leading to SVT was not
determined. No PE or evidence of ischemic event. However , she had
multiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( Ca 6.0 , iCa
0.79 , Mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease and
evolving cardiomyopathy. Her SVT resolved after adenosine 12 mg IV x 1
and she remained in SR during the rest of hospital stay. ECHO showed EF
40% , diastolic dysfunction and LVH likely 2/2 longstanding HTN. This
was a change from ECHO in 2002 when she had nl EF 60% , no e/o diastolic
dysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. The cause of her new
cardiomyopathy is possibly HTN and concern raised for high-output state
due increase flow thru AV fistula. We discussed the case briefly with
the vascular surg service. There is no definitive test to determine if
flow throught the aVF is too great. This may need to be discussed between
her primary renal doctors and vascular.
.
HYPOCALCEMIA: VitD level pending , PTH dramatically elevated at 914. Noted
to have elevated QTc of QTC 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. Calcitriol
was increased and calcium citrate was initiated. Calcium was also
repleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation.
Ionized calcium was followed. She is being discharged home on Calcium
citrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol.
.
CODE: FULL
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalized
after treatment with medicine. There is no clear explanation for why you
went into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. These
include disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , as
low as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluid
retention. You did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. You
were started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dose
was increased. Metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high blood
pressure.
.
KEY MEDICINE CHANGES:
1. Increase metoprolol dose
2. Increase calcitriol dose
3. Start calcium citrate: takes this medicine BETWEEN meals , as it will
be less effective if taken with meals.
4. It is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep your
heart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay in
acceptable limits. If you have problems filling your medicines , please
notifiy your primary or renal doctors.
.
Contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you develop
recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heart
rhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on with
breathing problems or chest pain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check metabolic panel , including calcium.
2. F/u on vitamin D level ( pending at d/c )
3. Check BP on elevated dose metoprolol ER

Discharge Date: 4/30/1996
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST CORONARY
ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT , RIGHT SIDED CAROTID
ENDARTERECTOMY , AND POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient was admitted March , 1996
with a history of one to two months of
stable exertional angina which became crescendo angina and an
exercise stress test , thallium , revealed multivessel disease.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery
bypass grafting on March ,
1996 , right carotid endarterectomy on March , 1996 , he had some
post-operative atrial fibrillation/flutter as above , he was status
post a myocardial infarction , he had a history of hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes times three years , and gout.
ALLERGIES: He had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Included an eight pack year tobacco history which
he quit approximately thirty years ago and he
drank alcohol socially.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease and
questionable for diabetes mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a well-developed , well-nourished
white man in no apparent distress. On
transfer to Medicine , his vital signs were a temperature of 98.8 ,
heart rate of 140 in atrial flutter , blood pressure 150/70 , and
breathing at 18 with a room air saturation of 94%. HEENT:
Examination showed his extraocular muscles intact , pupils equal ,
round , and reactive to light , his right carotid endarterectomy had
Steri-Strips , his left carotid pulse was 2+ without bruit , he had
no lymphadenopathy , and his oropharynx was benign. LUNGS: Clear
bilaterally. CARDIAC: Examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm and he was tachycardic without a murmur. ABDOMEN:
Examination showed that bowel sounds were present and it was
benign. EXTREMITIES: Examination showed no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema , posterior tibial pulses were 2+/2+ , and his dorsalis pedis
pulses were trace bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed
that he was alert and oriented times three and grossly non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a normal SMA 7 , CBC which
had a white count of 3.7 , a hematocrit of
33.8 with 407 platelets , a sedimentation rate was 48 , his digoxin
level on transfer was 1.3 , his procainamide level was 2.6 , and his
NAPA was 1.1 on transfer. An EKG showed atrial flutter at 140.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1996 which revealed a left dominant system
with left anterior descending with serial 60% complex lesions , mid
left anterior descending 70% lesion , and a ramus 40% lesion. The
left circumflex was totally occluded proximally and the right
coronary artery was small with an 80% mid vessel stenosis. Left
ventriculogram revealed normal systolic function. On November ,
1996 , he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery with a
LIMA to his left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to his
OM1 , and a saphenous vein graft to his OM2. On May , 1996 ,
he developed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 180 range ,
blood pressure 160/90 , he complained of palpitations , and was
diaphoretic. He received Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times two ,
his blood pressure responded with decrease to 120/72 , and his heart
rate remained in the 140 range with atrial fibrillation. He
converted to normal sinus rhythm in the eighties. He was loaded
with Digoxin and maintained on Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. That
evening , he had a second episode of atrial fibrillation. On
March , 1996 , he underwent right carotid endarterectomy for an
asymptomatic 90% stenosis. In the PACU , he had atrial fibrillation
in the 150 range with decreased blood pressure to the seventies.
On March , 1996 , he had another episode of atrial fibrillation
lasting approximately thirty minutes which converted to normal
sinus rhythm with 5 mg of Lopressor. On January , 1996 , he
converted into atrial fibrillation at approximately 4 a.m. and his
blood pressure was 160/100 , his heart rate was approximately in the
130 range , and carotid sinus pressure produced no change in his
rate. An ECG revealed a supraventricular tachycardia at 130 beats
per minute , likely atrial flutter , with 2:1 conduction. Verapamil
5 mg q.5 minutes times two intravenously resulted in a heart rate
drop from 120 to 70 which revealed atrial flutter. At this point ,
he was transferred to Medicine for further management. His
medications on transfer included magnesium and potassium sliding
scale , Axid 150 p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet one to two tablets
p.r.n. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Benadryl
p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Procan
SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. started on March , 1996 , and Metamucil
p.r.n. Post-transfer , he was maintained on his cardiac regimen
overnight. He remained in atrial flutter throughout the night , was
slight diaphoretic but had no other associated symptoms. He was
cardioverted electrically on November , 1996 into normal sinus
rhythm with a heart rate in the seventies to nineties.
DISPOSITION: He is discharged on September , 1996 after
cardioversion in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
IDENTIFICATION: This is a 63 year old gentleman with diabetes
mellitus and peripheral vascular disease who was
transferred Ason Memorial Hospital after he had a positive
Persantine-Thallium test preoperatively for vascular surgery
procedure. The patient was transferred for cardiac
catheterization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors: Diabetes ,
history of smoking , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , positive family history.
This 63 year old gentleman is disabled as a consequence of cardiac
and peripheral vascular disease. The patient was transferred to
A Of Hospital from a Lane Pidesron Medical Center on 29 of January for management of
cellulitis and ulceration on the anterior tibial area on the left.
The patient was placed on antibiotics and noninvasive lower
extremity demonstrated significant aorto-iliac and occlusive
disease. The patient was started on IV heparin and antibiotics
with moderate improvement in the cellulitis. The patient&apos;s
metformin was discontinued and plans were made for aorto-bi-fem
angiography. However , the patient had a cardiology work-up
including echo and Persantine-Thallium which demonstrated
significant coronary ischemia. As a result , the patient was
transferred to Bello Medical Center for further evaluation
of his cardiac disease and for cardiac catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus for
12 to 15 years with consequence of diabetic
neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy. History of incontinence ,
status post bilateral carotid endarterectomy left in 1991 , right in
1995 after TIAs revealed amaurosis fugax. Status post ulnar nerve
transplant. Status post cholecystectomy in 1981 , Status post
laser for diabetic retinopathy. Hypothyroidism. Status post
removal of ganglion cyst of the left ankle.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. , Synthroid 0.125 mg q.d.
Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. , Isosorbide 10 mg t.i.d. ,
Percocet 1-2 tabs p.o. p.r.n. , Ativan , Zoosyn , Pravastatin 20 mg
p.o. q.d. , Diltiazem 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a disabled man , used to work in
pulling business , lives alone , divorced and has
five children , ages 27 to 40. Tobacco use - 2 and 1/2 to 3 packs
per day times 25 to 30 years. No significant alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died at age 55 from schizophrenia and
catatonia. Father age 57 from myocardial
infarction.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has had impotence times 10 years.
Post prandial fullness times several years.
Rest pain and unable to walk more than 10 feet because of the
severe lower extremity pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an anxious man lying in his
bed. Vitals - T 99.2 , heart rate 82 , blood
pressure 128/70 , respiratory rate 20. Oxygen saturation was 94% on
room air. HEENT: Significant for bilateral carotid bruits. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. Cardiovascular - Regular rate and
rhythm. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds , nondistended , nontender.
Extremities - The patient had bilateral femoral bruits. No
palpable pedal pulses. Nonhealing intertibial ulcer. However , the
patient had no cyanosis.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 102 , CO2 28 ,
creatinine of 1.1 , BUN 13 , glucose 139 , WBC 9.1.
Hematocrit 39.3 , platelets of 219 , PT 12.1 , PTT 28.4 , INR 1.0 , ABI
from Tors Medical Center - right DP was 0.44 , PT 0.21 , left DP
0.51 , PT 0.44.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for cardiac work-up.
Since the patient had received a week of IV
antibiotics , the cellulitis seemed to have resolved. The Zoosyn
was stopped. The patient&apos;s cardiac medications were continued.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization on 15 of July which revealed
60% RCA , 50% lad , 60 to 70% D-1 and 100% distal left circumflex
lesion with an ejection fraction of 55%. Thus coronary artery
disease would not need revascularization prior to peripheral
vascular surgery.
As a result , the patient will be transferred to Reedpersi Memorial Hospital for vascular surgical procedure. The patient was strongly
advised against smoking , however , he continued to smoke frequently
throughout the hospitalization course.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Dulcolax 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Diltiazem SR 150
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 5 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Synthroid 125 mcg p.o. q.d. ,

ATTENDING: SARE , EDWARDO M.D.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
NIDDM and hypertension. He was transferred from an outside hospital after
presenting there with sudden onset of substernal
chest pain radiating to his neck and jaw and associated with
shortness of breath. The patient denied having nausea , vomiting
or diaphoresis. In the ambulance he was given three sprays of
nitroglycerin and his pain improved. In the Emergency
Department , he was noted to have a blood pressure of 200/100 ,
however had no ischemic ST changes on his EKG. His initial
troponin was less than 0.04. He was admitted to that hospital
CCU where he was started on an IV nitroglycerin drip and heparin
drip. The following day , his troponin had risen to 0.3 and he
had small ST elevations in his aVF. He was loaded with Plavix
and started on IV Integrilin and was transferred to In Medical Center for catheterization and further treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , peripheral vascular disease
with 3.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm , diabetes mellitus treated
with oral agents at home , hypercholesterolemia and COPD with
bronchodilator therapy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease. The
patient&apos;s father had a myocardial infarction at age 72. The
patient&apos;s son died of spontaneous DVT/PE at age 32.
SOCIAL HISTORY: A 24-pack-year history of cigarette smoking.
The patient quit smoking 30 years ago.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Toprol-XL 100 mg daily , Diovan 320 mg
daily , hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily , metformin , aspirin 325
mg daily and Pulmicort twp puffs b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Height 5 feet 10 inches , weight 107 kg.
Vital signs , temperature 97.3 degrees , heart rate 78 , blood
pressure 130/80 , O2 saturation 97% on room air. HEENT: PERRLA ,
dentition without evidence of infection , no carotid bruits.
Chest: No incisions. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm ,
no murmurs. Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft , no masses. Extremities , without scarring ,
varicosities or edema. Neuro: Alert and oriented , no focal
deficits. Pulses 2+ bilaterally at carotids , radials , femorals
and PTs. 1+ bilaterally at DPs. Allen&apos;s test of the right and
left upper extremities were both normal.
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1 , glucose 173 , magnesium 1.8 ,
white blood cell count 10 , hematocrit 41.2 , hemoglobin 14.3 ,
platelets 236. PT 14.5 , INR 1.1 , PTT 32.3. Preoperative
urinalysis was normal. Cardiac catheterization performed on
10/27/07 at Ertrea Health showed stenoses in the
following coronary arteries: 70% proximal circumflex , 90% ostial
ramus , 90% proximal D1 , 90% proximal LAD and 100% ostial RCA.
There was right dominant circulation and the ventriculogram
showed 56% ejection fraction with inferior hypokinesis. EKG on
10/27/07 showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 71.
There are Q waves in leads III and aVF and inverted T waves in
leads I , III , aVR , aVL and V1 through V4. Chest x-ray on
10/27/07 shows clear lungs with mild cardiomegaly and a stable
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization on 10/2/07. He was found to have critical
coronary artery disease and was referred to the Cardiac Surgery
Service. The patient underwent a completion of a preoperative
workup and on 9/5/07 went to the operating room where Dr.
Wink performed a CABG x5. The LIMA was used to bypass the LAD ,
the left radial artery was used to bypass the ramus , and
saphenous vein was used to bypass the OM1 , PDA and LVB1. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 145 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 116 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On
postoperative day #1 , the patient was extubated. He complained of
right hand weakness and numbness but was otherwise recovering
very well. The Neurology Service was consulted and they suggested
that the right hand symptoms were from surgical manipulation of
the chest or positioning of the arm intraoperatively.
Occupational therapy and physical therapy were consulted to treat
the patient&apos;s right hand weakness and numbness. Otherwise , the
patient was progressing very well. He was started on Lopressor
to prevent atrial fibrillation and diltiazem for his radial
artery bypass graft. He was off all hemodynamic drips and was in
a stable rhythm with a stable blood pressure. The patient&apos;s diet
was advanced as tolerated and he was producing good urine output.
The patient was followed very closely throughout the
postoperative period by the Diabetes Management Service for high
glucose levels. On postoperative day #2 , the patient&apos;s pacer
wires and chest tubes were removed without complication. He was
ambulating and showed good postoperative progress. On
postoperative days 3 and 4 , the patient continued diuresis for
postoperative fluid retention. The patient&apos;s white blood cell
count was noted to be 13.7 and a urinalysis and urine culture
were sent. The urine culture grew greater than 100 , 000 colony
forming units of gram-negative rods and he was started on
ciprofloxacin for five-day course for postoperative urinary tract
infection. Otherwise , by postoperative #5 the patient had
progressed extremely well. He was ambulating in the halls. He
had moved his bowels and had no difficulties with urination.
He had no complaints of pain. He had remained in a sinus rhythm
with a stable blood pressure and was oxygenating well on room
air. The patient was ready for discharge home. The Diabetes
Management Service met with the patient to discuss taking insulin
at home for his poor glucose control. He agreed to take Lantus
at night and follow up with his primary care physician for future
management of his diabetes mellitus. On the morning of discharge
home , the patient&apos;s vital signs were temperature 97.7 degrees ,
heart rate 86 in the sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/70 ,
respiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation 95% on room air. The
patient was still 5 kg above his preoperative weight and should
continue Lasix for five more days , once he is discharged home.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs on the day of discharge home. Sodium 136 ,
potassium 4.6 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 25 , creatinine 1 , BUN
23 , glucose 165 , calcium 8.2 , magnesium 2 , white blood cell count
10.6 , hemoglobin 10.5 , hematocrit 30.3 , platelets 279 , PT 15.2 ,
INR 1.2.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged home with VNA Services.
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat , 2100
calorie per day ADA diet.
ACTIVITY: The patient should be walking as tolerated and elevate
his feet with prolonged periods of sitting. The patient should
arrange followup appointments with his cardiologist Dr. Trilt ,
at 320-875-7887 in one to two weeks , with his primary care
physician , Dr. Cordial at 412-768-2098 in two to four weeks and
with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Maxwell Pullins at 869-541-1864 in four
to six weeks.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Acetaminophen 325 mg take one to two
tablets every four hours as needed for pain , enteric-coated
aspirin 325 mg daily , Pulmicort inhaler two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.12 h. , take 9 more doses to complete
a five-day course for postoperative urinary tract infection ,
diltiazem 15 mg p.o. t.i.d. for six weeks for the radial artery
bypass graft , Lasix 60 mg daily x5 more doses for postoperative
fluid retention , glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Motrin 600 mg p.o.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: As indicated , the patient should take Lasix
for five more days for postoperative fluid retention. The
patient should be weighed daily and the physician should be
contacted if the patient&apos;s weight , peripheral edema or work of
breathing is measurably increasing. The patient should complete
his course of ciprofloxacin for postoperative UTI. The patient&apos;s
vital signs should be monitored by the visiting nurses. In
addition his wound should be monitored for signs or symptoms of
infection. The patient was started on insulin and should follow
up with his primary care physician for future management of his
diabetes mellitus. He should be checking and documenting his
blood glucose levels with his home glucometer.

Discharge Date: 4/26/2000
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN OF UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Veltin is a 72 year old woman
with a past medical history
significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension
who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise
stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave
changes. She had a catheterization at that time which revealed
diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. In
1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was not
clear when exactly this happened. She stated that for the past
year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that
then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. Sometimes ,
there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position
and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past
two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three
times a week and was associated with shortness of breath. Two days
prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to
her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. She was quite
short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or
medication noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which she
took insulin and checked her sugars at home
which ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she had
idiopathic drop attacks. She got these episodes where her legs
fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose
consciousness. She had had an MRI/MRA that showed some diffuse
small vessel disease but the MRA was normal.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10
q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dye
caused hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She was a retired nurses&apos; aide who retired in
1992 , she was a widow , and she had two living
children who were grown. She lived alone and took care of her
eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who
lived next door.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly
obese African-American woman lying in bed in
some mild respiratory distress. Her oropharynx was moist , her
jugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered crackles
at the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was soft
and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal
examination showed guaiac negative brown stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a left bundle branch block
and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary
edema and Kerley B lines. Her laboratories on admission were all
within normal limits. Her initial CK was 97 with troponin of 0.01.
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiple
cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of
unclear etiology. She was admitted for evaluation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted for
catheterization which showed three vessel
disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the
catheterization in 1997. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She had an echo which showed some element of diastolic
dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RA
but no wall motion abnormalities. It was felt that she had some
element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit
of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. Therefore ,
while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood
pressure regimen was advanced. Her heart rate was in the fifties
to sixties and Atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. She was on a maximum
of Lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release was
added and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintained
systolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. This could
be further titrated as an outpatient.
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately
four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and
would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.
for further diuresis.
3. Pulmonary - She did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on room
air while lying in bed. This was felt to be out of proportion to
her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.
Her D-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a V/Q scan
which was low probability. Her lower extremity noninvasives were
negative. She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitial
lung disease. She had pulmonary function tests which were
consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from
her pulmonary function tests in 1998. A pulmonary consultation was
obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with
obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of
her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of
breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on
room air.
4. Endocrine - She was maintained on metformin during admission
and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of NPH given her
decreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated that
her sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were
170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions to
check her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.
DISPOSITION: She is discharged in stable condition on January ,
2000. She will follow up with Dr. Nakajima , her primary
care doctor , and in addition , with Dr. Klang , her cardiologist.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipine
extended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24
q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and Lasix 20
milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.

Discharge Date: 4/8/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ORAL HERPES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old man with
a longstanding history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure who was originally
admitted on 30 of March with worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion
for augmentation of cardiac function. He was well until l96l when
he initially presented with left bundle-branch block , left
ventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. He then had
high grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated with
Quinaglute. Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination was
notable for worsening left ventricular function. In l988 , he had
recurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle with
an ejection fraction of around 32%. His coronary arteries showed
acute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. In
1/5 , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. In
2/8 , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestive
heart failure. Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. He was
treated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. In
March , he was admitted to the Worthrest Hospital for
worsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. He was
managed with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimately
decided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. He was then placed on
the Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation.
Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicycle
with O2 uptake of l2. Right heart catheterization showed wedge
pressure of 25. PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound was
negative. Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apical
thrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral
regurgitation. Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins within
normal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. He had
negative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. CMV showed
borderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG and
negative IgM. Since his discharge in August , he has noted
worsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance and
increased orthopnea.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up being
started on Dobutamine and had gradually declining
course during his admission culminating in having a cardiac
transplant when a heart became available. This occurred on
10/9/9l. His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his
subsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of his
renal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with the
Cyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. His renal
function returned to baseline. He also developed an oral herpes
lesion. He subsequently did very well post-operatively. Multiple
right ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. On biopsy
on 11/21 , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 ,
right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. He tolerated
slow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that he
had some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed to
Cyclosporin toxicity. Other than that , his post-operative course
was uncomplicated.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on 1/13/9l. He is
to have follow-up with Dr. Blay as well as Dr. Hori
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Persantine 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Clotrimazole
Troche one p.o. q.i.d. , Bactrim DS one p.o. q.o.d. , Procardia XL 60
mg p.o. q.d. , Cyclosporin l50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Carafate one gram
p.o. q.i.d. , Prednisone taper per the Transplant Team , Imuran 50 mg
p.o. q.d. , Restoril l5 to 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Acyclovir Ointment
5% to lip six times per day. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CHEST PAIN , FOR RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES
3. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
4. HYPERTENSION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old , Spanish
speaking woman with multiple cardiac
risk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. The
patient&apos;s cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,
previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal state
secondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogen
replacement therapy. The patient has a two to three year history
of exertional angina. Of note , approximately one year ago she
began to have substernal chest pain at rest. The patient states
that currently she is having approximately three episodes a day on
average. She describes these as substernal chest pressure which
radiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. She denies any
associated shortness of breath but does occasionally note
diaphoresis. She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.
In September of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram which
showed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction of
approximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild
tricuspid regurgitation. Since this time she has been followed by
Dr. Maximo Bryum in C&amp;O MEDICAL CENTER Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimen
which resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. Of note the
patient recently stopped taking Aspirin. Her symptoms then
recurred. On the 5 of February , 1995 the patient underwent a
Dobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 seconds
reaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.
The test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. The MIBBE showed
moderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wall
ischemia. Of note , on the morning of admission the patient was
seen by her VNA. During her VNA&apos;s visit the patient began to have
her typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw as
well as shortness of breath. She denied any diaphoresis or nausea.
The patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after her
primary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately
15 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 year
history of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications including
neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic atrial fibrillation included a
normal TSH. Hypertension. Degenerative joint disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux. Status post hysterectomy approximately 21
years ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,

q.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure
141/73 , O-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,
respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. HEENT exam showed pupils equal
round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact.
Oropharynx was clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck was
supple with full range of motion. Jugular venous pressure was
difficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around the
neck. Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. Cardiac exam showed an
irregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
right shin scar which was healing well. There was no clubbing or
cyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. Rectal examination
was guaiac negative. On neurologic examination the patient was
alert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.
Strength was 5/5 bilaterally. There was decreased sensation to
light touch bilaterally in the lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission Sodium 134 , Potassium 4.7 , Chloride
96 , Bicarb 22 , BUN 28 , Creatinine 1.3 , Blood
Glucose 472 , Digoxin level 1.0. PT 14.5 , PTT 26. Urinalysis was
negative. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with a
normal axis. T wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and F
and Q waves were noted in V-1 through V-3. Chest x-ray showed no
evidence of infiltrates or effusions. There was borderline
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Medicine Team Voone Parkway , Ainggo Ra I , Alaska 89772
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with
serial CK , MB and EKG&apos;s. Heparin was initially started given the
possibility that this was unstable angina. The Cardiology Team was
consulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.
On further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided to
schedule a cardiac catheterization. This was performed on the 7 of October and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including a
right atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PA
pressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. The coronary
arteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function was
also assessed as normal. The patient tolerated this procedure well
and without complications. Given the confluence of her data , two
possible explanations were postulated including either syndrome X
or small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. The
patient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization and
was prepared for discharge. Also during her hospital course the
patient&apos;s Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep her
blood sugars in the approximately 200 range.

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99.2 , pulse 89 ,
blood pressure 130/86 , respiratory rate 20 , and oxygen saturation
100% on room air. General , the patient is in no acute distress ,
but is unable to talk with the trach tube currently in place.
HEENT , mucous membranes are moist and there are no OP lesions.
Neck , JVP is not appreciated due to the patient&apos;s body habitus.
Cardiovascular , heart rate is regular , regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Chest , decreased breath sounds in all
fields with a prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen , bowel sounds
are present , abdomen is obese , nontender , and there is a G tube
in place. Extremities , no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Extremities are obese. Skin , no rashes or bruises. Neurologic ,
no cranial nerve , sensory , or motor deficits noted. Gait is
deferred.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: The patient&apos;s CBC reveals a
hematocrit of 29.2 , which is consistent with her baseline of 28
to 30. Her CBC , chem-7 , and LFTs are all unremarkable.
PROCEDURES:
1. Trach tube change - the patient&apos;s tracheostomy tube was
changed to a Custom #6 Bivona on 10/21/05 by Dr. Klatt ( Surgery ).
2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 5/28/05 and
revealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,
compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue
was noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to
potentially compromise the airway.
3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was
performed on 10/21/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.
The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the
General Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over
the course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged
on numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or
respiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.
However , the patient remained stable throughout these events with
a pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the
tube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6
Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube
without incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the
tube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer
therapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the
patient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%
on trach mask oxygen.
2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the
patient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile
decannulation. However , this procedure revealed
excessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and
what appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this
finding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could
compromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,
the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her
upper airway. Throughout this hospital
course , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to
use a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use
one with her trach tube in place.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient&apos;s history of
recurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient
underwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible
aspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty
during this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the
patient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid
restrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the
patient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these
may be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. August Adkinson , General Surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient&apos;s
temperature was 97.8 , pulse 81 , blood pressure 122/84 ,
respiratory rate 22 , and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental
oxygen of 30% by trach mask. General , no acute distress ,
pleasant , obese woman. HEENT , mucous membranes are moist.

Discharge Date: 10/12/1996
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATYPICAL ANGINA AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 76 year old male with
increased anginal symptoms for
approximately one month post-PTCA. This patient had known
multivessel coronary artery disease status post angioplasty
admitted with six hours of rest chest pain with non-diagnostic EKG
changes and initial troponin and CK negative. Patient&apos;s risk
factors include a history of hypertension , prior history of
tobacco , non-insulin dependent diabetes , his age , and sex. In
April 1995 , the patient developed his first symptoms of cardiac
angina. He was admitted on 7/10/95 with chest pain at rest and
minimal EKG changes. CK initially was 210 and MB was not done.
Patient did not rule in. On 10/23/95 , the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization with elevated right atrial pressure of 39
and 14 , mildly elevated , and three vessel disease with 70% proximal
stenosis of his left anterior descending artery , 90% apical
stenosis with 30% stenosis of the left circumflex , and two serial
95% stenoses distally of the left circumflex noted. His first
diffuse marginal branch had 30% to 40% diffuse luminal irregularity
in his right coronary artery. Posterior descending artery was
noted to have a 90% mid stenosis. Systolic function was normal
with ejection fraction of 71%. On 10/23/95 , the patient had a
balloon angioplasty of the proximal and 95% stenosis of his left
circumflex artery. On 11/1/95 , the patient continued to complain
of chest pressure. He underwent exercise tolerance test. He went
five minutes and one second stopping secondary to leg fatigue with
a 2 mm ST segment depression. He underwent cardiac catheterization
with angioplasty of his mid posterior descending artery with 30%
residual stenosis and a small dissection of the inferior margin of
the vessel. He was discharged home aspirin , Lisinopril , Atenolol ,
Micronase , and enoxaparin. Patient was well at home until the day
of his admission when he had retrosternal chest pressure of 10/10
at approximately 6 p.m. He took three sublinguals without relief
and presented to the Emergency Room with 5/10 chest pressure. In
the Emergency Room , he had some relief of his chest pressure with
sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous nitroglycerin brought
significant relief. He had non-diagnostic EKG changes but was
admitted to the CCU for concern for unstable anginal pattern.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for C4-C5 radiculopathy with
steroid injection for pain control , inguinal
hernia , and benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral
resection of the prostate.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d. , Lisinopril
7.5 q.d. , Atenolol 75 q.d. , Micronase 5 q.d. ,
and enoxaparin 60 mg q.12h.
ALLERGIES: Patient was allergic to penicillin with a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was in no acute
distress with a heart rate of 54 , blood
pressure 114/78 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturation 97% on four
liters. On 100 micrograms of nitroglycerin and Heparin , there was
no chest discomfort. HEENT: Benign. LUNGS: Few basilar
crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination showed bradycardia with
II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex.
ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a potassium
of 3.9 , hematocrit of 37.1 , troponin of 0 ,
and CK initially of 121. EKG revealed a sinus bradycardia with
normal intervals , normal axis , and no new change as compared to old
EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Assessment was that this was basically a 76 year
old with known coronary artery disease presenting
with unstable angina with no significant troponin or CK values.
Given his history of recent intervention and coronary artery
disease , this appeared consistent with unstable angina. The
patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with his CK flat
and repeat troponin of 0. He was continued on intravenous Heparin
and nitroglycerin in the interval amount of time until he ruled out
and his aspirin therapy was decreased down to 81 with simvastatin
started. Patient received repeat catheterization on 1/9/96 which
revealed 50% stenosis at the mid left circumflex at the PTA site ,
30% to 40% stenosis of the distal posterior descending artery at
the PTA site , 40% proximal left anterior descending , 95% distal
left anterior descending at the apex , and 70% distal left
circumflex giving rise to two PLV branches. The plan was that the
patient would get a distal left circumflex PTCA tomorrow when there
would be surgical back-up available. The patient was continued on
intravenous Heparin and nitroglycerin overnight without any
recurrent chest discomfort. On 10/16/96 , the patient had PTCA
times three at the mid left circumflex 50% to 60% stenosis
ballooned to 30% , distal left circumflex 80% stenosis was ballooned
to 30% residual , and distal left anterior descending with 90%
stenosis ballooned to 20% residual. Post-PTCA , the patient was
continued on Heparin overnight without any recurrent chest
discomfort. There was a issue with this patient of whether his
chest discomfort given its atypical nature was cardiac in etiology
although he definitely had disease on angiography but he had
significant possibility for other etiologies as a source for his
discomfort such as cervical radiculopathy with left arm numbness
and occasional anterior chest discomfort which he had difficulty
distinguishing from any anginal-like discomfort. He also had a
history of gastrointestinal distress with frequent gaseousness.
The patient was basically observed 24 hours after his Heparin was
stopped , he was restarted on enoxaparin , and continued on aspirin ,
Captopril , Lopressor , and simvastatin. Patient did not have any
recurrent chest discomfort in the interim observation and he was
discharged home on a stable out-patient regimen. Additional
in-house issues included that gastrointestinally , patient was
continued on Prilosec and Maalox therapy for his gaseousness and
gastrointestinal distress. Given the crackles on examination , he
had a chest x-ray which was negative for any infiltrate and he
required some O2 supplementation initially when he presented but he
was weaned off O2 prior to discharge. As far as his diabetes , he
continued on his out-patient Micronase with b.i.d. fingerstick
monitoring which was normal. Fluids , electrolyte , and nutrition
wise , his potassium and magnesium were kept optimally repleted
given his cardiac history.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Micronase 5 mg q.d. ,
Lisinopril 2.5 mg q.d. , and sublingual nitroglycerin.
FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr.
Rater for cardiac follow-up. The plan was that
he would call Dr. Hedges for follow-up.

ALLERGIES:
Mr. Shanafelt has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 96.2 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate was
62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. His
oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alert
and in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure was
approximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulses
paradoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the right
base with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft and
distended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.
The extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.
His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
His sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was
100 and his bicarb was 21. His BUN was 140 and his creatinine
was 7.0. His white blood cell count was 8.4 and his hematocrit
was 26.1. His INR was 2.5. His calcium was 9.0. His EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This was
a paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload and
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: On admission , Mr. Muraski had significant volume
overload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence of
pulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of
140. His creatinine had also increased from his baseline
creatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examination
the morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slow
asterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On 8/26/05 , the
tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internal
jugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure was
tolerated without complication. Mr. Stahlnecker had his first run of
hemodialysis on 9/27/05 , which he tolerated well with subsequent
improvement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.
He again underwent hemodialysis on 5/30/05 , 9/15/05 and
9/14/05. In addition , he underwent a two-hour run of
ultrafiltration on 5/24/05 with removal of nearly four liters of
fluid. Mr. Lavergne will continue with intermittent hemodialysis
on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge from
Belllit Community Hospital . Plans are underway for Mr. Schroeppel
to have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on
4/3/05 with vascular surgery at F.shands Ieldmormode Hospital .
2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. Grassman was maintained
on a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On
9/27/05 , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphorus
level of 5.8. However , on 5/24/05 , his phosphorus level was 1.8
and therefore his Phoslo was held.
3. Cardiovascular: Mr. Wallau has a long history of
hypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. His
systolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during this
admission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. He
was also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,
lisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. In
addition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.
Bacus blood pressure did not return to a normal level after he
was dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to be
continued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additional
medicines added. In addition , Mr. Mok has a history of
coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He was
initially due to be discharged on 9/15/05 , but shortly after
hemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sided
chest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.
4. Hematology: Mr. Buetti is maintained on Coumadin for history
of deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , his
Coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K as
well as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. He
was subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titrated
while being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mg
and he will be discharged on that dose.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Woodburn has a history of diabetes mellitus and
was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Infectious Disease: Mr. Goodyear became febrile to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit on 1/13/05. He was again febrile on 9/14/05. His
urine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which was
subsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to his
sensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.
When it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant to
levofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on
1/18/05. He should receive several additional days of
gentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosed
after hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.
Montogomery did have one positive blood culture from 7/18/05 that
grew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of this
dictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew out
these gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycin
in the early morning of 1/18/05. It was felt that this blood
culture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his other
blood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.
DISPOSITION:
Mr. Mckean will be discharged to the Westjo Hospital His
blood pressure and INR will need to be monitored. He will
continue on hemodialysis three times per week. He has an
appointment at vascular surgery on 4/3/05 to plan for AV
fistula formation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
He was afebrile. He was alert and conversational. He had
occasional rales at his bases. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at his left sternal border.
His abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds , it was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. His extremities were warm and there was no
edema. He showed no signs of uremia with no asterixis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Goodwine is a 78-year-old
gentleman with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
myocardial infarction in 1998 with known ejection fraction of
20%. PET scan in October of 2006 revealed decreasing ejection
fraction and severe left anterior descending territory perfusion
defect. The patient was planned to be electively cathed , but has
deferred until now because of seasonal allergies. The patient
admits to baseline dyspnea on exertion. Cardiac catheterization

Discharge Date: 2/29/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Almon is a 51 year old gentleman
with history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus and unstable angina. The patient was doing yard
work in the afternoon when he experienced an episode of nausea and
vomiting along with chest discomfort. The patient presented to his
primary care physician who noted EKG changes with ST depressions in
V3 to V6 and was sent to the emergency room which was noted to have
an old T wave inversion in lead 3 which was now upright and ST
depressions that were normalizing. CKs at that time were 974 , MB
24.3 , Troponin level was 1.77. The patient received aspirin 5 mg
of intravenous Lopressor , Heparin drip and Adenosine MIBI which was
performed back in April of 1999 revealed inferior ischemia. The
patient underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 2001 which
revealed the following: Right dominant system , no significant left
main lesions identified , left anterior descending coronary artery
with a discreet mid 65% lesion , distal 99% lesion and first
diagonal coronary artery with a proximal discrete 70% lesion , left
circumflex coronary artery with a distal after the second obtuse
marginal discrete 60% lesion , supplying the second obtuse marginal.
First marginal coronary artery had an ostial discrete 90% lesion
and a second obtuse marginal had an ostial discrete 100% lesion.
Right coronary artery had a mid discrete 95% lesion supplying the
right posterior descending coronary artery. He was also noted to
have collateral flow from left anterior descending artery to the
right posterior descending artery. The patient underwent
echocardiogram on June , 2001 which revealed the following: 1.
There was mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced
with an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is severe
hypokinesis of the basal and mid segments of the inferior wall and
inferior septum. In addition , there is severe hypokinesis of the
posterior wall , apex and distal anterior wall. THis is suggestive
of multiple coronary artery disease. 2. The right ventricle
appears normal in size and systolic function. 3. The mitral valve
appears mildly thickened. The anterior mitral leaflet is mildly
elongated and there might be mild systolic prolapse of the anterior
leaflet. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. The aortic valve
is trileaflet and appears mildly thickened. There is no aortic
stenosis or regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve appears
structurally normal. No significant tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. 6. There is no pericardial effusion.

429448782 | CATCH | 95689635 | | 572179 | 2/25/2002 12:00:00 AM | CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/19/2002 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 1/23/2002
Mr. Shinaberry is a 73-year-old gentleman who returned to Surgluthe Leon Calcner Healthcare to the emergency room on 8/20/02 with crescendo
spontaneous angina and shortness of breath. He is three and one
half months after a presentation with subacute left circumflex
thrombosis , ischemic mitral regurgitation , pulmonary edema and a
small nontransmural myocardial infarction. His angiography at that
time revealed diffuse coronary atherosclerosis with attenuation and
diffuse narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery
and a small codominant right coronary system with extensive diffuse
disease. Large circumflex system with focally severe and
additional diffuse but noncritical stenosis with superimposed
thrombus. Dilatation of the left circumflex resulted in extensive
dissection but with eventual achievement of a very good
angiographic and clinical result after placement of multiple stents
and that his course was that of gradual recovery and uneventful
return home.
He remained frail and limited prior to this admission and
approximately six weeks prior to admission , began to have
occasional pain and shortness of breath. He went to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory for intervention. He underwent a
rotablator procedure on 8/20/02 in the cath. laboratory which
resulted in perforation of circumflex coronary artery into the
pericardial space with extravasation of blood. He went into
cardiogenic shock which was alleviated by intra-aortic balloon pump
placement and was seen in consultation by the cardiac surgery
service for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. He went to
the operating room on 8/20/02 where he underwent emergent coronary
artery revascularization. He sustained a retained rotablator burr
in the left circumflex system and a left circumflex perforation.
He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery , saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal #2 , #3 and #1 and removal of a
rotablator burr , repair of the left ventricular apex vent. site.
He came off bypass on 2 mcg of epinephrine and his intra-aortic
balloon pump. During his code in the cath. lab , the patient had
become hypotensive requiring intubation and intra-aortic balloon
pump placement as noted above. A Foley catheter was placed by the
urology service attending with much difficulty. His chest was left
open at the time of operation as the patient was coagulopathic and
Esmarch closure was placed.
His postoperative course: His coagulopathy was reversed with blood
products and his chest was closed without event on August , 02. He
was also seen in consultation by the diabetic management service to
help with his diabetic management. He continued to have
postoperative cardiac failure , remained on Dopamine , intra-aortic
balloon pump , was slowly weaned and diuresis ensued. His
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on postoperative day three
uneventfully. He continued to make good improvement and was
extubated on postoperative day four and transferred to the
step-down unit. He had mild confusion but has had a history of
cerebrovascular accident in the past. He still requires diuresis.
Chest tubes remained in place for very high chest tube output. He
was seen in consultation by the vascular surgery service for his
severe peripheral vascular disease and painful right foot. He was
also continued to be followed by urologic service and his Foley was
left in place. He did have a bump in his BUN and creatinine and
renal consult was obtained and helps with management of his fluid
balance. He was also seen in consultation by the thoracic surgery
service for increased chest tube output , mainly from the right
pleural chest tube. His other chest tubes were discontinued
without any complications and his acute renal failure began to
resolve. He received Albumin and packed cells to correct
hypoalbuminemia and also his postoperative anemia along with Lasix
for diuresis. He continued to make slow improvement and advanced
nutritionally. He had a vascular MRI which was done as requested
by vascular surgery service in preparation for potential
revascularization to his right leg. He continued to improve. His
BUN and creatinine were 90/3.5 at their highest level and have been
slowly declining over the past several weeks to today&apos;s level of 47
for BUN and 1.3 for creatinine. He continues to have low blood
cell counts; his white blood cell count is 3 today and his
hematocrit is 32.8. Platelet count is 98. He will require
follow-up for these on a two times weekly basis. His MRI shows
mild irregularity of the distal abdominal aorta as well as the left
common iliac artery , mild narrowing over long segment about three
cm. over the right external iliac artery. There is moderate focal
narrowing in the right common femoral artery at the bifurcation
between the superficial femoral and deep femoral and there is
complete occlusion in the distal right superficial femoral artery
with reconstitution three cm further. Multiple areas of focal
narrowing are seen in the proximal and distal left superficial
femoral artery , high grade stenosis in the proximal left popliteal
artery. The posterior tibial artery on the right side is
completely occluded proximally. On the left side , there is high
grade stenosis in the anterior tibial proximally as well as
occlusion of the anterior tibial in the mid calf with
reconstitution distally and complete occlusion of the posterior
tibial artery at it&apos;s origin. Peroneal shows moderate posterior
stenosis. He has moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease in the
lower extremities with multiple areas of narrowing inclusion. He
is to follow-up with Dr. Erasmo Gayler , Division of Vascular
Surgery for revascularization of his lower extremities.
Mr. Leitman is to be discharged on the following medications:
Meclizine 20 mg once a day , simvastatin 10 mg once a day , Lopressor
25 mg three times a day , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg once a day ,

Benign oropharynx. Moist mucous membranes. Pulmonary: Showed
no wheezes , rhonchi , or crackles , and a clear exam to
auscultation in both lung fields. Cardiovascular: Regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. No murmur , rub , or gallop

cyanosis , clubbing , or edema appreciated. She had 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent laboratory findings at the time of
admission include hematocrit of 36.3 , white count of 7.7 , and
platelets 317 , 000. Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 102 , and creatinine 2.8. Glucose was 88.
Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function
tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. Her EKG on
admission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats per
minute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG from
September , 2005.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient&apos;s Imdur and
labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor
renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV
hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.
Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,
the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February ,
2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In
addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was
monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second
hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of
beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as
well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient&apos;s
creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient
was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her
hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the
130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of
hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid
with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As
the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF
exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more
aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the
patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued
to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was
changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge
and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net
diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was
discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect
and maintaining adequate blood pressure.
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin
doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the
evening of August , 2005 , and the morning of February ,
2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but
was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There
were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,
which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on
aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for
the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain
events.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and
maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200
mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with
good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.
daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT
at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her
rhythm or rate standpoint.
4. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine returned to baseline by
hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal
failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to
admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further
issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive
hydration , taking good p.o. On November , 2005 , the patient
developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated
nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported
was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,
identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the
past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the
dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be
related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone
protocol was obtained on November , 2005 , which showed no
evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded
well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of
her symptoms by August , 2005 , hospital day #3.
5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by
August , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine
p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The
patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use
narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital
course.
6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home
dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and
regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,
ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.
This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital
setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation
recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.
and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested
minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As
such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the
patient continued to express preference for twice daily
injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her
hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In
addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which
showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was
increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her
endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted
on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss
secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over
course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a
low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white
blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially
given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started
on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She
remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her
urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of
mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal
limits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapy
was required.
9. The patient was discharged home on January , 2005 , with
VNA services.
PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:
1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and
to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well
as her Synthroid regimen.
2. To have followup with Dr. Polashek in the Coumadin Clinic to
maximize her Coumadin therapy and ensure that she is therapeutic.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
2. Coumadin 1.5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Aspirin 81 p.o. daily.
4. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d.
5. Insulin NPH 35 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m.
6. Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. daily.
7. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4-mg tablet 1 tablet every 5
minutes x3 days for p.r.n. chest pain.
8. Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily.
9. Imdur 90 mg p.o. daily.
10. Potassium chloride slow release 40 mEq p.o. q.a.m.
11. Potassium chloride slow release 20 mEq p.o. q.p.m.
12. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.
13. Nexium 20 mg p.o. daily.
14. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
The patient has followup appointments with Dr. Sam Rochholz on
January , 2005 , at 10 a.m. and with Dr. Jude Raheja on
July , 2005 , at 11 a.m.; both of which are scheduled.

2.2 , BNP 18 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 35.2 ,
hemoglobin 11.9 , platelets 313 , PT 13.7 , INR 1 , and PTT 31.5.
Carotid imaging: Left and right internal carotid arteries , both
with 0% occlusion. Cardiac catheterization performed at Iland Frenchcal Clami General Hospital on 10/18/06 showed stenosis in the following
coronary arteries: 70% proximal PDA , 90% proximal LAD , 70% mid
circumflex with right dominant circulation. Ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 35%. EKG on 4/5/06 showed
normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. There was poor
R-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted T waves
in leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistent
with congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior to
her scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.
On 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where Dr.
Gonzale performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graft
to bypass the PDA. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107
minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. The vein
was harvested from both legs. The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remained
intubated for two days due to poor lung
compliance. She was also hypotensive in the postoperative period
and treated with vasoactive medications. By postoperative day
#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,
however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and her
Lopressor was increased. By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillation
was rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. By
postoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU to
the Step-Down Unit. At that point , she was neurologically intact
and her pain was well controlled. She was being treated with
beta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. From a respiratory
perspective , the patient was being treated with aggressive
pulmonary toilet and chest PT. Her chest x-ray showed a small
right pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well with
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient&apos;s diet was
advanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.
The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluid
retention. She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Service
throughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.
On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patient
experienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 and
she became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after her
diltiazem was increased. She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days.
During that time , the patient&apos;s hemodynamics stabilized although
she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. On
postoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to the
Step-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of her
hospital stay. The patient&apos;s chest x-ray suggested that she was
volume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated with
Lasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowly
from 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. The diuretics were decreased. A chest
ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesis
revealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis and
minimal effusion. The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonary
toilet and deep breathing and coughing. The patient continued to
ambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , the
patient&apos;s chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis in
the right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.
From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patient
was in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11
and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for the
final three days of her hospital stay. The patient had been
started on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation and
this medication should continue at least until she follow up with
a cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heart
rhythm. By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinus
rhythm with a stable blood pressure. She was oxygenating well on
room air and was ambulating effectively on her own. She had no
complaints and was ready for discharge to home. On that day , her
temperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,
blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% on
room air. The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperative
weight.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with VNA Services.
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100
calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.
ACTIVITY: The patient should be walking as tolerated and elevate
her feet with prolonged periods of sitting.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: The patient should arrange followup
appointments with her cardiologist Dr. Micheal Moresco at

nifedipine sprays immediately prior to exertion/activity.On 2/29/06 , pt
was evaluated for CABG by surgeon Dr. Ashley Starcher , who noted possible
candidacy for combined CABG/TMLR since diagonal likely too small to
bypass. Since pt was asymptomatic w/ nlm LVEF , he has remained on medical

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 63 year old female with hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease , who presents
two days status post a syncopal episode in the setting of chest
pain. Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , postmenopausal , and she has no
family history of coronary artery disease , and denies the use of
tobacco. Her cardiac history is as follows: She has a history of
chronic stable angina. She underwent a cardiac catheterization in
January of 1992 notable for 75% OM2 lesion , 50% ostial right RCA
lesion , and ejection fraction at the time was 75%. She had an ETT
performed in September of 1994 which she exercised for 3 minutes 42
seconds with a peak heart rate of 127 , systolic blood pressure of
156 , rate pressure product of 20k. She was stopped secondary to
chest pain , she had some T wave inversions in the inferolateral
leads felt to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia.
She also had an echocardiogram performed in August of 1994 with
an ejection fraction of 60-65% , no regional wall motion
abnormalities. She has been followed in the ONNAW HOSPITAL Clinic by Dr.
Stenehjem , maintained on the regimen of Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , enteric coated
aspirin , and Procardia XL 60 mg q.day. She reports her angina has
been stable for years. She takes 1-2 sublingual nitroglycerin per
week. Her pain is typically precipitated by brisk walking or other
forms of exercises. She reports that her daily workout consists of
some situps three times a day , and also usually a walk. She states
that two days prior to admission while walking her normal speed
towards the bus station , she developed some right chest wall
tightness and shortness of breath consistent with her typical
angina. She was in the middle of the street , decided to walk
across the street with the plan to take a sublingual nitroglycerin ,
however she felt light headed on continued ambulation and had a
syncopal episode. She reports that on awakening she had no
confusion. She did report the loss of urine incontinence but has
urinary incontinence at baseline. She denies any stool
incontinence , no seizure activity per observers. No complications
prior to the episode. She denies any orthopnea or PND at baseline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable for coronary artery disease , as
above. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes
mellitus , she is on insulin. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5.
Hypothyroidism. 6. History of guaiac positive stools. 7.
History of a frozen shoulder. 8. Vitamin B 12 deficiency. 9.
Gallstone disease. 10. Urinary incontinence. 11. History of a
cystocele.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , NPH insulin 66 units
q.AM and 15 units q.PM , Procardia XL 60 mg
q.day , metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. , vitamin B 12 1 mg IM q.month ,
Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 mg q.day , aspirin 325 mg
q.day , p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease. Positive
for diabetes mellitus in her mother and her
daughter. Also positive for lung cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Ral , Pennsylvania 83011 alone , no pets. She has
ten children , 32 grandchildren , and 4 great
grandchildren. She denies any use of tobacco or denies any use of
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 ,
heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 ,
respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. In
general , obese black female in no apparent distress. HEENT
examination was PERRL , EOMI , neck supple , full range of motion , she
had a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and
2+ pulses bilaterally. Lungs were clear. Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade
1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternal
border. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender ,
nondistended. She was guaiac negative. Extremities showed no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Neurologic examination
was grossly nonfocal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG on admission showed a heart rate of 73 ,
intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for PR ,
QRS , and QTC. Axis was 71. No Q waves and no acute ST or T wave
changes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 ,
bicarb 25 , BUN and creatinine of 16 and
1.3 , glucose of 282. LFTs were within normal limits. CK of 213 ,
cholesterol 179. Other labs showed a TSH of 1.5 , ferritin 181 ,
TIBC of 226 , troponin I was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count
7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. Coagulation studies were within
normal limits. Urinalysis showed 2-4 WBCs , 3+ bacteria. Her urine
culture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. This
is a urine culture from 7/24/96. A chest x-ray revealed no
infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIAC: Cardiac wise , she ruled out for an MI by enzymes and
EKG. She underwent a standard Bruce protocol ETT on 7/10/96. She
exercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. Maximum
heart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. She developed
typical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. She
had 1 mm down sloping ST segment depressions in II , III , F , V4
through V6 , which resolved into recovery. These changes were
suggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baseline
LVH. She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on
7/28/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid RCA , 90% stenosis at
the origin of the PDA , 30% mid LAD , and 50% OM2. She subsequently
underwent angioplasty of the RCA and the PDA lesion on 4/1/96 with
some mild haze at the PDA. Therefore , recommendations were for
heparinization for a 24 hour period. She remained pain free
throughout this hospitalization. The EPS Service saw her regarding
the issue of syncope. Further workup was performed including
carotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis in
either of the carotid arteries. She underwent a cardiac
echocardiogram on 2/4/96 to rule out evidence of regional wall
motion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior MI
as a source of potential ectopy. She was noted to have 2+ mitral
regurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and had
no reported regional wall motion abnormality. She also had no
arrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. The
EPS Service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the RCA
probably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes with
possible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. They favored
holding off on the EPS study. They felt that the revascularization
and follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for this
patient and recommendations are for follow-up ETT in four to six
weeks. Her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasing
her Lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as her
rate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. She remained pain
free throughout the hospitalization. She will have follow-up with
her primary M.D.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS: Her glucose remained under fairly good
control during this hospitalization with her regimen of NPH.
Hemoglobin A1C was checked and is pending at the time of discharge.
3. URINARY: She was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysis
and 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of 7/24/96. We
will empirically treat her for a UTI with Bactrim 1 DS b.i.d. times
three days.
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Amous She is to have an
appointment in one to two weeks. She is also to have a
follow-up ETT in four to six weeks. She should also have a repeat
urine culture in the NECTON BRYIN HAWEIR HEALTH Clinic during her follow-up.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg

ASSESSMENT AND HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
55F with ESRD on HD ( 2/2 DM ) who had apparent syncopal episode while
at HD on 7/12 , which was similar in presentation to 4/11 episode from
recent admission.
1 ) CV: Whether or not pt actually ever a V-fib arrest seems to be in some
doubt , as she has never had an arrhythmia on tele. However , given this
is the second presentation , a proper arrhythmia evaluation was
warranted. The pt&apos;s differential included arrythmia vs obesity
hypoventilation ( pt reports OSA sx ) , hypoglycemia , and HD-related
hypotension. Ischemia ) serial cardiac enzymes negative. Pt was
continued on asa , bb , and placed on statin and NTG prn while ruling out
ischemic heart disease in anticipation of possible EP study. PET
perfusion scan for reversible ischemia was negative , showing normal
perfusion. Pump: JVP not appreciated , decreased LE edema relative to
prior admission. pt was continued home dose diuretic , and kept on a BB ,
CCB , and her ACEi to goal SBP&lt;120. Rhythm: Pt was placed on telemetry to
monitor for arrythmia while on floor. No events were noted , but given
history , pt was taken to cath lab for EP study on 4/19/06. EPS showed
normal conduction , normal SA node , and so a loop recorder device was
implanted , which will monitor pt&apos;s HR and record if HR&gt; or &lt; parameters ,
or if pt triggers device to record. No signs/sx of bleeding , infectino ,
hematoma. Pt discharged on 3 day course of Keflex , to be given after HD.
RENAL: ESRD on HD. Pt HD on Wed and Sat am of admission , which she
tolerated with no difficulty. Pt was continued on EPO 10 , 000U qHD. Pt
has tunneled line in Right IJ for access.
HEME: Anemia: in setting of ESRD , baseline Hct around 30. Pt on
epogen. Anemia studies WNL.
ENDO: Diabetes type 2: Long and short-acting SC insulin. BID NPH
started at lower than home dose while oral diet is held , with lower
sliding scales , due to significant parts os stay where pt was NPO for
procedures. Wil lbe discharged on home insulin regimen.
ID: pt reports 4 day h/o productive cough prior to admission. Pt
afebrile , but on HD6 , pt has eleavtion in WBC ( 6.9--&gt;12 ) , however
pt afebrile , asymptomatic , CXR shows no infiltrative process , and in
setting of recent procedure. Pt was placed on levofloxacin renally dosed.
DERM: Brawny skin changes: Lac Hydrin started. Candidiasis noted in folds
between pt&apos;s pannus and groin. 2% Miconazole topical poder started
PPX: PT received heparin SC , and Nexium , wil be discharged on protonix.
Code: Pt is Full Code. Health care proxy is Brain Bruess
325-446-2221
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been evaluated for your unresponsive episodes. We looked at
your heart and put a recorder in your chest to monitor for any irregular
heartbeats. Please follow up with your appointments , and return to the
hospital if you notice any chest pain , lightheadedness , or if you pass out
again. YOu have also been referred for an outpatient sleep study to
evaluate your obstructive sleep apnea. Please make an appointment with
them if they do not contact you.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) We recommend pt get outpt polysomnography evaluation for OSA , and
potential fitting for CPAP. Referral placed , pt will receive call from
Torsba Dicli Errey Center 6- 754-443-2399 to make appointment for sleep study.
2 ) pt&apos;s home BP and insulin regimen unchanged.
3 ) ANtibiotics: continue pt&apos;s 3 day regimen of Keflex , in additino to 5
day regimen of Levofloxacin dosed renally for broader coverage.
4 ) started mild keratolytic Lac-Hydrin top BID for pt&apos;s brawny skin
changes.
5 ) short course miconazole 2% powder for pt&apos;s candidal nifectino in groin
skin folds

FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On presentation , T 97.3 , BP 143/70 , pulse 57 , 98%
on 2 liters. This is an obese female in no apparent distress ,
sitting up in bed. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Sclerae
anicteric. Neck: Supple , JVP at 14 cm. Chest: Crackles
bilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lung
fields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No
murmur , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous and
shiny shallow ulcerations. Neurologically , euthymic without
focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , significant for sodium 147 ,
potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , CO2 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose 69. CBC was significant for white count of 6.7 ,
hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. Her CK was 432. Her
troponin was less than assay. Her BNP was greater than assay and
D-dimer was 50 and 69.
Chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiac
enlargement. EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,
axis of -36 and no acute changes.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history of
congestive heart failure who presented with likely congestive
heart failure exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: There was concern regarding acute
and subacute silent ischemia given new ST-T wave changes in
lateral leads on the EKG. The patient was continued on her
aspirin as well as statin. She was ruled out for an MI with
negative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-dose
short-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). She was also continued on
an ACE inhibitor with this switched to captopril as a
short-acting ACE inhibitor , which was titrated up as tolerated
for a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. An adenosine MIBI
was performed which was negative for perfusion defects. However ,
echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workup
with cardiac catheterization. However , the patient refused the
catheterization.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
However , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
admission. She was monitored by cardiac telemetry with several
episodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and
repleted as necessary. She remained asymptomatic with the runs
of NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. Given her history
of atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,
she was restarted on Coumadin.
Pump: The patient presented with a frank fluid overload with
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , and a BNP greater than
assay. She was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than
-2 liters a day. She responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix t.i.d. Her
creatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,
at which point diuresis was put on hold. The patient diuresed
about 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until
7/7/03. At this point , she was thought to be very close to
euvolemic.
Given the patient&apos;s echo findings with depressed ejection
fraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilated
cardiomyopathy was begun. The patient did not wish for further
investigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. Her
other labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal ,
an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show iron
overload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of this
dictation. The patient will require close followup with careful
fluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestive
heart failure service.
Pulmonary: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
However , this resolved with diuresis. She has a history of PE as
well as DVT and an elevated dimer was found on admission. There
was initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution of
symptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive of
pulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiral
chest CT.
Heme: The patient&apos;s hematocrit was followed. The patient has
chronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continued
on folate and iron replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for her
known diabetes. Her blood sugars were in excellent control on
this regimen. Avandia was held given it contraindication in
heart failure.
Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is up
from about 0.8 in October of 2003. Her urine eosinophils and
sediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted which
is consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. Her creatinine
remained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when her
creatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when it
reached 2.7. Repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils and
sediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the time
of this dictation. The most likely explanation for increasing
creatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volume
depletion. Diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.
Given her increased creatinine , her ACE inhibitor dose was halfed
on 10/10/03. The plan is to continue to monitor her creatinine
function , follow up on her urine chemistries and if her
creatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.
Infectious Disease: The patient was found to have a UTI with E.
Coli that was sensitive to Bactrim and she was treated with
Bactrim with resolution.
Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well as
arthritis. Her Celebrex was held given her increased creatinine
and its propensity to cause fluid retention. Her joint exam
revealed swollen PIP joints of both hands as well as marked
swelling over both wrists. A rheumatoid factor was sent and that
came back negative. For her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.
Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitioned
to Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may be
more effected for her arthritis. ANA came back negative.
Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression.
Code status: Full code.
FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestive
heart failure service as well as her primary care physician.

ATTENDING: HEISSER III , MONROE JOSEPH MD
ADDENDUM
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Midget is a 56-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for inferior myocardial
infarction in 1995 , which was treated with angioplasty at that
time. Since then , he has been stable on medical management until
approximately two months prior to this admission , when he began
noting anterior chest pain with exertion. He underwent a stress
test , which was found to be abnormal , and was referred for cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was performed on
9/10/06 at Au Hospital . This study revealed a
70% proximal stenosis of his left anterior descending coronary
artery , a 90% mid segment stenosis of his first diagonal coronary
artery , a 50% mid segment stenosis of his circumflex coronary
artery , a 90% ostial stenosis of his first obtuse marginal , a
100% proximal stenosis of his right coronary artery as well as a
30% ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Collateral
flow was noted from the left anterior descending to the posterior
descending coronary artery. Given the results of this cardiac
catheterization , he was referred for elective revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s past medical history is
significant for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , lower back
pain , nephrolithiasis as well as a 3.4 cm infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm at the bifurcation of the aorta.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for open cholecystectomy in
the 1990s as well as removal of a cyst from his left wrist in
2005. In addition , the patient underwent lithotripsy in July of
2006.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports a family history of coronary
artery disease. His brother has undergone coronary artery bypass
grafting in the past and his mother , father and brother all have
suffered myocardial infarction. He also has a significant family
history of hypertension in both of his parents.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient reports a 20-pack-year cigarette
smoking history as well as a history of social alcohol use ,
approximately five to six beers on the weekend.
ALLERGIES: The patient reports no known drug allergies , however
tetanus immunization in the past has led to arm swelling.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril
40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg
p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o. daily , Vicodin 5 mg p.o. as
needed for low back pain as well as vitamins C , D , A , and E.
The patient was seen in the Lumne Medical Center on 10/27/06
and underwent physical examination.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination at that time revealed
the patient to be afebrile with resting heart rate of 52 beats
per minute and regular. The patient had a resting blood pressure
of 142/76 in the right arm and 148/76 in the left arm. He had a
room air oxygen saturation of 95%. Examination of the head ,
eyes , ears , nose and throat revealed the pupils to be equal ,
round , reactive to light and accommodation. The dentition was
without evidence of infection and carotid bruits were not
appreciable bilaterally over the carotid arteries. Examination
of the heart revealed it to be in regular rate and rhythm with a
grade 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal
border. Examination of the lungs revealed breath sounds to be
clear bilaterally throughout all lung fields. Examination of the
abdomen revealed a well-healed right upper quadrant incision
consistent with prior open cholecystectomy. Examination of the
extremities revealed them to be without scarring , varicosities or
edema and pulses were 2+ and equal to full extent of all
extremities. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented
x3 with no focal neurological deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values obtained in the Landsea Charle Memorial Hospital on 10/27/06 included a sodium of 139 , potassium of
3.7 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 82 , magnesium of
1.6 , white blood cell count of 10.9 , hematocrit 49.2 , and
platelet count of 386 , 000. Coagulation studies were within
normal limits with an INR of 1 and the urinalysis was within
normal limits. Cardiac catheterization data from 9/10/06 are as
stated above in the history of present illness. Echocardiogram
performed on 05/20/06 revealed a 65% ejection fraction with
trivial mitral valve insufficiency and no noted regional wall
motion abnormalities. EKG obtained on 9/10/06 showed a normal
sinus rhythm at 55 beats per minute with no acute ST or T-wave
changes. Chest x-ray performed on 9/27/2006 was without
evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/26/06 as a
same-day admission and was taken directly to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 including
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the ramus and second
obtuse marginal coronary arteries and the left radial artery to
the right coronary artery. Significant times of this operation
included a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 173 minutes with an
aortic cross-clamp time of 156 minutes. For further details of
this operation , please refer to the dictated operative note. The
patient&apos;s immediate postoperative period was uncomplicated. He
was extubated on the day of surgery and considered a good
candidate for transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. His temporary cardiac
pacing wires and chest drainage tubes and a Jackson-Pratt drain
were all discontinued on postoperative day #2. On the Step-Down
Unit , he was noted to have a high white blood cell count of
approximately 17 in the immediate perioperative period , however
the white blood cell count had improved markedly to 11.9 by
postoperative day #3. He had a PA and lateral chest x-ray on
postoperative day #3 , which revealed satisfactory postoperative
appearance of the chest. The patient was ambulating and
tolerating a full diet without difficulty and is now considered
in good candidate for discharge to home with visiting nurse
services on 1/8/06 , postoperative day #4.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Medications at the time of discharge
include aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily ,
diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. as needed
for constipation , Zetia 10 mg p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o.
daily , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily x5 days , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily x5
days , metformin 500 mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily ,
and oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4 h. as needed for pain.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is instructed to make and
keep all of his follow-up appointments and shower and wash his
wounds with soap and water each day. He is to continue diuresis
with Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily for five days and then discontinue
until his re-evaluation at a follow-up appointment with his PCP
or cardiologist and 1-2 weeks. Of note , this patient was
diagnosed for the first time as a type II diabetic during this
admission with a hemoglobin A1c of 7.2 prior to admission. He
was followed by the Diabetes Management Service postoperatively ,
and was started on metformin 500 mg a day and should follow up
with his primary care physician in 1-2 weeks for follow-up check
of his blood sugar and any necessary adjustment in his diabetic
medications. He is instructed to make follow-up appointments
with his cardiac surgeon Dr. Jakowich for two weeks following
discharge from the hospital and to return to see his primary care
physician , Dr. Parmalee one to two weeks following discharge from
the hospital.

Discharge Date: 2/24/1993
Bipids SERVICE
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PRESYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56 year old black female
with coronary artery disease ,
status post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery
bypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into
the hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a
racing heart. Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had her
first myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in
1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her
LIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to
her obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary artery
bypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable
since that time without angina or congestive heart failure
symptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerance
test one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedly
normal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racing
heart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died two
years ago.
On the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,
nonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained until
the patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which was
approximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never with
this pain before the day of admission. In additional , as the
patient was walking down the street near her home on the morning of
the day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the world
seemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutes
until the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did not
change in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortness
of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,
trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanying
racing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patient
drove herself to the Georgeb.sonhan Hospital Emergency Ward
for evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.
She has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest of
her review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft
in 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She has
had hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in 3/27 showed
left ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateral
hypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: To
Penicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-year
history of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drink
alcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as an
unemployed LPN , and has one child.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a well developed well nourished
black female very anxious and teary eyed.
Blood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95
in the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at
98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skin
was warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT exam
was benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venous
distention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. The
lungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angle
tenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regular
rate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolic
murmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI was
diffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with a
bruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. The
rest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruits
were heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,
and her exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Her
hematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , low
MCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with normal CK&apos;s. Her chest x-ray showed a
globular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post
coronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had right
atrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no
evidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonary
edema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS
.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateral
T-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. The
patient had no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Involved placing the patient on a cardiac
monitor , rule her out for an myocardial
infarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawing
blood for thyroid function tests , VMA&apos;s , metanephrines in the
urine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive
regimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiac
monitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC&apos;s. The
results of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress test
showed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard
Bruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.
EKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It was
reportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Because
of this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on the
outside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,
2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no
tumor or thrombus was detected.
Laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated protein
of 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgG
and IgM&apos;s were sent and were pending on discharge.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. ,
Cardizem 60 mg q.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , and an
Aspirin a day. The patient was discharged to home in very stable
condition and will followup in REUM WILSHIP MEMORIAL HOSPITAL on 8/28/93 at 1:30. A copy of
this discharge should be sent to Dr. Mccrane , telephone number
026-6050 , who is her primary medical doctor. During her stay here ,
we were not able to get hold of him and notify him of the patient&apos;s
status.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Stroke.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Type II diabetes mellitus. 6. Gastroesophageal reflux
disease.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS: The patient had a head MRI ,
an echocardiogram , and head
CT scan.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 61-year-old male was in his usual
state of health until the morning of
admission when he woke up with speech difficulty noticed by his
wife. The patient was noted to make paraphasic errors. In
addition , there was a question of a right facial droop. The
patient presented to the emergency room. There were no other
neurologic symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission revealed
pulse 78 , temperature 98.8 , and blood
pressure 160/78. The patient was in no apparent distress. The
head and neck examination was unremarkable. The neck was supple.
The thyroid gland was not enlarged. The lungs were clear. There
was a normal S1 and S2 , with no murmurs , gallops or rubs. The
abdomen was soft and non-tender. There was no peripheral edema.
The patient was alert and oriented to his name and to place. The
patient had difficulty giving the exact date and month. The
patient was unable to register three objects properly. The
patient&apos;s speech was non-fluent with impaired naming. Repetition
was also affected. There was right left confusion , severe
acalculia , as well as poor reading and writing. The patient had no
neglect or apraxia. The patient was able to copy a complicated
figure without problems. The cranial nerves were intact , except
for a mild right upper motor neuron facial palsy. There was no
pronator drift and the strength was 5/5 in all four extremities.
Sensation was intact to primal modalities. The reflexes were 2+
and symmetric with downgoing toes. The patient had normal gait.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed serum
electrolytes to be normal , except for a potassium
of 5.3. The glucose was 168. The white count was 7.8 , hematocrit
38.8 , and platelets 223. A PT and PTT were normal. A head CT scan
showed a subtle hyperdensity in the left frontal region. This was
later confirmed by MRI. The patient had carotid ultrasounds , which
showed a 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The
right internal carotid was stenosed to 25%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital with a
diagnosis of probable embolic stroke. An MRI
showed a wedge shaped frontal lobe infarct. Clinically , the

24 hours. The patient&apos;s naming was relatively preserved.
Comprehension was intact for simple commands. However , the patient
continued to have right left indiscrimination , acalculia , as well
as a defect in reading and writing. The patient was initially
unable to add two plus two , but by the end of the hospitalization ,
he was able to add nine plus six. However , the patient&apos;s
calculation never returned to his baseline function. The patient
had an echocardiogram , which revealed an ejection fraction of 60% ,
with no significant valvular disease. There was no thrombus noted
in the left atrium. The patient was started on intravenous Heparin
on admission , and was then converted to oral Coumadin. The patient
ruled out for myocardial infarction on admission. The patient was
kept on a cardiac monitor with no cardiac events noted. The

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
**CC:falling episodes
**HPI: 64 yo M s/p head assault-blunt trauma ( L crown ) 1/9 w/ possible
LOC. Reports frequent falling , n/v , with one ED visit in 4/20 , neg eval
by neuro. No prodrome , assoc w weakness , no CP , no palpitations , no
jerking movements , no incontinence. C/o h/a almost daily for last 3
wks , mostly on L side to post.+ blurry vision.
**PE on discharge: afeb , 80 , 120/70 , not orthostatic. RR 14 , 94-97% RA.
Surgical R pupil. No JVD. RRR S1S2 , III/VI cres/decres ejection murmur at
RUSB. CTAB. +BS , soft NTND. No edema. +gait imbalance.
**Studies: CXR-negative , Head CT-negative. Echo-EF 65-70% , + mild to
moder AS , valve area 1.4 , mean aortic vavle gradient 47. EKG NSR @ 70bpm ,
nml axis/intervals , on ST changes.
**Consults: Neuro ( Dr. Guttierrez ) , Psych ( Dr. Jarocki ) ,
**Hosp Course by System:
1 ) Cards: Ischemia: Low suspicion for ACS given sxs , however ruled out
for ACS. Pump: Pt with low SBPs on admission in 80s-90s , increased to
120s-130s with hydration. B-blockers , nitrates , ACE-I held on admission
given low BPs. Low dose B-blocker restarted HD 3. ACE-I restarted at
half dose on HD4 given pt&apos;s renal dysfunction/hypotension on admission.
Can be uptitrated as outpt. Will continue to hold nitrate for now , may be
restarted by PCP if needed; as currently with SBPs in 120s-130s do not
think pt will tolerate right now. TTE results as described above. Mild to
moderate AS , no indication for surgical correction , very unlikely to be
cause of pt&apos;s falling episodes. Pt to follow up with outpt cardiologist.
Rythym: Monitored on telemetry throughout hospitalization. On HD 4 , pt had
short run of NSVT ( 9 beats ) with associated chest tightness lasting for a
few seconds. His vital signs remained stable at this time and an EKG taken
immediately after showed NSR at 67 beats per minute with no changes
from previous ekg&apos;s. Given that he was largely asymptomatic with stable
vital signs , has normal EF , his Magnesium was repleted and he will follow
up with his outpt. cardiologist.
2 ) Pulm: On admission pt had roncherous lung exam with normal chest
X-ray. Improvd after neb treatment. O2sats mid to high 90s on RA , with
no O2 requirement during hospitalization.
3 ) Renal: Admitted with Cr of 2.4 , decreased to 1.1 on HD 2 after
hydration. FeNa on admission &lt;1% suggesting pre-renal etiology. Held pt&apos;s
NSAIDs given renal failure on admission.
4 ) Neuro: Pt has clear gait instability. Had work-up in January 2005
including MRI/MRA head , neck which were negative. Pt was re-evaluated by
Neurology who felt sxs not indicative of cerebellar disease , felt
possibly post-concussive syndrome. To follow up with outpt Neurologist.
RPR negative. Utox/serum tox negative.
5 ) Heme: Hct 33 ( around baseline ) , anemia work up negative , manual smear
normal. Guiaic negative. Should be followed as outpatient.
6 ) GU: Pt with hx of bladder neck stenosis. Evaluated by GU. No post void
residual , so only recs were follow up with outpt Urologist ( Dr. Georgevic )
in 1 month. With UTI , resistant to flouroquinolones. Being treated with
Nitrofurantion 100mg op bid x 2 weeks. To have repeat urine studies with
Dr. Sundahl 9/10 after tx.
7 ) Endo: Cortisol nml , TSH normal , covered with RISS.
8 ) GI: No emesis since admission. Tolerated regular diet well. LFTs nml ,
amylase sl incr , lipase nml.

refused until discussed with outpt psychiatrist. Attempted to contact
outpt MD without success. Pt unclear about exact benzo regimen , received
0.5mg alprazolam qid which may be slightly less than home regimen. No

We made the following changes to your medications:
1 ) Decreased Lisinopril in 1/2 ( decreased to 5mg )
2 ) Stopped Toprol and started Metoprolol - this is at a lower dose so your
blood pressure won&apos;t get so low.

Discharge Date: 7/18/1991
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 42-year-old woman
admitted for treatment of two pulmonary
embolisms and a urinary tract infection.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Pulmonary embolisms times two.
2. Urinary tract infection.
3. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy.
PRESENT ILLNESS: Twenty years ago the patient suffered a
pulmonary embolism which was poorly
documented after a tubal ligation. She was treated with heparin
and Coumadin. Since that time she has been well. On 21 of April
the patient underwent elective total abdominal hysterectomy
secondary to fibroids and menorrhagia. On 22 of May , the night
before discharge , the patient noted the onset of sharp pleuritic
chest pain upon movement in bed. It was felt this was musculo-
skeletal and she was discharged. While at home before admission ,
the patient noted some shortness of breath and a temperature to
101. She continued to have a pleuritic chest pain and came to
the emergency room. She was admitted on 17 of November
Past medical history: ( 1 ) Pulmonary embolism. ( 2 ) Cholecys-
tectomy. ( 3 ) Costochondritis. ( 4 ) Status post TAH for
fibroids. ( 5 ) Asthma.
The patient&apos;s family history is notable for a cousin with lupus.
The patient doesn&apos;t smoke. The patient drinks occasionally.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese women who
appeared tired and was having some
discomfort breathing. Her temperature in the emergency room was
102.5. Her blood pressure was 110/80. Heart rate was 120.
Respirations were 32 which went down to 24 as she calmed down.
Her O2 saturation on room air was 99%. An ABG was not done. Head
was unremarkable. Neck was supple. Lungs were clear without a
rub. Cardiac exam shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs
appreciated. Abdomen was soft and has bowel sounds. The wound
had its dressing in place and there was a small amount of
serosanguinous drainage appreciated. It was nontender.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits.
BUN 6 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 114 ,
white count 12.2 , hematocrit 26 , platelets 508 , 000. PT 13.4 , PTT
25.6. Chest x-ray showed bilateral basilar atelectasis. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia at 104 with normal interval and axis.
There was T-wave inversion in 3 and V1 without other ST-T wave
changes. VQ scan obtained prior to admission was read as low
probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on
heparin. The PTT was quickly thera-
peutic. The patient had informal noninvasive studies , mainly
ultrasound of the thighs which failed to show deep venous
thrombosis. She , therefore , underwent on the second hospital day
pulmonary angiography which showed two small pulmonary embolisms
on the left side. In the meantime , her VQ scan had been reinter-
preted as showing intermediate probability with notch defect on
left and right. The patient had been started on Coumadin.
In the meantime , after her procedure she developed a procedure.
She had some dysuria. Her urine had white cells and bacteria and
eventually grew out Enterobacter aerogenes. In the meantime she
was treated with ceftizoxime and defervesced and was converted to
p.o. Bactrim and remained afebrile. The Enterobacter was sensi-
tive to this antibiotic. The patient was discharged on 1 mg
p.o. q. h.s. of Coumadin with a PT the preceding day of 19.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient&apos;s condition is good.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to the
Critmi Ganstown Community Medical Center under the care of
Dr. Jamie Perman who is the patient&apos;s primary care physician.
A PT will need to be checked on arrival. Most likely the
patient&apos;s PT will be in the range of 18 to 20 and she will need
approximately 1 mg p.o. of Coumadin.
Discharge medications: Bactrim one double strength tablet p.o.
b.i.d.; iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d.; Motrin 800 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q. h.s.

plaques. Neuro: Cranial nerves II through XII intact. Range of
motion on lower extremities is limited by pain.
LABS ON ADMISSION: 27.6 white count and 32.1 hematocrit.
Glucose of 57. Blood smear showed 1+ target cells , ____ , and
tear drops.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted to the floor.
1. ID. She was initiated on cefuroxime q.12h. , levofloxacin ,
and Flagyl. Urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 yeast ,
likely explained by persistent Foley catheter and perineal yeast
infection. Her Foley was changed upon admission to the floor.
Blood culture was negative as was the stool culture. The patient
continued to be febrile and had elevated white count despite
antibiotic therapy without fevers , so the antimicrobial therapy
was discontinued on hospital day #3. Evaluation by the
Infectious Disease team with further studies did not yield a
clear source of infection. Therefore , Rheumatology consult was
called.
2. Rheumatology: Evaluation by the Rheumatology Service lead to
joint aspirations performed in the right MCP and right knee
joints , which revealed fluid with around 2000 white blood cells
and both negatively by refringent and positively by refringent
crystals consistent with gout and pseudogout. DVT was ruled out
as a cause of this extremity swelling. The patient was started
on Colchicine with improvement of pain and decrease of joint
swelling. An intraarticular ankle injection of Depo-Medrol was
performed on 7/9/05 with good affect. By the 6/13/05 , the
patient reported marked improvement in her range of motion and
pain control.
3. Endocrine: The patient was initially maintained on her rehab
dose of insulin which was Lantus 18 units at night , aspart 4
units at meals plus a sliding scale of Novolog. However , due to
intermittent decreased p.o. intake , she suffered several episodes
of hypoglycemia with blood sugars in the 30s to 50s. Her insulin
dosing was titrated initially downward and then after she
increased her p.o. intake it was titrated upwards. Pancreatic
enzymes were given with meals.
4. Cardiovascular: Ms. Warner Welman blood pressure was persistently
elevated on her rehab regimen of antihypotensive medication.
Control was achieved in house by titrating her metoprolol up to
75 mg q.i.d. and adding Captopril at 50 mg t.i.d. No hypotension
while in house.
5. Neurologic: Her mental status initially declined at the
beginning of hospitalization. But by hospital day #3 , she began
to improve and became more coherent and alert. Her pain was
controlled on admission as well by both oxycodone and colchicine.
CT myelography was performed on 6/13/05 to evaluate the
patient&apos;s spinal stenosis disease. Results are still pending at
the time of this dictation.
6. Renal: Her electrolytes and renal functions were followed
closely in the setting of a recent urosepsis during the last
admission , her creatinine remained less than 1.2 throughout her
hospitalization and her electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
Urine output remained sufficient.
PLAN: Plan was for discharge in stable condition to Riseborgess Health with instructions to follow up her PCP , Aurelio Mahnken , in one
to two weeks after discharge.
CODE STATUS: Full.
Daughter is her health care proxy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Will be dictated at the time of
discharge.

Discharge Date: 5/16/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a vigorous , healthy
79-year-old retired garment industry
worker followed by Dr. Aurelio Kiper at Erffor Hospital
for the question of transient ischemic attacks but is otherwise
well. On the night of admission , the patient and his wife noted
fatigue , lightheadedness and diaphoresis three different times
during the day. The patient took one to two ounces of ethanol to
relieve this discomfort. Several hours later , attempting to climb
stairs , the patient fell and was unable to get up. Soon after , he
had an episode of melenic soft stool in large volume without frank
blood and then a moderate amount of coffee ground emesis. The
emergency medical technicians were called. In the ambulance , Mr.
Jirak heart rate was 110 with a blood pressure of 110/68. At the
Ty Hospital Emergency Ward , his blood pressure had dropped to
95/60 and he was symptomatically orthostatic.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) was performed in the Emergency
Room which showed an actively bleeding 1 cm antral lesion in the
greater curvature of the stomach which was cauterized. This was
felt to be consistent with a pancreatic rest versus leiomyoma
versus rarely metastatic lesion as well as some mild esophagitis.
Mr. Audie had no previous history of peptic ulcer disease. He has
been taking aspirin , one to two per day for several months because
of a question of TIA and for hip pain. He does have a history of
daily ethanol use , approximately two to three ounces per day times
many years. There was no history of nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
weight loss , abdominal pain , anorexia , or other constitutional
symptoms. There was a remote history of abdominal pain and spastic
colon with a negative barium enema , upper GI series and abdominal
ultrasound in 1976. He was admitted to the Cussceo Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was transfused with 5
units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and vital signs
stabilized. He was then transferred to the General Medical Service
with a stable hematocrit at 37. It had been as low as 21 in the
MICU. MEDICATIONS: On admission included aspirin , two po q day
and steroid cream to the psoriatic area. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Noteable for chronic psoriasis. Vertigo with question of TIA.
Status post multiple excisions of basal cell skin carcinoma.
History of hiatal hernia with a question of reflux esophagitis.
Status post suprapubic prostatectomy many years ago because of BPH.
Status post herniorrhaphy. Status post appendectomy. History of
glucose intolerance , diet controlled. Status post right cataract
removal with lens implantation. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN MEDICAL
ALLERGIES. FAMILY HISTORY: Multiple siblings healthy in their
late 80&apos;s. Positive family history of pancreatic CA in brother.
History of hypertension in mother and sister. No history of
coronary artery disease , diabetes , tuberculosis , hepatic or renal
disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired womens clothing
manufacturer. He lives with his wife in Muldsc Ln , Hou He has a moderate
ethanol use and has not used tobacco for 30 years. REVIEW OF
SYSTEMS: Negative except for vertigo.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: After stabilization revealed a 79-year-old
looking remarkably well and fit. Vital
signs revealed a heart rate of 60 , blood pressure 132/70.
Temperature 98. Skin revealed multiple patches of psoriasis. Head
and neck revealed normal pupils. Extraocular movements were intact
except for slight decrease in upward gaze mobility. The oropharynx
was benign. Neck was normal. Chest was clear. Cardiac
examination revealed S4 , S1 , S2 , no S3. A slow murmur heard on
admission was absent after transfusion. Abdomen was soft , flat
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities revealed pulses to be
intact without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Stool was positive.
Neurological exam was grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant data included as mentioned , the
hematocrit down to 21 which became stable at 37.
There was also evidence of mild pyuria and hematuria. Otherwise ,
some mild elevations of liver enzymes were noted toward the end of
his hospitalization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent the following studies
including a repeat EGD which showed in the antrum
a 1 cm area along the greater curvature which was ulcerated with
raised borders. Biopsies were not taken of that lesions , however ,
biopsies of large folds distal to the antrum in the duodenum were
biopsied. The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan which showed
question of small cystic lesion in the pancreas , either ductal
dilatation or a cyst but almost certainly an incidental finding
without any evidence of intraabdominal malignancy. Upper GI series
performed on the following day again showed thickened gastric folds
but was unremarkable. The patient was discharged on 4/25/90 on the
following medications: Pepcid , 20 mg po b.i.d.; steroid cream for
psoriasis. Follow-up will be arranged with Dr. Melino and Dr.
Collom The patient was in stable condition upon discharge.

Discharge Date: 11/8/2005
ATTENDING: MEADERS , DONNY MD
CONSULTS: Consults for this patient included Urology and
Cardiology.
PROCEDURES: Procedures for this patient included a urological
procedure with placement of a ureteral stent and subsequent
removal of the ureteral stent.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission included Lasix 20 mg
b.i.d. , OxyContin 90 b.i.d. and 40 q. 2 p.m. , lisinopril 40
daily , Norvasc 5 b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 b.i.d. , Levoxyl 88 mcg ,
Ativan 0.5 at bedtime , Niferex 150 b.i.d. , Colace b.i.d. ,
lactulose 50 daily , Faslodex 250 IM q. month , Coumadin 5 daily ,
Zometa q. month , Fosamax 70 q. week , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies included penicillin , which resulted in
pruritus and a rash.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old woman with a
history of rheumatic heart disease , status post St. Jude&apos;s mitral
valve repair as well as AV and TV repair who has CHF at baseline
with an EF of 40% to 45% as well as metastatic breast cancer and
a recent history of hydronephrosis who initially presented with
chest discomfort with exertion that resolved with rest. The
chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is
described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and
shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the
pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. She also said that she
had PND and orthopnea at baseline and she had recently increased
her number of pillows that she sleeps on , from two to three. Her
weight had been stable with no change in diet. She ruled out for
an MI; however , given her hydronephrosis , thought to be secondary
to her metastatic cancer and her rise in creatinine , it was
decided to place a ureteral stent , which was done by the Urology
Service. However , after the stent was placed , she developed
severe pain , fever , and increased white blood cell count.
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she
continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral
stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable
for a blood pressure of 168/94. Other vitals included a
temperature 97.2 , pulse 69 , respiratory rate 16 , and saturating
98% on room air. Her JVP was 9. She had left lower lung
crackles , otherwise clear. She has a very loud ejection murmur ,
loud S1 and S2. She was in atrial fibrillation with a
irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to
2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive.
PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM:
Heart: Ischemia: She had a negative MIBI and her A and B sets
of troponins were negative , however her C set was 0.14 , which was
thought to be an error. Her aspirin and statin were continued.
Pump: Her EF was 35% to 40%. She was kept on hydralazine ,
Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to
bradycardia during this admission. In terms of her valves , she
has a St. Jude valve as well as other valve abnormalities and her
INR goal was 2 to 3. She was taken off her Coumadin for her
stent procedure and then bridged with heparin for a PTT goal of
60 to85. Her Coumadin was restarted and we waited until she was
therapeutic at an INR above 2 before she was discharged. Rate:
She is normally in atrial fibrillation. She developed
bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a
combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was
having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of
digoxin. Her dioxin was stopped. Her beta-blocker was stopped
and then restarted at a lower dose. By discharge , she was
tolerating low-dose Lopressor. During the hospital stay , on
2/29/05 she had 10 beats of VT during which she was
asymptomatic. Her blood pressure was stable.
Renal: She had acute renal failure on admission and as I had
dictated previously she had a ureteral stent placed on 2/29/05
and that was then removed on 2/24/05 because of her severe pain.
Endocrine: She was kept on her Levoxyl.
Heme: She was guaiac positive , and her stools were guaiaced and
her hematocrit was monitored. Although it dropped initially , it
did not drop further during the hospital stay. She was kept on
her home pain control medications and she required additional
pain medications when she had her stent placed.
Psych: She continued her home medications.
GI: She stayed on her lactulose and Colace and bowel regimen was
titrated to bout BM&apos;s.
DISPOSITION: She was stable on the day of discharge. She was
discharged to home , I believe , with VNA.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her medications on the day of discharge
were Coumadin 6 q.p.m. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20
in the morning and 40 at night , Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. , Aranesp
100 subcutaneous q. week , OxyContin 90 q. 12h. and 40 q. 2.p.m. ,
Nexium 40 daily , Zocor 20 mg at bedtime , aspirin 81 , Colace 100 ,
Niferex 150 , Levoxyl 88 , Senna daily , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
FOLLOWUP: She was instructed to follow up with her PCP.

ATTENDING: KESSLER , NICKOLAS M.D.
HOSPITAL COURSE: For the events of the earlier part of the
hospitalization , please see the dictation by the Vascular Surgery
team. The patient was transferred to the Medical Service for
further management on 3/7/07. Briefly , this is a 59-year-old
female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
history of recurrent MRSA infections including vertebral osteo
status post compression fracture and fusion admitted to Therm Clinic on 10/6/07 from rehab after rupture of her
right forearm AV fistula. The patient underwent surgical
ligation of her brachial artery. The patient had a significant
drop in her hematocrit to 14 , and she received several units of
packed red blood cells and underwent surgical ligation of the
brachial artery. She subsequently remained intubated on Levophed
in the Surgical ICU. She was then weaned off Levophed and
transferred to the Surgery Service. The patient completed a
course of linezolid for treatment of her recent bacteremia , which
ended on 9/11/07. She was started on fluconazole 400 mg once
daily for treatment of recent candidemia , course ending 10/2/07 ,
and she was also started on vancomycin 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
ongoing suppressive treatment of recurrent C. diff. The
patient&apos;s hospital course was subsequently complicated by severe
deconditioning , refeeding syndrome , poor nutritional status and
decubitus ulcers.

HOSPITAL COURSE: A 59-year-old female with diabetes , end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis , history of recurrent infections
including MRSA vertebral osteo , bacteremia in 1/24 and
gram-negative rod sepsis in 10/6 with T5-6 osteo and cord
compression status post fusion in 10/6 admitted on 10/6/07 for
AV fistula rupture and bleed now status post brachial artery
ligation.
Hospital course complicated by severe deconditioning , poor
nutritional status and decubitus ulcers.
1. Infectious disease: The patient started to become afebrile
48 hours after transfer to the Medical Service with temperatures
as high as 102.5. Vital signs were stable. Blood cultures are
still no growth to date. Chest x-ray without any evidence of
infiltrate. The patient is anuric , likely source decubitus
ulcers versus recurrent osteo. Blood cultures were obtained on a
daily basis , which were no growth today at the time of this
dictation. Fluconazole and vancomycin p.o. were continued ,
course ending on 2/10/07. The ID. Service was asked to consult
for further help with management of the patient&apos;s fevers.
Plastics consult was obtained to evaluate decubitus ulcers.
.
2. Renal: The patient was followed by Renal Service and had
dialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays.
3. GI: The patient was maintained on Reglan for gastroparesis
and continued on Nexium.
4. Heme: The patient had guaiac-positive stools. Her
hematocrit was 28 and dropped to 25.8 upon transfer. She
received two units of packed red blood cells transfusion on
3/26/07 during dialysis.
5. Endocrine: The patient had uncontrolled hyperglycemia likely
secondary to the stress of her hospitalization. She was
initially on 40 units of NPH b.i.d. and this was titrated up to
maintain normal glycemia.
6. Derm: She had decubitus ulcers followed by the wound care
nurse , Vicente Desai She was continued on Panafil and XenoDerm.
A Plastics consult was obtained regarding need for further
debridement.
7. FEN: The patient&apos;s course was complicated by refeeding
syndrome with severe electrolyte imbalances requiring aggressive
repletion of her electrolytes including phos , K and mag. She was
maintained on tube feeds. A Speech and Swallow evaluation was
obtained , which determined that she can be started on pureed
diet. However , it was unlikely that she would be able to
maintain adequate p.o. intake.
8. Prophylaxis The patient was maintained on heparin prophylaxis
for DVT and Nexium given her guaiac-positive stools.
At time of this dictation , the plan is for a family meeting to
discuss the patient&apos;s prognosis , nutritional status and goals of
care.

ATTENDING: DRISCOLL , ELDEN MD
SERVICE:
GMS Katena Highway
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Chet Nerpio , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
End-stage renal disease and osteomyelitis.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , peripheral neuropathy , left
Charcot foot complicated by ulceration requiring partial
thickness debridement on 3/26/06 in the setting of new Aircast
started on 8/21/06 now with a cast applied to the left foot ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia , spinal
stenosis , anemia of chronic disease , thrombocytopenia , and ascus
6/10 and 11/6
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with chronic renal
insufficiency , baseline creatinine 3.8 , diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , and anemia , who present with two weeks of diffuse
abdominal pain that acutely worsened one day prior to admission
with associated nausea , nonbloody emesis , and chills. The
patient was found to be febrile with leukocytosis in the ED. The
patient had been seen previously in the ED on 10/11/06 at which
time she was treated with a UTI. She was sent home with a
seven-day course of ciprofloxacin and oxycodone for pain. The
ciprofloxacin was renally dosed. The patient reports that she
stopped taking oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. After developing
constipation , it is unclear if she completed her full course of
antibiotics. She currently present with complaints of diarrhea
in the setting of having taken laxative at home. No melena or
hematochezia. The pain is not related to food , urination , or
defecation. She has poor p.o. intake , denies any sick contacts
at home. No recent travel.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Positive for blood sugars ranging from 180-190 , although she had
a blood sugar of 499 on the morning of admission. She has
fatigue but no myalgias , no cough , chest pain , shortness of
breath , no dysuria. In the ED , she was given ampicillin 2 g IV ,
gentamicin 80 mg IV , Flagyl 500 mg IV and 8 units of insulin.
ALLERGIES:
Medication reaction , she has an allergy to lisinopril with
reaction of elevated creatinine at a low dose. To levofloxacin ,
she has reflux and celecoxib gives her dizziness and elevated
creatinine.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She had a temperature of 101 , pulse of 106 , blood pressure
172/71 , oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was alert and
oriented x3 , in mild distress. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. She was obese , but had a nontender , nondistended abdomen
with normal abdominal bowel sounds. She was guaiac negative , and
her left foot was in a cast.
PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND RESULTS:
She had a sodium of 127 , corrected to 131 with her glucose ,
potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 27 , BUN 95 , creatinine 4.5 ,
glucose 329. LFTs were normal , amylase 19 , lipase 8 , negative
keto acids in the serum and urine. Her white blood count was
26.8 , INR was 1.4 , PTT was 36.6. She had a dirty urinalysis.
She had an abdominal CT that showed a non-incarcerated hernia , no
evidence of colitis.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06. She
also had hemodialysis initiated on 10/9/06.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious disease: The patient&apos;s left foot was encasted by
orthopedics surgery on 2/29/06 with evidence of underlying
infection. Her wound cultures grew MRSA with probes to the bone.
X-rays were unrevealing and MRI showed severe osteomyelitis. In
addition , the patient had an ESR of 109. The patient was thus
put on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl. Blood cultures from
6/16/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters which
eventually yielded MRSA. However , surveillance cultures with
treatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl were negative.
The patient received debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06.
In the OR , the bone looked necrotic and infected. The bone was
sent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which are
pending. Given the appearance of her bone during debridement , it
is presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.
Because she did have a clear source of fevers after it was found
that she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued off
Flagyl and levofloxacin on 5/6/06.
2. GI: The patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptying
study on 6/16/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistent
with severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. Radiology did not
feel that an upper GI series would give further information
regarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given that
the patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. Later on in the
hospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with a
decrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.
The patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on MRA.
Later , erythromycin was changed to Reglan on 4/8/06 per renal
request during hemodialysis. There is no evidence of pancreatis
or liver disease and the patient was also kept on Compazine for
nausea.
3. Renal: The patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renal
failure. There was a concern for prerenal azotemia in the
setting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. She had a
fractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it was
difficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.
Lasix and Cozaar were held. However , the creatinine continued
to worsen reaching 6.1 on 9/14/06. Renal was consulted
regarding the need for dialysis. On admission , the patient did
have matured AV fistula graft and she was thus started on
hemodialysis on 10/9/06.
4. Hematology: The patient had an INR which was elevated.
Hematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. She was guaiac
negative and did have any schistocyte. Her LDH was also normal
with her haptoglobin high. It was judged from her iron studies
that the patient was iron deficient. She was put on iron
supplementation. She also was felt to have renal component to
her anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially and
changed to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.
5. Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on aspirin , a
statin , and calcium channel blocker. She started prophylactic
beta-blocker during her hospital course as well.
6. Endocrine: The patient had hemoglobin A1c of 7.8. She was
transitioned to NPH and Aspart during her hospital stay. She had
intermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of being
NPO pending operations and procedures; however , her insulin
regimen was titrated to good glycemic response.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on heparin and Nexium.
8. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: Her IV fluids were
stopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially before
hemodialysis. Later on , she was also put on 1500 mL fluid
restriction. Later on during dialysis , her volume status
resolved euvolemia. She was kept on a low fat and low
cholesterol diabetic diet. The patient is full code.

1.2-1.3 ). HCT 41.6 with drop after aggresive hydration. Lipase of 132
but has chronic pancreatitis and is now normalizing. UA and ACE
negative.
ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 YO male with complicated PMH admitted with
hyperglycemia likely due to non-compliance and hypotension likely due
to hypovolemia. In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U of
insulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he was
transfered to the medical floor.
ENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more like
type 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20
units of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with both
diet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patient
was started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He was
titrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FS
ranging from 120-600. By 8/22 his FS remained better controlled but
were still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On 3/22 the
patient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged o
n Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. He
was maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern he
may have been eating sweets on his own. Nutrition was consulted
and provided teaching regaring diet and diabetes. The patient is
discharged to home on Lantus and lispro with VNA following
HEME - on coumadin for hx of pacer clot. Echo shows pacer clot but
not clear whether patient will be compliant enough to go home on
coumadin as he has not been in the past. After discussion with
patient agreement is that we will d/c on coumadin 5 QD ( INR on
day of d/c 1.2 ) with enough supply for one week. He will have
blood drawn by VNA with results sent to Dr. Zarkin If he his not
compliant with his lab work the coumadin will be stopped.
CV -
ISCHEMIA: Nonobstuctive CAD on cath in September with no evidence
of acute episode. Maintained on ASA , ACEi , and Statin. No BB as
current cocaine user and considered to dangerous
PUMP: EF: 20-25% Hypovolemic at admission with good response to
hydration. No episodes of volume overload. On ACEi for AL reduction.
RHYTHM: CHB with PPM in place
GI: elevated lipase with chronic pancreatitis with no symptoms and
resolution after hydration.
DISPO: The patient is discharged to home in fair condition. He has been
given teaching regarding nutrition , diabetes , and coumadin. His
medications has been discussed with him. He agrees to be compliant with
all medications , to work with VNA , and to attend all of his
appointments and blood draws. He is discharged home on coumadin and
Lantus to be followed by VNA. He is to follow up with Dr. Harnage within
the next week and will be contacted with an appointment

Hospital Course
Pt was admitted for observation and ROMI with stress test. There was low
suspicion for ACS given her history. However , pt with multiple CRF and
felt that inpatient stress was warranted ( last MIBI 2002 ).
Pt underwent chemical-MIBI on 9/19 ( hx of PVD can only walk 2 block
equivalent ) that was negative for any acute , reversible changes ( final
P ).
Unclear etiology for her pain. The diagnosis of potential pericarditis
was entertained , but again , the history was not consistent , no viral
prodome , no EKG changes , no pulsus/rub appreciated. No reproducible/MSK
pain.
Her pain was only controlled with oxycodone. She was pain-free at
discharge.Pt was continued on all her outpatient medications. no changes.

Discharge Date: 4/4/2005
ATTENDING: BOGGIANO , COLUMBUS WILTON MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Ventricular fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Forbess is a 75-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% status post ICD
and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis who was
admitted on July , 2005 after his ICD fired at home for
ventricular fibrillation. He notes a productive cough , a
subjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. He was
subsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. He had a low
grade fever of 100.0 at that time. He was electively admitted
but on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. He was given
lidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun on
amiodarone. The patient then became short of breath and was in
pulmonary edema , requiring intubation. Chest x-ray showed a
right upper lobe white out. The patient was taken to Cath for
possible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation.
He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion which
were both stented with Seifer stents. He also had a 60% D1
lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. He also
had a 70% left circumflex lesion. After catheterization , the
patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He was
continued on his amiodarone load. He had no further arrhythmias
during his ICU stay. He was extubated the following day and was
diuresed for congestive heart failure. He also began treatment
for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on May ,
2005.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , status
post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , and
hypothyroidism.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Lasix.
3. Coumadin.
4. Lopressor.
5. Lorazepam.
6. Colace.
7. Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon transfer out of the Intensive Care
Unit , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 81 , blood pressure
108/74 , oxygen saturation of 84% on room air , and 97% on four
liters. JVP of 14 cm. Lungs with bibasilar rales. Cardiac exam
revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft with a
pulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with no
rebound or guarding. His extremities had trace pitting edema.
Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum above
the nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomal
pattern around to the right side of the back to the midline as
well as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm.
LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and a
negative troponin on the day of admission.
IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy
admitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology ,
though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiac
ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab and
had stents placed in the LAD with other residual disease
remaining. The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin ,
Plavix and a statin. The patient often refused to take the
statin , though this was recommended. He was also started on a
low dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused as
well. We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when the
patient is more stable. The patient continued to be diuresed
with Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home dose
of Lasix 80 mg daily. An echo during admission showed an EF of
15% with moderate aortic stenosis. For his episodes of
ventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodarone
load with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he should
be tapered to 40 mg per day. He has one day remaining of his
amiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on September , 2005. He was monitored on telemetry without significant
event. The patient should follow up with Dr. Kolopajlo in
Electrophysiology Clinic.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for both
community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with
cefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. The patient completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. He is still in the process of
completing a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. He
has one more day of therapy remaining. The patient was also
noted to have shingles. The patient reports experiencing pain
that started on his back before the rash appeared. The rash was
present prior to admission. He was started on acyclovir on May , 2005 and this was stopped on November , 2005 given that there
was likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48
hours into the course and because the patient preferred not to
take the medication.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5. Creatinine was initially elevated to
2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was on
no medications as an outpatient. He received a diabetic diet and
was treated with a regular insulin sliding scale during
admission. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemic
control. He was started on a low dose of glipizide and the
regular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. The patient also
has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH was checked and was 1.6 ,
which is within normal limits. The patient was also noted to
have a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient.
We have started supplementation of vitamin D.
5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation
and low ejection fraction. The patient&apos;s Coumadin was initially
held but then restarted on October , 2005. He is now
therapeutic. Goal INR is 2-3. He will need to be monitored and
Coumadin adjusted as needed. The patient also has iron
deficiency anemia. He will need GI evaluation in the future. He
was begun on iron supplementation , however , the patient
frequently refuses to take this medication.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin.
7. Code status: The patient is full code.
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. Please
adjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3.

Discharge Date: 7/29/2000
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 33 year-old woman
with diet controlled diabetes
mellitus , morbid obesity , who presents to the emergency department
with periumbilical pain , radiating to the right lower quadrant. In
her first trip to the emergency department her pain was diffuse and
was thought to be gastroenteritis. After being sent home , she had
an increase in pain and vomiting and was unable to tolerate p.o. On
her second trip one day later she was vomiting with no fever but
chills and no flatus. The decision was made to take her to the
operating room to explore for appendicitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diet controlled.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.
MEDICATION: None.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a morbidly obese woman in
no acute distress. She was tachycardic.
Chest was clear. Abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds ,
tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant with positive psoas
and Rovsing&apos;s sign. Rectal examination showed normal tone and no
stool. Pelvic examination showed no cervical motion tenderness.
LABORATORY: Abdominal CT was obtained which showed 5x5 cm cecal
thickening with extraluminal air. This was thought to be consistent with a
perforated appendicitis or phlegmon. CBC showed a white blood
count 19 , 000. Her urine HCG was negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
May , by Dr. Jenovese , who initially opened the
right lower quadrant to explore for appendicitis. In exploring the
abdomen , purulent material was found in the right lower quadrant ,
and the appendix was not able to be visualized. The decision was
made to open the midline incision which was done. Details of the
operation may be found in Dr. Zinsli &apos;s operative report. By
report , she had gangrenous portions of the right colon ,
necessitating a right colectomy. This was performed , and she
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred extubated in
stable condition to the floor. Her immediate postoperative course
was complicated by supraventricular tachycardia to a rate of 200
with hypotension , requiring beta blockade and adenosine. She was
transferred to the Surgical ICU for further management. After the
use of beta blockade and adenosine , her arrhythmia resolved. This
was found to occur with magnesium of 1.5 which was repleted. Per
recommendations of the Cardiology Service , an echocardiogram was
obtained which was normal , and she ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial CKs and electrocardiograms. An NG tube was in
place which was continued on the first postoperative day , and she
was kept on Zantac. She was kept on ampicillin , levofloxacin and
Flagyl. A central line was in place. Over the next few
postoperative days , as her NG tube was removed and her diet slowly
advanced with sips , she was converted to p.o. medication. At one
point she developed a second episode of supraventricular
tachycardia and was thought to be either atrial fibrillation versus
sinus tachycardia. This did not respond immediately to Lopressor
and per Cardiology&apos;s recommendations , she was changed to diltiazem
followed by Diltiazem drip. When stabilized , her dose of Lopressor
was increased , Diltiazem stopped and she was converted to p.o.
Lopressor 50 t.i.d. which kept her in sinus rhythm and a stable
rate. By the third and fourth postoperative day , she was
tolerating a regular diet , passing flatus and bowel movements and
ambulating independently. She was weaned off her oxygen and her
central line was discontinued. She was stable for discharge.
The patient was discharged to home on August , 2000. At that time
she will have completed a 5-day course of ampicillin , levofloxacin
and Flagyl. She is tolerating a regular diet , ambulating
dependently and requiring minimal amounts of oral analgesics. She
received wet to dry dressing changes b.i.d. to her wounds , which
will need to be continued as an outpatient by a visiting nurse.
DISCHARGE MEDICATION: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet 1-2
tabs p.o. q 3-4 hours p.r.n. pain , Colace 100
mg b.i.d. while on Percocet.
FOLLOWUP: The patient is instructed to followup with Dr. Goan
in 1-2 weeks and should call his office for an
appointment.

spreading villous polyp involving the cecum and the ileocecal
valve. There were also aphthous erosions seen in the ileum and
the ascending colon , consistent with inflammatory bowel disease.
The patient recently had 20% of the polyp removed.
biopsy. The polyp pathology was low-grade dysplasia consistent
with a villoglandular polyp. The erosions were shown to be
chronic inflammation without evidence of dysplasia. The patient
presents on April , 2005 , to Gan Hospital for
laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy.

ATTENDING: STAIR , TRAVIS M.D.
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN: Rodney Fear , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Lower gastrointestinal bleed.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Endstage renal disease , hemodialysis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old male with endstage renal
disease , on hemodialysis and prior peptic
ulcer disease , who underwent EGD and colonoscopy four days prior to
arrival for evaluation of guaiac-positive stool. He underwent
polypectomy at that time without complication , but on the day of
admission noted bright red blood per rectum. Additionally he felt weak and
lightheaded and presented to the ED where his initial vital signs showed a
blood pressure 105/48 and heart rate of 60. He subsequently
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
Labs showed a hematocrit of 28 , down from a prior hematocrit of
43 in April . He was given a liter of IV fluids with moderate
improvement and was evaluated by the GI Service. GI at that time
felt the source was most likely secondary to the polypectomy
site. He was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring with a
planned colonoscopy the following day.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. End-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis with a history of
several failed grafts and shunts , currently using a left lower
extremity shunt.
2. Pelvic ulcer disease , status post partial gastrectomy with a
Billroth I in 1960 and upper GI bleed in 1996.

ALLERGIES: No known allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his cousin Hal Diza who is his
healthcare proxy.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Afebrile , heart rate 80 , blood pressure
127/64 , O2 saturation 100% on 2 liters , breathing 12 times a
minute , alert and oriented x2 in no acute distress. Neck:
Supple neck with a thyroidectomy scar. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm
without murmur , rubs or gallops. JVP 9. AV fistula in the
bilateral upper and lower extremities with no thrill or bruit.
Abdomen: Obese , soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel
sounds. Neurologic: Slow , responsive , but appropriate , moving
all extremities , ambulatory. Digital rectal examination positive
for blood.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 ,
BUN of 79 , creatinine of 10.3 , lactic acid 1.5 , WBCs of 5 ,
hematocrit of 28.7 , platelets of 162.
PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy with embolization of the ileocecal
artery on 1/6/2006 , repeat colonoscopy on 10/6/2006.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the MICU following presentation
to the emergency room with bright red blood per rectum and a
hematocrit of 28. Over the first couple of days in intensive
care , he received 8 to 9 units of packed red blood cells and On hospital day
#2 , he underwent an embolization of the ileocecal artery with subsequent
improvement in clinical picture. Over the next couple of days , he continued to
have
guaiac-positive and melena stools but with stabilization in his
hematocrit. A repeat colonoscopy was completed on 11/22/2006 ,
which showed a single white ulcer in the colon thought to be the
old polypectomy site but no signs of new or old blood.
Throughout the rest of his hospitalization , his hematocrit
remained stable and he was maintained on PPIs twice a day.
Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis three times a week. This was continued during his
hospitalization. He has had recurrent issues with AV fistula
failure. On admission , he was relying on the left lower
extremity shunt. There was a hardened area proximal to the shunt
found on physical exam and an absence of a thrill at
the site. Per Renal recommendation , this was evaluated
with an AV fistulogram and a subsequent ultrasound. The
ultrasound revealed that there was complex fluid collection
proximal to his AV graft. He was evaluated by Surgery who did
not feel further workup was indicated at this time. The patient
will be discharged to resume his routine renal regimen.
Psych: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and mild
mental retardation. We continued his outpatient psychiatric
medications. There were no acute issues.
Heme: The patient has a chronic anemia with a high MCV. Iron
studies suggest an anemia of chronic disease. He will be
discharged on his preadmission medications of B12 , folate and
iron once a day. His hematocrit has remained in the mid 30s.
Cardiovascular: There were no acute issues during his initial
hospitalization when he was hypotensive secondary to GI bleed.
His home beta-blocker was held. This was restarted prior to
discharge without incident. His Cardura was not restarted and
the patient did not become hypertensive. He will be discharged
without it. Additionally , we are holding his aspirin at
discharge until his followup primary care appointment.
Prophylaxis: pneumoboots; ambulation and
twice-a-day proton pump inhibitor.
FEN: Renal diet.
DISPOSITION: The patient was being discharged home. He was seen
and evaluated by Physical Therapy who felt that this would be a
safe disposition plan.
CODE: He was a full code.

Impression: demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoglycemia
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient had no recurrence of chest pain once she arrived on the
floor , or for that matter , SOB/N/V. She initally had difficulty
maintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 and
orange juice on the floor. After the first 12 hours , her blood sugars
have been consistently over 120. Although she was very enzyme posive
for NSTEMI ( MB 31.2--&gt;32.4--&gt;15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. IN
fact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. Therefore ,
her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia in
the context of hypoglycemia. Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypoth
yroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. Given the finite
duration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed most
likely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). The patient&apos;s cardiac enzymes have
peaked ( MB: 31.2--&gt;31.4--&gt; 15.4 ). The patient&apos;s home situation has been
previouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have been
dealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. This time , there was concern
over potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband or
medication errors. Social work was called and spoke with the daughter.
She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother&apos;s health
and open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility at
some later date. It is clear that an elaborate and effective system has
been worked out to monitor and treat the patient&apos;s blood sugars. The
patients visiting nurse service ( Lan Xiemore Medical Center ) was contacted to reemphasize
the importance of evaluating the patient&apos;s medication regimen. The
nurse involved in the patient&apos;s care also will initiate a request
for a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. Elder
services was informed to initiate a consult. The social worker at
Centter Ing Community Hospital was also informed of this admission. The
patient&apos;s home situation is deemed safe for discharge. She will
follow up with Dr. Fowlie on November VNA will visit her
tommorrow. The patient&apos;s hematocrit dropped slightly the day of dischar
ge. However , the patient was guaiac negative. Parenthetically , the
patient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. She was initially treated
but given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was too
low. Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call your
physician if they are consistently above 150. Your dose of lipitor has
been increased because your LDL on this admission was 92.

DIAGNOSIS: LEFT URETERAL STRICTURE.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: FLEXIBLE CYSTOSCOPY , LEFT EXTERNAL
URETERAL STENT PLACEMENT , REPAIR OF
LEFT DISTAL URETERAL STRICTURE
( BOARI FLAP ) BY DR. FANKHAUSER , ALLAN JAME
ON 9 of September INTERNALIZATION OF LEFT
STENT BY DR. SCHOCK , TOM GREGORY ON
12 of November
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old female
who underwent a left ureteral
lithotomy in 1985. She subsequently developed a left ureteral
stricture at the pelvic brim , which was balloon dilated in 18 of November
The patient received 2-1/2 years of relief , but the presented with
left flank pain and left hydronephrosis in 23 of September She had relief
with a left percutaneous nephrostomy , and later another balloon
dilatation. She had a third balloon dilatation in 7 of March , and this
was of a 4-centimeter segment. A stent was left in place. The
stent presently is within the ureter. The patient now presents for
the above-mentioned procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY was as above , plus thyroid cyst excision ,
liposuction of bilateral lower extremities , cholecystectomy ,
appendectomy , vein stripping , carpal tunnel release bilaterally ,
and tubal ligation. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Levothyroxine
0.025 milligrams 2 tablets per day , Motrin as needed , Tylenol as
needed , Percocet as needed. ALLERGIES included penicillin which
caused a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese female in no acute
distress. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat
examination was clear. Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Back has no costovertebral angle tenderness. Lungs were clear.
Heart had regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen was obese , soft ,
nondistended , nontender , good bowel sounds , multiple surgical scars
along the abdomen which were well-healed. Rectal examination
showed increased tone , tender secondary to hemorrhoid. Neurologic
examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , hematocrit was 29.7 ,
prothrombin time 11.8 , partial
thromboplastin time 21.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 25 of June , for a
procedure on 9 of September She underwent the
above-mentioned procedure without difficulty. The patient did lose
1 liter of blood , however , and received 2 units of autologous
packed red blood cells as well as 4 , 000 cc of lactated Ringer&apos;s and
2 , 000 cc of Hespan and 500 cc of albumin. In the operating room ,
they found the left distal ureteral stricture , approximately 8
centimeters with a small stone cluster. The patient left the
operating room in stable condition with a Foley to gravity , a
7-French single pigtail external ureteral stent , as well as a
Jackson-Pratt drain to suction. Postoperatively , the patient did
well. She did have a low hematocrit in the immediate postoperative
period requiring 2 units of blood. Her level was 21.9. Otherwise ,
electrolytes were stable and the patient was doing well. The
patient was taken to the ward for the remainder of her
postoperative care. We kept her on intravenous antibiotics and
nothing-per-oral until she passed flatus , at which point she was
able to tolerate a diet. Because of the duration of surgery , as
well as her large size , pulmonary toilet was encouraged with the
patient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient persisted with a
fever of unknown origin , again thought to be respiratory as
mentioned above. Cultures were taken and she remained on
antibiotics. Stentogram was done on postoperative day #10. This
showed extravasation of fluid distally in the ureter. Cystogram
showed no bladder extravasation. With that in mind , the Foley was
taken out and the stent was left in place. It was anticipated that
she would be taken back another time for stent removal. The
patient was discharged on 15 of May The external stent had actually
been switched over to an internal stent at the time of discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. CONDITION ON
DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with Dr. Kent J. Inagaki , and will call the genitourinary staff
or come to the emergency room for fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting
or other questions or concerns. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were
Percocet and Keflex.

ATTENDING: MIDGET , IRA M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hip fracture.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post hip surgery and end-stage renal
disease.
Please see original dictation for the history of present illness ,
past medical history , medications on admission , allergies , social
history , the family history , physical exam on admission , EKG on
admission and all data. Please also see that for the initial
hospital course this dictation only goes from August
through 3/24/07.
1. Orthopedics. There is no update on his orthopedics course.
He needs to continue his heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice
daily for one month following his surgery , which was 7/11/07 , so
he just about to complete this one month course. He should be on
Ultram 50 mg every twelve hours as needed for pain. All
narcotics should be avoided as these results in severe delirium
for Mr. Puotinen
No update to cardiovascular ischemia.
Cardiovascular rhythm. His Lopressor continued to be held for
the remainder of his hospitalization. His blood pressure was
within normal limits between 100-110/60-70 and his heart rate
remained in the 60s-70s , no higher than the 80s. If his blood
pressure increases , starting Lopressor again at 25 mg twice daily
would be wise , however , currently his blood pressure is not high
nor does his rate require this.
There is no uptake to his renal course. He continued on his
dialysis on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturdays. However , he also
got dialysis on Friday the 6 of July since he is being discharged
today , so that he can be changed to a Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday dialysis course at the Ans General Medical Center
From an endocrine perspective , he remained on sliding scale
insulin only. He did not need to be restarted on his Lantus.
There is no further update to his GI oncologic history. He
should continue to follow up with Dr. Trimboli on in 4/15/07 at
3:00 p.m.
From a delirium perspective , his Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime was
discontinued after his sense of delirium has been cleared for
multiple days. However , if he were to start to have any sorts of
hallucinations or issues with confusion , we would restart the
Zyprexa immediately 2.5 mg at bedtime +2.5 mg as needed. The
patient is currently stable again off Zyprexa , but it has only
been discontinued for two days , so he may well need this to be
added on. As soon as the Zyprexa is added on , he has cleared his
delirium pretty quickly , so this has been quite effective for
him.
From an ID perspective. He was continued on his rifampin 300 mg
twice daily as well as his penicillin 2 million units every four
hours and these antibiotics should be continued through 12/10/07.
He has an appointment with Dr. Kerschner in the ID Clinic on
8/20/07 at 8:00 a.m. to follow up on these issues. Please make
sure that the patient attends this appointment as it is very
important in terms of deceptive time running any changes in his
antibiotic course. He completed his course of Valtrex and does
not need any further treatment with Valtrex.
Gout. The patient developed gout in his right MCP and PIP joints
several days prior to discharge. He was restarted on his
colchicine every other day. He was also started on a higher dose
of prednisone of 20 mg daily. This should be continued for five
additional days and then he can be decreased back down to 10 mg
for several days and then down to his baseline dose of 5 mg
daily. He should continue on 5 mg of prednisone daily for the
foreseeable future.
From an FEN perspective , Nutrition was following the patient and
they recommended that he has his phosphorous checked regularly
and that he have assistance with his meals as much as possible so
that he can eat as much as possible.
From a hyponatremia perspective , his sodium was improved at the
time of this dictation and in fact on discharge , his sodium was
132. He should continue on free water restriction at the
King Ch Memorial Hospital as his hyponatremia is likely from
hypervolemic hyponatremia given his low albumin and poor oncotic
pressure.
Code status , the patient will continue to be full code at the
time of this discharge addendum.
TO DO: Please make sure the patient continues with his
antibiotics through 7/4/07 also make sure that he sees Trey Kachmarsky in the ID Clinic on 8/20/07 at 8 a.m. Please also make
sure that he sees Dr. Ronald Treiber at the Fullming Skaggs Ingoernstrong Rid Health on 4/15/07 at 3 p.m. as well as Dr. Milton Fiero on
2/5/07 11:30 a.m. He should also follow up with his primary
care physician , Dr. Criqui following discharge from Faxventci Medical Center
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
2. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily.
3. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d. , which should be
continued through the time of his discharge from rehabilitation.
4. NovoLog insulin as per sliding scale premeals.
5. Synthroid 75 mcg by mouth daily.
6. Nephrocaps 1 tab by mouth daily.
7. Zyprexa 2.5 mg by mouth every twelve hours as needed for
agitation or delirium.
8. Omeprazole 20 mg by mouth three times daily.
9. Penicillin G 2 million units IV every 4 hours.
10. Prednisone 20 mg every 24 hours for five doses , and then 10
mg every 24 hours for five doses , and then 5 mg every 24 hours
permanently.
11. Rifampin 300 mg by mouth twice daily.
12. Senna 2 tabs by mouth twice daily.
13. Flomax 0.8 mg by mouth daily.
14. Ultram 50 mg by mouth every twelve hours as needed for pain.
15. Effexor extended release 150 mg by mouth after dialysis.
16. ConvaTec Aquacel silver one topical daily.
Please remember to avoid narcotics and benzodiazepines in this
patient as he is very sensitive to medicines and may well
developed repeat delirium as has given them.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: 50 yo male s/p renal transplant presents will
acute on chronic renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 50 yo male with ESRD secondary to HTN , on
hemodialysis from 94-99 , s/p cadaveric renal transplant in 5/22 Over
the past few yrs , pt with increasing Cr: 4 in 2001 , 7 in 2002 , 8 in
early February of this year. He was in his USOH until 1 wk ago when he
developed R axilla infection ( hidradenitis suppurativa ) + DOE. Seen in
urgent care 10/18 , given keflex. Seen in renal clinic 1/27 and labs
revealed: Cr of 10 , bicarb 6 , k 6.8. Pt then sent to ED.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
RENAL: Pt admitted with acute on chronic failure. The etiology was
unclear. His FK level was 4.8 , his UA was normal , urine eos were
negative. His low bicarb was due to his underlying renal failure , and
his non-complaince with taking his bicarb replacement at home.
He was started on D5W + 3 amps HCO3 and was ultimately taken to
dialysis 6/11 due to his bicarb. As per renal his immunosupressive
regimen was changed. His cellcept was discontinued , his prednisone was
decreased to 10 qod , and his FK dose was decreased from 2 to 1mg bid ,
and was then to end after a period of 60 days. The patients K was
initially at 6.8. It subsequently decreased with kayexalate and
dialysis. The patient iPTH was checked and elevated at 399. He was to
continue dialysis upopn discharge.
ID - The patient was on renally dosed ancef for a right axilla
skin infection which improved during his hospitalization. His blood
cultures were negative to date at the time of discharge. His is to
finish a 7 day course of keflex as an outpatient. The patient
complained of right ankle pain on 8/2 , a plain film revealed no
fracture.

495854223 | SFH | 30148633 | | 9489074 | 10/20/2002 12:00:00 AM | LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/15/2002 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 10/30/2002
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease
status post five catheterization with a pacemaker in place ,
arthritis , gout , benign prostatic hypertrophy , hypertension and
myelodysplasia who presents with a history of lower
gastrointestinal bleeds. He has had three episodes in the past.
He presented to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
with symptoms of bright red blood per rectum. His vital signs at
that time were normal and stable with a hematocrit of 33. A tagged
red blood cell scan was negative during that hospitalization as was
an upper endoscopy. Colonoscopy revealed diverticula throughout
the large colon with more on the right than on the left. During
that hospitalization at the outside hospital , he was transfused
with four units of packed red blood cells and then transferred to
the Siter Calvty Valley Hospital for further evaluation and
treatment.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , his hematocrit was 32.9.
Subsequent serial hematocrits over the following
two days were stable. During the first hospital day , he had two
grossly heme-positive bowel movements and , by the second hospital
day , he had bowel movements that were brown and formed but guaiac
positive still. His hematocrit remained stable between 30 and 35
throughout his earlier hospitalization.
Given the patient&apos;s history of multiple gastrointestinal bleeds ,
the decision was made to perform a right hemicolectomy to prevent
further episodes. This was performed on hospital day number three.
See Operative Note for details.
The procedure and recovery were unremarkable. He was started on
sips on postoperative day number one and clear liquids on
postoperative day number two. He tolerated all of this well. His
Foley catheter was removed on postoperative day number two. His
diet was advanced. On postoperative day number three , he had
passed flatus. He began to have loose bowel movements. His diet
was advanced and , by postoperative day number four , he was
tolerating a regular house diet.
On the day of discharge , the patient was stable and tolerating
p.o.&apos;s quite well. His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain
medication of Percocet and he was voiding freely without
difficulty. He was ambulating successfully. Therefore , it was
deemed that he was suitable for discharge.
The patient was seen by his cardiologist , Dr. Poette throughout his
hospitalization. Prior to surgery , he was deemed suitable for
surgery without any serious cardiac risks. On postoperative day
#2 , the patient was noted to have a run of V-tach 10 beats ,
asymptomatic , no chest pain or discomfort , no shortness of breath.
He said that he was coughing at the time that that tracing came up.
A CK and troponin were sent which were both flat. The patient had
previously been ruled out for MI. Postoperatively , as a
prophylactic course , given that he has a ventricular pacemaker and
we could not follow EKGs based on that. The patient did well
thereafter , and had no further cardiac symptoms or issues. The
patient was seen by physical therapy throughout his postoperative
course and prior to discharge was deemed suitable for discharge to
home , was able to do all necessary activities to go home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol
25 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
p.r.n. constipation , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Flomax 0.8 mg p.o. q.d.
He will follow up with Dr. Weigold , his hematologist , in 2-4 weeks.
He will follow up with Dr. Condiff on 2/5/02. He was stable at
the time of discharge and is discharged to home with services.

*****
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 86F with hx CHF , Afib , CKD , and diabetes who
was admitted with partial SBO , bilateral aspiration pneumonia , and CHF
exacerbation.
-
GI: Admitted with partial SBO. She was treated wtih conservative
management. No NGT was required. The SBO resolved and she was passing
stool and tolerating a normal diet.
-
CV: She has a history of diastolic dysfunction. Echo 8/27 with EF 45-50% ,
no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w/ tr MR , tr AR , severe TR ,
mild-mod PR. She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to be
due to a CHF exacerbation. She was not agressively diuresed in the
setting of the partial SBO. She is on variable doses of lasix
( 80-200mg po bid ) at home. She was initially given lasix 80mg bid which
required additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose was
increased to 160mg po bid. Repeat CXR on 3/17 looks a little better than
admission. Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved. She no longer required
supplemental oxygen. She has a history of hypertension and was continued
on norvasc and imdur. She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin.
Her rate was adequately controlled. The coumadin was initially held due
to possible procedures related to the SBO. The INR remained in 2-3 range ,
likely due to the antibiotics. The Coumadin was restarted on 10/20 as the
INR was trending down , and was started at lower dose ( 2mg instead of 3mg )
given the antibiotics. Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as
an outpatient.
-
Pulmonary: She has a history of aspiration PNA. The Abd CT showed
bilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration. She was treated with levo
and flagyl. Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased during
hospitalization. She was afebrile. With treatment of the pneumonia and
CHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB. She will continue levofloxacin and
flagyl for an 8-day course.
-
Renal: She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2.8. Her Cr was
2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge. She continued home sevelamer.
-
Diabetes: Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for the
SBO. When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen of
lantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale
was restarted. Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due to
pneumonia. The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control to
Lantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale.
The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home.
HbA1c 8.2.
-
ID: Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin and
flagyl. Ucx with mixed flora.
-
Heme: Hct at baseline. As above , her INR remained high off coumadin ,
likely due to the antibiotics. Coumadin restarted on 10/20 at a lower
dose. INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient
-
Nutrition: She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deep
laryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with no
aspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum. Diet recommendations were
ground diet ( for lack of teech ) and thin liquids.
-
Disposition: PT recommended rehab. Patient and daughter prefer patient to
go home w/ services. The daughter is a nurse. New PCP is Dr. Hermes
( geriatrics ) at 12/10 at 2pm at
Mawe Tesparks In Hospital .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Pneumonia: She will be discharged on levofloxacin and flagyl to treat
her pneumonia to complete an 8-day course , which will end on 6/20
2. CHF: She will continue to take the lasix.
3. Hypertension: She should continue to take her previous medications.
4. Diabetes: Her insulin has been increased during hospitalization.
Continue to monitor the glucose levels and adjusting her insulin.
5. Coumadin: Her coumadin was restarted on 10/20 at 2pm ( lower dose than
prior due to the effect of antibiotics increasing the INR ). However , her
INR has been low at 1.5 and 1.4 , so the coumadin has been increased to
3mg at discharge. Continue to monitor her INR and adjust her coumadin as
needed.
6. Continue home PT as recommended.
7. Seek medical attention if she develops fever , chills , shortness of
breath , chest pain , worsening cough , or any other concerning symptoms.
8. The patient has an appointment with a new PCP , Dr. Lamar of the Dept
of Geriatrics , on 7/10/07 at Orvo Glumflu Carn Hospital .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Pneumonia: Patient will complete an 8-day course of levo and flagyl.
Monitor for resolution of pneumonia.
2. CHF: Patient will continue lasix. Continue to monitor volume status.
3. Afib: Patient will continue coumadin , will be monitored and adjusted
by Coumadin Clinic.
4. Diabetes: Patient will continue insulin regimen at home.

6-8/min with O2 desats to mid 80&apos;s on RA. Could be oversedation with
narcotics though she exhibited these episodes even when holding narcs ,
so more likely Pickwickian syndrome , will need a sleep study as
outpatient. She continues to complain of 8/10 pain even on her home
regimen of oxycontin/oxycodone , so we tried adding dilaudid and
morphin IR for breakthrough pain. Due to her apneic episodes and the
fact that she has not moved her bowels since admission we stopped these
and decreased her oxycontin by half to 10mg bid. Per pain service recs ,
we discontinued trazadone and added neurontin , as trazodone could be
contributing to her daily drowsiness , and neurontin may help with her
chronic pain. On discharge , we will not add any new narcotics. F/u pain
service as outpt.

Soc Hx: lives with grandson; quit tobacco in 2003; no alcohol
EKG: NSR , TWF V4-V6; LAE
***************************************
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
Her nexium dose was increased and she was initiated on reglan. Although
she initially agreed to an ETT-MIBI ( refused dobutamine , avoiding
adenosine/persantine due to COPD/asthma ) , on the day of the procedure
she refused saying &quot;there is nothing wrong with my heart&quot;. A similar
refusal occurred on a past admission. She is to be discharged w/ f/u
with Dr. Sheikh
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have any more chest pain please take a nitroglycerin. If the
pain does not go away call an ambulance. You may have heart disease
causing chest pain and so you will benefit from a stress test. Please
discuss with your doctor about scheduling this. Continue to take your
home medications. We have changed the dosing on the nexium and we have
added Reglan to help move food along.

grafting times three utilizing the saphenous vein graft from the
aorta to the LAD and aorta to D1 and aorta to OM 2. His postop
course was relatively uneventful. He remained hemodynamically
stable and his intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on the
first postop day. There were no problems discontinuing the IABP
and despite his peripheral vascular disease there was no problem
with the balloon pump. He continued to progress satisfactorily ,
was transferred to the Stepdown Unit , and was transferred to the
floor. He was placed back on his medication and he did have some
trouble swallowing postop but he had undergone an upper GI series
two weeks prior to his procedure which was read as normal. The
rest of his postop course was uneventful. His incisions healed
quite nicely and he was discharged on postop day six. His blood
sugar was controlled with CZI sliding scale while hospitalized. He
did have mild elevation in his BUN and creatinine to 32 and 1.6.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged with close follow-up to see Dr.
Barick in the office in four days. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Included Cardizem 60 mg tid , Percocet prn pain ,
Digoxin .25 mg q daily , Trental 400 mg bid , and Ecotrin one q
daily. His discharge instructions include a regular diet , no heavy
lifting or driving for at least six weeks. FOLLOW-UP: With Dr.
Olan in approximately six weeks time. He will see Dr. Silcott for
diabetic care as well as routine postoperative visit.

presented with orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion for three days.
She recently presented with CHF/bronchospasm syndrome in 1996 that
was ultimately ascribed to mitral regurgitation and thought
secondary to rheumatic heart disease. Her symptoms resolved after
St. Jude&apos;s mitral valve replacement in 2/10 She has been in her
usual state of health until approximately one week before
admission , when she contracted a flu-like illness with fever , cough
productive of yellow sputum , headache , and diffuse myalgias ,
postnasal discharge. She was prescribed amoxicillin by her primary

cardiomegaly , mild increase in interstitial markings , no effusions ,
no infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted to the Cardiology Service. She
was diuresed about one liter per day. During her
admission , and echocardiogram was done on 11/7/98 that showed
normal EF , normal systolic function , and normal valve motion. She
was hemodynamically stable throughout the course of her admission ,
showing only mild symptoms of heart failure that improved with
diuresis. She was continued on Coumadin , but given half her
regular dose because of antibiotic therapy. She was afebrile with
negative cultures during her admission , but complained of severe
paroxysmal coughing especially at night. For this , she was treated
with Atrovent and normal saline nebs , Robitussin , Entex , and
Tessalon-Perles. Her dose of Lopressor was half to relieve her
bronchospasm. By the day of discharge , her cough was much improved
and she was discharged home in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Premarin 1.25 mg p.o. q.d.; Robitussin AC
5-10 ml p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. cough;
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nortriptyline 125 mg p.o. h.s.;
Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Tessalon-Perles
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. cough; Entex LA 1 tab p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
cough; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. By the day of discharge , she had
completed a five day course of azithromycin.

Discharge Date: 11/18/1993
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ASTHMA EXACERBATION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION
3. ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old female
with the history of asthma , admitted
with increasing shortness of breath and chest congestion. She has
a history of asthma and has never been intubated. She has been
treated with steroid tapers in the past and hospitalized two times
before , most recently in 5 of September Her usual asthma exacerbant is an
upper respiratory infection. She smoked until 5 days ago. She
complained of 3-4 days of chest congestion and runny nose. She
denies any productive cough , fever , sinus tenderness or GI
symptoms. She called her NITAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL physician and was put on Prednisone
for the past two days. She felt that her wheezing was increasing
and she came to the Emergency Ward. Her peak flow was 100. She
was treated with three nebulizers and her peak flow increased to
130. Her oxygen saturations is 95% on room air and no blood test
was done. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has the history of chest
burning when she doesn&apos;t take her medications or walks too much;
has had labile T-waves in the past with catheterization in 1989 ,
revealed clean coronary arteries. There is no change with food and
there is no acid taste associated with this burning pain. She has
the history of hypertension; degenerative joint disease; anxiety;
right lower quadrant pain , ultrasound in 4 of February , revealed fatty
liver , HIDA was negative; status post hysterectomy. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on Atrovent
inhaler , Azmacort inhaler , aspirin one po q d , Verapamil SR 240 mg
po q am with 180 mg po q pm , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
po t.i.d. , Clinoril prn , Valium 5 mg po q.i.d. prn , Prednisone x 2
days. ALLERGIES: NKDA. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone in a
second floor apartment. She has three children and
several grandchildren. She is a retired nurse aid. She denies any
history of alcohol use. She smoked 1/2 pack per day until 5 days
ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission showed an obese black female in
no acute distress , able to speak without
difficulty. The blood pressure was 184/100 , pulse 80 , respiratory
rate 22 and temperature 97.8 with 96% saturations on 2 liters. The
oropharynx was clear with no erythema or exudate. The pupils
equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation; extraocular
movements were intact. The neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy , jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. The
cardiac was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops or
rubs. The lungs showed prolonged expiratory phase with diminished
air movement and diffuse wheezing. The abdomen was soft , non
tender , normal bowel sounds. She did have mild right upper
quadrant tenderness but no liver edge was palpable; Murphy&apos;s
significant was negative. The extremities showed trace edema
bilaterally. The neurological examination was non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission was remarkable for normal SMA ,
normal CBC. The chest x-ray revealed no
infiltrate. The EKG was normal sinus rhythm with some mild T-wave
flattening.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with asthma
exacerbation. She was treated with
bronchodilator nebulizers around the clock and initially IV
steroids. On the following day , she had mildly decreased wheezing.
Her peak flow had increased to 200. She was changed to oral
steroids. She continued to improve slowly with slow improvement in
her peak flow. Her steroid taper was begun early given the past
history of paranoia with steroids. She felt that the Bactrim gave
her cramping and therefore this was discontinued as it was felt
highly unlikely that she had a bacterial infection and much more
likely that she had a viral upper respiratory infection disposing
her to her asthma exacerbation. She slowly continued to improve
and was discharged to home to complete a steroid taper. She had no
episodes of chest pain or other difficulties while in the hospital.

A/P:
82 yo RHM with h/o HTN , DM-2 , CAD and AVR ( on coumadin until 9/22 )
was last seen normal when went to nap this afternoon at 12:45pm. At
2:30pm woke up dysarthric , mild RUE weakness. His wife noticed slowing
and confusion. Head CT at BMC ( repeated here ) showed small left BG bleed ,
extending to left lateral ( occipital horn ). Given location , most likely
hypertensive bleed. Cannot rule out underlying small stroke. Given h/o
AVR will r/o endocarditis as well. Plan
1. admit to NICU. When transfer to the floor TAGH
2. BP control with home regimen. keep SBP&lt;140
3. Hold ASA. Continue holding coumadin , clarify indication in
the future
4. Hold metformin for now ( in case needs CT/A ) , add insulin
sliding scale
Brief Hospital Course:
The hemorrhage was stable on follow-up imaging. INR was 1.1.
Neurologic exam was stable , with persistent dysarthria , right pronator
drift , and mild right leg weakness. Patient evaluated by PT/OT and
deemed appropriate candidate for acute rehab.
Cardiovascular: Continued to be in atrial fibrillation. Pacemaker was
firing , but on 5/25 pm had an episode of hr 30&apos;s x few seconds , and for
rest of night hr 40&apos;s - 50&apos;s. EKG unchanged from admission - atrial
fibrillation , left anterior fascicular block , some pvc&apos;s. Consulted
PH Cardiology , who analyzed the telemetry and found that bradycardic
readings were artifactual. There was no EKG obtained during bradycardia
and no documented physical exam findings to suggest bradycardia.
Cardiology felt there was no other evidence of pacer malfunction.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: RABAL , LONNIE M.D.
INTERIM DICTATION THROUGH September , 2006
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 69-year-old woman
with diabetes , hypertension , congestive heart failure ,
rheumatologic overlap syndrome with rheumatoid
arthritis/dermatomyositis , who was admitted for chest wall pain.
Of note , two weeks prior to admission , the patient reports a fall
during which she hit her chest on the floor. Upon admission , the
reasons for the patient&apos;s chest pain were unclear. Her cardiac
enzymes were negative and her EKG was unchanged. Chest x-ray was
negative for infiltrate. However , soon after the patient was
admitted to the floor she had high fevers and grew out
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her blood.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Dermatomyositis diagnosed in 2006.
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes complicated by neuropathy.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of Graves&apos; disease status post radiotherapy.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis/rheumatologic overlap syndrome.
6. Status post SBO.
7. B12 deficiency.
8. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction 45% ).
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , aspirin , codeine , Zocor.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Ent Saint She
has a home VNA two times per week. She is a former smoker , but
denies IV drug use and ethanol use.
STUDIES:
1. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on March , 2006
revealed a left ventricle normal in size. Estimated ejection
fraction was 55% ( previous echocardiograms had showed an ejection
fraction of 45% ). There were no regional wall motion
abnormalities. There was no significant pericardial effusion.
No vegetations were seen.
2. Transesophageal echocardiogram performed on May , 2006
revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness with no
regional wall motion abnormalities , trace mitral regurgitation
was seen. There was no evidence of valvular vegetations or
abscesses.
3. A CT scan of the chest without contrast on August , 2006 showed
a slight soft tissue prominence at the costosternal joint , but no
abscess and no bone destruction was seen. There was no drainable
fluid collection or bone destruction seen on the scan. MRI on
May , 2006 revealed a linear low signal within the sternum
suspicious for a fracture with adjacent rim-enhancing collection
extending both anterior and posterior to the sternum , suspicious
for an abscess. Hematoma is also possible.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had a negative rule out
myocardial infarction protocol. She was maintained on her
antihypertensive medications during her hospitalization and she
was hemodynamically well controlled. Because the patient had
MRSA bacteremia upon admission and because the patient had
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a possible
diagnosis. TTE and TEE , however , showed no vegetations on the
patient&apos;s valves. The patient&apos;s CRP on May , 2006 was 135 , the
patient&apos;s ESR on November , 2006 was 90.
2. Infectious disease: The patient had fevers upon admission to
greater than 101. Initial blood cultures revealed four of four
bottles to be MRSA bacteremia. Despite treatment with
vancomycin , the patient also had positive blood cultures on August , 2006. At the time of this dictation , the patient had negative
blood cultures from September , 2006 through March , 2006. She had a
bandemia to 6 on admission. It was not obvious initially what
the source was of the patient&apos;s MRSA bacteremia. Given her
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a
diagnosis. However , both TTE and TEE showed no evidence of
vegetations on the valves. The patient had a soft tissue
prominence on examination over her sternal manubrial joint on the
right side of her sternum. The original CT scan showed a soft
tissue prominence but no fluid collection. However , MRI on May , 2006 showed evidence of an abscess or hematoma in the right
subpectoral region. The patient had a CT-guided aspiration
performed on February , 2006 and 15 mL of pus was removed. The
drain was left in place. Studies from this fluid were pending at
the time of this dictation. However , the Thoracic Surgery
Service was consulted for possible debridement of the wound.
Infectious disease service was also consulted concerning the
timing for the placement of the PICC line , as well as the
duration of the patient&apos;s vancomycin.
3. Musculoskeletal: Chest x-ray showed evidence of an old left
shoulder fracture.
4. Rheumatology: The patient was maintained on prednisone for
dermatomyositis.
5. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on her home dose of
NPH. On this dose , the patient&apos;s blood sugars were well
controlled. The patient&apos;s TSH was measured A6 at 5.129 with a T4
of 7.2 and a THBR of 1.27. The patient&apos;s dose of Synthroid was
not altered.
6. Hematology: The patient was anemic on admission with
hematocrits ranging from 24-29. B12 level on November , 2006 was
199. She was given supplementation , both orally and IM , and on
November , 2006 her B12 level was 842. She was also found to have
both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Iron
studies from September , 2006 revealed an iron less than assay , a TIBC
of 202 , and ferritin 182. The patient was started on oral iron
supplementation during her hospitalization.
7. Skin: The patient was noted to have excoriations and open
lesions on her legs , which were likely due to itching. The
patient was given Bactroban. All of these excoriations were
clean , dry and intact. There was no evidence of infection.
9. Neurologic: The patient was maintained on amitriptyline and
Neurontin during her hospital stay.
10. Renal: On November , 2006 , the patient had a creatinine to
1.7. It is the feeling of the team that this is due to
gentamicin toxicity. At one point during the patient&apos;s
hospitalization , gentamicin had been added for synergistic effect
with vancomycin. Gentamicin had been added as the patient was
continuing to spike fevers despite vancomycin treatment. When
the patient&apos;s creatinine began to rise , gentamicin was
discontinued. Creatinine will likely resolve with time without
gentamicin administration in the future.
A component of the arf was due to repeated gadolidium exposure from repeat
mri of sternum and a hemodynamic with worsening when acei reinitiated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: March , 2006: In general , the patient is
fatigued and somnolent. At multiple times during the patient&apos;s
hospitalization , she became difficult to arouse. Upon touching
her sternum , however , the patient opened her eyes and was alert
and oriented. This seems to be her baseline behavior. There was
no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. The
patient had bilateral anterior chest wall pain to mild palpation
at the T3 level. Overlying the skin there was no erythema or
warmth. However , there was a fluctuant mass underneath the skin
surface. The patient&apos;s lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally , but she had shallow respirations due to pain on deep
breaths. Her abdominal exam was soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed multiple excoriations that were
clean , dry , and intact. Although the patient was somnolent at
times and difficult to arouse , she was alert and oriented x3 and
her neurologic exam was nonfocal. It appears that the patient&apos;s
excessive tiredness and excessive sleeping is her baseline
behavior. When the patient needed to be awake and oriented to
perform certain tasks , such as getting an MRI , she was able to do
so. Moreover , when she was witnessed interacting with her son ,
she was more alert.
CODE STATUS: Full code.
CONSULTS:
1. Infectious disease ( Mickey Vesley , Infectious Disease fellow ).
2. Thoracic surgery.
Dr. Burt Eldridge Conedy will dictate the remainder of the patient&apos;s
hospital course , including his disposition and discharge
medications.

Pain Control
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Notari was admitted to the Orthopaedic Hand Service on 9/11/2006
w/ a history of increased R shoulder pain following a cellulitis of
the right hand. An ESR was checked on admission and was slightly
elevated at 18. He was afebrile and non-toxic , therefore was not started
on antibiotics. Dilaudid was added to his pain regimen for his increased
discomfort.
On 5/30/2006 a CT guided R shoulder joint fluid aspiration was performed
by Radiology. Analysis of this fluid was not consistant with joint
infection.
He received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis during his admission. On HD#4 he
was awake , alert , appropriate and afebrile with stable vitals signs. His
pain was well controlled on oral medications. He was discharged to home
and instructed to follow up with Dr. Rumler at his previously scheduled
appointment on 4/27/2006. His final joint fluid cultures were pending at
the time of discharge , he will be contacted at home if these turn
positivie.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Do pendulum range of motion exercises regularly. This is very
important in maintaining full range of motion. You should not add any
additional exercises until cleared to do so by Dr. Stupka
2. You have been given a prescription for a narcotic for pain control. Do
not drive a motor vehicle , drink any alcohol or operate machinery while
taking this medication. As your pain allows , you should reduce the amount
of this medication accordingly. Narcotic pain medications can cause
constipation , so you should drink plenty of water and take a stool
softener ( Colace ) to help prevent this side effect.
3. Call Dr. Camelo at the number above , or your Primary Care Physician , or
go to a local emergency room if you develop fevers/chills , redness around
your incision that is warm to the touch , pus-like drainage from the
wound , loss of function ( either strength or sensation ) in your hand ,
return to your original symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath or any
other concerning symptoms.
4. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by Dr. Boys
5. Resume home medications unless specifically instructed otherwise.

Discharge Date: 6/10/2005
ATTENDING: IWANEJKO , COLLIN M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: Anaphylaxis.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6. Diabetic retinopathy.
7. Urinary tract infection.
8. Adrenal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takes
steroids and has developed adrenal insufficiency. She presented
to the emergency room with shortness of breath , wheezing , and a
maculopapular rash after receiving the pneumovax shot. She
received this shot upon discharge from admission to the Baybell Lolic Hospital for syncope and dehydration. The treatment there
was IV fluids in short course and increase in her steroids. In
the emergency room , she was treated with steroids , Benadryl , and
Pepcid.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Immunology: The patient was found to have anaphylactic
reaction to the Pneumovax shot that she received. Her
symptoms resolved by hospital day #1 after receiving IV Benadryl
around the clock , Pepcid , and an increased dose in her Hydrocort
to 100 mg IV q.6h. The steroids were started on a taper and on
the night of the first admission , the patient was noted to have increased
shortness of breath and
oxygen requirements. She was treated with oxygen and increased
steroids again for presumed reexacerbation of anaphylaxis.
2. Pulmonary: The episode of wheezing that she had on the first
day of admission could also be partly explained by fluid
overload. By hospital day #2 , she had developed crackles and
jugular venous distention. She has a history of diastolic heart
dysfunction , and diuresis was initiated. Despite receiving 3
doses of IV Lasix , she had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on the
second night of hospitalization. A chest x-ray was obtained at
that time which was consistent with pulmonary edema. She was
stabilized with additional Lasix and 100% nonrebreather mask , and
nitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 200 systolic at that time.
The plan for continued diuresis was interrupted on hospital day
#3 when she became hypotensive and febrile with a UA consistent with infection.
She was started on Levo for presumed urosepsis.
On hospital day #4 , diuresis was resumed as her blood pressure
stabilized around 110 , and she still had a 5-6L oxygen requirement. The
patient reports her dry weight is 140 to 143 lbs. Her
primary care doctor suspects it more like 149 lbs. She is
currently receiving diuresis to wean oxygen requirement and is
down to 1 L per nasal cannula. Her goal fluid status is to
negative 1 L per day , and she continues to receive Lasix IV to
meet that goal.
She was also restarted on p.o. Lasix 30 mg p.o. daily. There
was some concern about aspiration by the nursing staff. She
immediately had trouble with swallowing liquids and Speech and
Swallow was consulted. The patient failed the bedside swallow
exam and so a video swallow was obtained , which actually showed
no evidence of aspiration , and so she was continued on a regular
diet. By the time of discharge she did not require any oxygen. She would
intermittently desat to the high 80s , which would quickly resolve with deep
breathing or chest PT.
3. Endocrinology. The patient has a history of PMR and adrenal
insufficiency , on 30 mg of Hydrocort daily at home. On the
May , 2005 , in the setting of urosepsis she was placed back on stress
dose steroids which was then tapered back to her home dose throughout the
rest of her hospitalization. She has a history of
diabetes type 2 requiring insulin inhouse or oral agents. Oral
agents were held and insulin was given for glucose control , NPH
30 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening seemed to
control the a.m. and p.m. sugars pretty well. Regular insulin
was added 6 units in the morning with breakfast with the morning
NPH for 1 p.m. blood sugar control , as this was the highest blood
sugar daily. Obviously , this needs to be monitored and adjusted
as needed as well the medicine staff is going to be following her
as to whether she should resume the oral agents. She does on
occasion drop her blood sugar to 50 or 60 , which is usually
asymptomatic.
4. Renal: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0. Both her BUN and
creatinine were elevated with diuresis. Her creatinine needs to
be monitored closely and medications need to renally dosed.
5. Infectious Disease: Her urine was positive for greater than
100 , 000 group B hemolytic Streptococci and she was initially
started with Levaquin. It was switched to penicillin on January , 2005 , after the gram-positive organism was discovered and she
was switched back to Levaquin after the sensitivities came back ,
and it was sensitive to Levaquin. The Levaquin is ideal because
her coughing could also represent bronchitis. She has complained
of a cough since weeks before admission , which is now resolving.
6. Disposition: The patient does not feel that she can care for
herself at home and screening was placed to Er Medical Center , and that was accepted for the acute care center
for Saturday , March , 2005.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is just to follow up with
primary care physician. She should also follow up with Dr.
Wann from Pulmonary at the Reddis Hospital University Of An
appointment will be made for her. She should return to the
emergency room if she experiences chest pain , further shortness
of breath , severe sweating , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , or
other concerns.
LABORATORY DATA: On discharge , glucose 116 , BUN 30 , creatinine
1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 3.4; please make a note that her
potassium requires repletion and should be monitored; chloride

Discharge Date: 10/8/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2. STATUS POST CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WITH
PTCA.
3. UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
4. HYPOTENSION.
5. HISTORY OF ESOPHAGITIS.
6. HISTORY OF URINARY RETENTION SECONDARY TO
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old man with
a history of hypertension and pipe
smoking , who was admitted with a one month history of exertional
dizziness and diaphoresis. The patient had an ETT in September 1992
where he went 6 minutes and 34 seconds on a standard Bruce to a
maximum heart rate of 145 and a maximum blood pressure of 170/90.
The patient stopped secondary to fatigue and did not have any chest
pain. The EKG showed 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in II , III and F and
V4-V6 , and was read as suggestive of coronary artery disease. The
patient was put on Atenolol 500 mg q.d. two weeks prior to
admission. The patient was also diagnosed with hypertension at
this time. One day prior to admission , the patient had three
episodes of exertional substernal chest tightness associated with
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and shortness of breath. Each
episode lasted 20-40 minutes and resolved with rest. The final
episode being on the day of admission at 9 A.M. There was no
nausea and vomiting. The patient denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and leg edema. The patient was treated in the Emergency
Room with Aspirin , Nitro Paste and oxygen , and sent to the floor
for further evaluation and treatment of his unstable angina. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes a history of a hiatal hernia , history of
recurrent esophagitis , with endoscopy in January 1991 which was
negative for Barrett&apos;s esophagus. The patient also had a history
of lower GI bleeding in July of 1991 , and a colonoscopy showed
diverticulosis. The patient had a history of urinary retention
secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. He also has a history
of urethral calculi and is status post an appendectomy. The
patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Include Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. and Zantac 150 b.i.d. The patient is
a long time pipe smoker , and he denies alcohol use. FAMILY
HISTORY: Is notable for a father who died of a myocardial
infarction in 1962.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was a 63 year old male in no
acute distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
blood pressure 110/60 , pulse 64 , and respiratory rate of 18. His
pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light. The extraocular
movements were intact. His oropharynx was clear. He had no
jugular venous distention. He had 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. His lungs were clear. His heart was a regular rate and
rhythm , S1 and S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. His abdomen
was soft , nontender , with positive bowel sounds , and no
hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema. His neurological exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam was
guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 107 ,
CO2 26 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose
148. The admission CK was 70. He had normal liver function tests.
His LDH was 144 , cholesterol 171 , triglycerides 257 , hematocrit
45.5 , platelets 198 , white blood count 7.42 with a normal
differential. PT 12.4 , PTT 27.4. His chest x-ray showed clear
lungs , and the EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with an axis of
-4 degrees. There were T-waves in aVF , T-wave inversion in lead
III. There was no change from an EKG in October 1992.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for rule
out myocardial infarction and treatment of his
unstable angina. On the floor , the patient experienced chest pain
and an EKG showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. As this
indicated that the patient was having an acute inferior myocardial
infarction , the patient was taken to an emergent catheterization as
PTCA was contraindicated because of his history of diverticulosis
with lower GI bleeding. At catheterization , the patient was noted
to have a 90% RCA lesion and a 90% LAD lesion. The RCA lesion was
successfully dilated , and the patient was admitted to the CCU for post
myocardial infarction care. His post MI course was complicated on 5/10/92 by
400 cc of coffeeground emesis. The patient&apos;s hematocrit fell from
40 to 35 , but was then stable. His Heparin and Aspirin were held ,
and the patient was given Omeprazole and antacids. The patient
also had an episode of left arm pain without any significant EKG
changes. As well , the patient experienced an episode of
hypotension with the blood pressure falling to the 70&apos;s following a
dose of Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The patient was treated with IV fluids
and was then stable. On 2/15/92 , an echocardiogram was notable for
left atrial size of 4.0 , inferior and posterior left ventricular moderate
hypokinesis but good overall LV systolic function. There
was 1+ TR , 1+ AI , and 1+ MR as well. On 2/15/92 , the patient was
transferred to the floor where he was noted to have a low grade
fever of 100.2. A subclavian catheter was removed and cultured ,
and several blood cultures were sent. The catheter tip culture
grew coagulase negative Staph but his blood cultures were negative.
This was felt to represent a contaminant and not requiring IV
treatment. The patient thereafter showed no signs of infection and
was afebrile. On the evening of 10/16/92 , the patient experienced
two episodes of sharp left sternal chest pain , one lasting five
minutes and the other three minutes , though unfortunately no EKG
was done at the time. The following day , the patient was
ambulating without chest pain. There were no further episodes of
chest pain. The patient was begun on low dose Inderal 5 mg t.i.d.
On the second , the patient had an ETT with a modified Bruce
protocol which was stopped at 8 minutes secondary to fatigue and
shortness of breath , and a maximum heart rate of 120 , and blood
pressure of 140/70. There were 1 mm ST depressions in leads I , L ,
anda V2-V6 which persisted during recovery. The patient was
presented with the option of remaining in the house with a repeat
catheterization with probable angioplasty of his LAD lesion the
following Monday ( 3/15/92 ) or recovering at home with readmissions
in one to two weeks for a repeat catheterization with
PTCA. The patient and his wife decided to opt for recovery at
home , and the patient was discharged on 6/8/92.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old male with
morbid obesity and history of multiple DVTs and pulmonary emboli ,
status post IVC filter placement who presented to the emergency
room with hemoptysis episode x1. He reported two tablespoons of
bright red blood when coughed up , but he did not have a
persistent cough. No shortness of breath. No fevers , chills ,
night sweats or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Morbid obesity , DVTs , PEs , hypertension ,
total hip replacement and status post hernia repair.
ALLERGIES: Versed.
EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , respirations 22 , blood
pressure 114/78 , oxygen 97 on room air. General: He is obese ,
talkative , walking around. Had moist mucous membranes. Unable
to assess JVP due to size. Lungs: Clear. Heart: Regular
without murmurs. S1 and S2 were normal. Abdomen: Obese ,
nontender , and nondistended and soft. Extremities: Show chronic
venostasis changes without evidence of cyanosis , open wound and
some edema was present. EKG on admission showed normal sinus
rhythm at 74 beats per minute with no significant ST-T changes.
Chest x-ray that he brought from an outside hospital showed right
hilar prominence with question of a mass. Chest x-ray in the
emergency room at the Dwindshutzuc Memorial Hospital showed no
acute process and severe pulmonary congestion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 144 , potassium 4.1 ,
chloride 102 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose
104 , white blood cell 3.7 , hematocrit 54 , platelets 188 , INR 2.1 ,
PTT 33. An echo in September 2005 showed mild LVH and ejection
fraction of 55%-60% , increased RV , right systolic function mildly
reduced and mild RAE and LAE.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In the emergency room , the patient received
vitamin K 6 mg x1 to reverse his Coumadin in the setting of
hemoptysis.
1. Pulmonary: The source of his hemoptysis was initially
unclear. His sputum looked only blood tinged on the admission
exam , but the patient reported bright red blood prior to
admission. His chest x-ray from the outside hospital looked like
a right hilar prominence , which was read as a possible mass , but
a repeat study done in the emergency room at the Crantlupethes Tyli Medical Center showed
only pulmonary congestion and no mass or acute process. He has
very minimal history of smoking cigarettes in the past. He was
too large to fit into a CAT scan machine , so he underwent a V/Q
scan , which demonstrated low probability for pulmonary embolus.
The pulmonary service was consulted and their impression was that
his hemoptysis was likely secondary to severe pulmonary
hypertension but not a mass or infection. They opted not to
perform a bronchoscopy and recommended starting sildenafil for
pulmonary hypertension. The Gini Shawn Health , the Pulmonary
Hypertension Service was then consulted. They did not recommend
the sildenafil so that was actually not started. They did
recommend starting torsemide 80 b.i.d. for better diuresis and
this was initiated and resulted in good urine output. His home
dose of diuretic was 80 mg of Lasix daily. Upon discharge , he
was sent home on 80 mg of Lasix twice a day with recommendations
to have his blood drawn , to measure electrolytes within a week ,
and follow up with his PCP as soon as possible. The Gentm. Cathege Charleba Medical Hospital
recommended an outpatient cath and he was instructed to follow up
with them. He also reports a history of sleep apnea and BiPAP
use at home , although he admits that he does not use the BiPAP
machine. He was set up with BiPAP and nighttime oxygen inhouse
and he was continued on Coumadin for his history of pulmonary
emboli. His Coumadin was held initially on admission in the
setting of hemoptysis , but it was restarted after the V/Q scan
was low probability. He was also placed on a heparin drip while
the Coumadin was not therapeutic. He was discharged on 12 mg of
Coumadin daily.
2. Cardiovascular and hypertension: He was continued on his
home meds.
3. Infectious disease: He did develop bilateral lower extremity
erythema and tenderness on 1/14/05 and he was started on IV
Ancef 2 g q.8 h. for presumed cellulitis. This was changed to
Keflex upon discharge.
4. Gout: He continued on his home meds without incident.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have his
lytes drawn within a week by the PCP , VNA , or lab center. He was
instructed to have his INR measured on Monday or Tuesday and for
the results to be sent to his PCP and/or the Coumadin Clinic. He
was instructed to use oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula for 15
hours overnight and to use the BiPAP machine and elevate his legs
while not walking or standing and to wear compression stockings.
ALLERGIES: Midazolam.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENT: He has an appointment with Dr. Dzuro ,

3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Diabetes.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Peripheral vascular disease.
7. Smoking history.
8. History of alcohol abuse.
9. History of seizure disorder.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mauras is a 72-year-old man with
history of CAD status post CABG , PCI with history of stable
angina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , former
smoking history and also history of seizure disorder with
cataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He had occasional
anginal symptoms prior to discharge. He took about two
nitroglycerins per week. Over the past week , he had escalating
chest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. The pain was
relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. One week prior to admission ,
his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. His
Plavix was stopped and his Coumadin was held. On the morning of
admission , he had chest pain. He had two nitroglycerins and
rested but the pain persisted. He was taken to the ED. In the
ED , he received Lopressor , Enalapril , Lovenox treatment dose and
a Plavix load.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes CAD , hypertension , CHF , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and past
smoking history.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for past alcohol and smoking
history. He quit alcohol 25 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Significant for afebrile , heart rate 45
and blood pressure 95/50. He had a left surgical pupil , left eye
ptosis at baseline. His heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft , nontender and
nondistended. He had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.
No pronator drift.
LABS: Significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , white
count of 13. His troponin peaked at 6.4.
EKG showed ST depressions in V3 through V6 that were new.
Echocardiogram on 3/23/05 showed an EF of 25 to 30% with septal
akinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspid
regurgitation.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course for this 72-year-old man with
non-ST-elevation MI.
1. Cardiovascular: A catheterization on hospital day 1 showed
four-vessel disease. No intervention was taken at that point , as
it was unclear which region was the culprit. Afterwards , he was
in hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema. He received Lasix and morphine and he was
started on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. He was
found to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response. He was taken back to the
catheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous vein
graft , OM1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went to
the CCU afterwards. On hospital day 3 , he was transferred to the
floor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejection
fraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. His troponin had
been trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. His beta-blocker and
ACE inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.
Prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonary
edema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based on
his prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place a
dual-chamber pacemaker with AICD. He has had no respiratory
events since that placement. He has remained in atrial
fibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. He was started on
his Coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yet
therapeutic. His repeat echo did show an EF of 55%. This was
after the pacemaker was placed.
2. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. He was given
Mucomyst precath with good effect. His creatinine on discharge
was 1.1 and he was making urine.
3. GU: He has had some symptoms of urinary retention with
difficult-to-place Foley. He was started on Flomax with good
effect. His prostate was not overtly large on exam. His PSA was
within normal limits.
4. Endocrine: He is a type 2 diabetic. His home dose of
metformin was held. He was continued on Lantus with sliding
scale insulin.
5. Hematology: His hematocrit was transiently down to 24. When
transferred out of the CCU , he was given three units of packed
red blood cells given his history of CAD. Since this , his
hematocrit has been stable in the 30-to-32 range. An abdominal
CT did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. His groin
had only a very small hematoma. His stool guaiac was only trace
positive.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home in stable condition with VNA

PPM at present.
**
1 ) R lower ext Ulcer and cellulitis - cellulitis initially treated with
nafcillin IV for 5 days with improvement in both swelling , erythema , and
pain. Discharge from the wound was cultured and grew out Ecoli and
Enterobacter , sensitive to cipro. Abx were switched to cipro which would
provide coverage for the gram negatives growing from her wound and also
cover her cellulitis. She will complete a total abx course of 12 days
( additional 5 days of cipro ). There was an initial concern for DVT but
LENIS were negative. Zinc and Vit C were added to her regimen. She will
also need Wound changes with NS wet to dry BID. The ulcer is most likely
due to poor wound healing in the setting of chronic venous stasis. It was
also noted that she had very weak LE pulse so vascualar surgery was
consulted. She was found to have + peripheral pulses by doppler , and
follow up with vascular surgery was set up for her. She will also get
umaboots and ABI at her followup.
***
2 ) bradycardia: to 30&apos;s during sleep. Pt came in on atenolol which we
discontinued , esecially in the setting of CRI. No tachyarrythmia on Tele.
Good HR response w/ actviity up to 70s. Evaluated by EP and felt that
she was not a candidate for a PPM at this point , especially since her
bradycardia is assymptomatic. It was felt that her bradycardia is most
likely due to her OSA , and that she would benefit from a sleep study. If
her bradycardia does not improve after treatment of her OSA , then she
will need to follow up with EP for further evaluation.
***
3 ) ENdo - fasting glucose normal , HGA1C -5.4.
***
4 ) Renal - CRI at baseline. No issues during hospitalization
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. take antibiotics for full course , if ulcer or cellulitis worsens or
does not improve after antibiotics please call your doctor
2. stop taking atenolol
3. New medications: cipro , ascorbic acid ( vit C ) , zinc
4. Follow up with PCP

Discharge Date: 11/26/1998
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest and epigastric pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
is having a significant amount of GI
distress with belching and gas over several months to years who
presents with three hours of upper abdominal and chest discomfort
which she described after a fall day of volunteering and doing her
exercise. Actually she was sitting down to eat and then developed
this symptom that lasted for about three hours. The patient did
not that she has run out of her Atenolol for more than three days
prior to admission and came to the Emergency Room when her pain did
not resolve after taking some Tums and some water. The patient
denies any previous history of angina. She came into the Emergency
Room and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. The
patient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on her
Atenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure and
resolution of her symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesteremia.
ALLERGIES: Streptomycin.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q d.
4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d.
5. Colace.
6. Multivitamin.
7. NPH insulin 20 units q a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a senior&apos;s home. She does
not smoke or drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She was afebrile. Blood
pressure 150/90 , heart rate 84. O2
saturation was 94-97% on room air. GENERAL: The patient was a
pleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during her
history. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation except for
some initial left basilar crackles , which have cleared. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. RECTAL: Heme negative , per
examination in the Emergency Room. EXTREMITIES: She did have some
bilateral trace edema. NEUROLOGIC: Non-focal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: SMA-7 was significant for a glucose 236. CPK
was 74 , troponin 0.04. CBC and coags were
normal. Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette with
mild evidence of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute
ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit.
She was put on cardiac telemetry and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with serial CPKs and EKGs. She had
no further episodes of her discomfort but did have continued
belching. On further discussion with the patient , she was actually
a relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms in
the past and never described any shortness of breath , PND or
orthopnea. The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do an
adenosine stress test. Her adenosine stress test was negative for
chest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixed
reversible defects. She therefore was felt to be negative for
ischemia. However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did have
a mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significance
and unknown etiology. It was felt that this could be further
worked up for other causes , including sending out for TSH , SPEP ,
UPEP , and iron studies as an outpatient , as the patient was anxious
to leave the hospital. This could be done in clinic by her primary
care physician.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on her admission
medications with the addition of Axid 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and simethicone 80 q.i.d. p.r.n. for her gas. The patient
will discuss her GI symptoms with her primary care physician and
would benefit from further workup as an outpatient. The patient
was discharged in stable condition with no adverse drug reactions.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Gustavo Setaro in approximately
one to two weeks.

PROCEDURE:
AVR with a 25 CE magna valve , CABG x2 with LIMA to LAD and SVG1
to PDA , pulmonary vein isolation , and left atrial appendage
resection.
BYPASS TIME:
171 minutes.
CROSSCLAMP TIME:
107 minutes.
??__04:13___?? antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia. Patient is in
normal sinus rhythm , rate of 80 at end of case. There were no
complications. The patient was transferred to the unit in stable
fashion with lines and tubes intact. 9/6/06 , postop day 1 , the
patient was slow to ambulate. Postop day 2 , responded to gentle
diuresis. Meds changed to p.o. Postop day 3 , chest tubes and
wires were discontinued. Somnolence resolved. Fluid overloaded.
Loss of secretions. Able to clear up. Postop day 4 , failed
speech and swallow. Wires discontinued. Hemodynamically stable
in Afib since evening. Rate controlled. Diuresing well.
Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day 4.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Mildly confused immediately postoperative , now
resolved , neurologically intact.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac meds: Aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Hemodynamically stable on Lopressor , now back in Afib , stable
rate of 90s , respiratory ventilated greater than 24 hours
postoperatively. Extubated on postoperative day 1 without
complication. Currently on 5 liters of O2 and some pulmonary
edema , improving with Lasix 20 mg IV t.i.d. and diuresis.
GI: Failed speech and swallow. Bedside Dobhoff placed. Started
on Osmolite tube feeds at 20 mL an hour. Awaiting nutrition
input for goals. Needs video swallow to assess swallow function.
Renal: Appropriately diuresing , maintaining 1.5 liters negative
until preop weight.
Endocrine: Stable on CVI. Hematology: Anticoagulation.
Coumadin and aspirin for atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues. Prophylactic antibiotics for chest tubes. In
step-down unit proceeded to progress well. Postop day 4 strict
n.p.o. per speech and swallow for aspiration with all
consistencies , currently on sitter. Postop day #5 , the patient
self discontinued the Dobbhoff feeding tube twice last night
requiring meds IV today until tube replaced and KUB confirmed tip
this afternoon. Dobbhoff currently okay to use. We will resume
tube feeds. Heart rate elevated to 90s-130s and also run of VT ,
which was asymptomatic. Rechecking electrolytes , BP stable.
Preop EF of 45%. Ordered echo to assess postop EF given run of
VT , which was 9 beats. Normal a.m. electrolytes. Remains on 3
liters of O2 , diuresing well. Speech and swallow will reassess
next week. Strict n.p.o. for history of aspiration. Afebrile.
White count improved to 10.9 , remains on sitter for mild
confusion. Plan rehabilitation when ready. Postop day 6 ,
chronic Afib , rate has been difficult to control , patient was on
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. postop via Dobbhoff tube. Patient
has self discontinued Dobbhoff several times and is quite
sensitive to missed dose of oral Lopressor so dosing IV Lopressor
currently. Heart rate is still a bit elevated at 100-120s , BP
stable. Mental status improved off sitter. Remains on 1.5
liters of O2 junky cough , unable to produce sputum. Afebrile.
White count stable at 10.4.
Chest x-ray looks okay. No echo ordered for her fellow. Repeat
electrolytes. Titrate beta-blocker. We will reorder echo if VT
recurs. PT consult placed. Postop day 7 , past video swallow
exempted. Dobbhoff out on sitter because he is having suicidal
ideations. He has been quite hyperglycemic with blood sugar in
350 range. EMS following. Screening for rehabilitation. Postop
day #8 , running a bit fast in Afib. Increase Lopressor. Mood
has improved. Will most likely be able to discontinue sitter
soon. Screen for rehabilitation. Postop day #9 in Afib running
between 90-100 , had been on a sitter up until this a.m. for
suicidal ideation a couple of days ago eating well. Screening
for rehab. Postop day 10 , rate controlled Afib/room air.
Patient followed by psych for postoperative confusion/possible
suicidal ideation. Patient stable on Celexa. Patient&apos;s UA from
7/12/06 with probable enterogram-negative rods. Started Cipro
x3 days. Continue rehabilitation screen. Postop day 11 , Afib ,
rate controlled/room air. Patient&apos;s chest x-ray with no edema ,
slight left middle lobe atelectasis. Neurologically stable and
Celexa ordered per psych. Awaiting rehabilitation bed. Postop
day 12 Afib/room air doing well with blood pressure. Seen by
psych and recommend follow up with them post DC for memory
studies. No new ??__??. Ready for rehabilitation. Just waiting
for acceptance and bed. Postop day 13 , rate controlled Afib/room
air. Patient waiting for rehab bed. On Coumadin for Afib ,
followed by psych for confusion/delirium and note by them that
they would like to follow up with him when he is discontinued.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Lightheadness , nausea
---
DDX: Hypertensive Urgency
---
HPI: 77 year old female with CAD s/p three stents , DM , HTN and CKD
was sent to ED by PCP after she presented to office with malaise ,
nausea and lightheadedness. Her symptoms first developed on
Thursday. She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were
300 and 150 systolic. Her symptoms resolved but returned on Sunday
PTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went to
see her PCP. At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolic
and she was sent to the ED for evaluation. Of note , on route to the
PCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest &quot;cramping&quot; which
was unlike her previous angina or MI pain. ---
In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mg
po X1 , nitropaste 3&quot;. Her BP remained above 200 despite these
medications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 which
resulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic.

---
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for management of
hypertensive urgency.
---
CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. There is no indication of
med non-compliance. Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her.
Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. She
was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. There was discussion of
increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.
In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of
feeling lightheaded. Therefore her hold parameters were increased to
130 systolic. In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heart
beats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasional
slight pauses &lt;2sec. No major events on telemetry. Her heart rate was
relatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. Her EKG did show
slight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and her
CKMB was elevated on admission. She ruled out for MI with three sets
of neg troponins. She may have had slight demand ischemia in setting
of hypertension. Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. Her troponins
were always negative. She had no s/s of CHF. She was monitored on
telemetry with no major events.
---
RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recent
history of contrast induced nephropathy. She had proteinuria on
admission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) but
her creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). A renal
ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. UPEP , SPEP
and spot urine/protein were ordered. Her spot urine protein was 222. Her
proteinuria in a chronic problem. UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as
outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.
---
ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home.
She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent am
BS was high. She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and then
she resumed Lantus that evening. She also received her home humulog
and a sliding scale. She received a carb controlled diet. Her TSH was
1.2 on home Levoxyl.
---
FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed.
---
GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and a
slightly distended CBD. Bili T and D were added and are normal. She had
no abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely to
represent a pathology.
---
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if &gt;180.
2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) and
record in a note book to bring to PCP appointment
3. Return to ED if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath ,
worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concerns
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up UPEP/SPEP. Follow Blood Pressures. Follow Fingersticks.

Discharge Date: 5/18/1991
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 year old white female
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post bypass in l988 who presented with atypical
chest pain consistent with unstable angina for rule out myocardial
infarction. Patient has multiple risk factors including a history
of inferior myocardial infarction , smoking history , family history ,
and age. She does not have diabetes mellitus or increased
cholesterol. In 1/24 , she had an inferior myocardial infarction
and had a catheterization in April of l988 showing 70% left anterior
descending , 50% right circumflex , and l00% right coronary artery
lesion with an ejection fraction of 80%. In l988 , she had three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to her left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her OMB2 and right
coronary artery. The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer
disease diagnosed with melena in 3/10 and had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. In 11/23 , she
had a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history of
chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and an
MCV of 68. Patient was treated with H2 blockers and iron but
stopped secondary to constipation. In 7/18 , the patient again
presented with orthostatic changes and shortness of breath with
pain to her arm similar to her previous myocardial infarction pain.
Her hematocrit at that time was 20.8. She was transfused three
units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix and H2 blockers.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a catheterization
in 7/18 that showed patent LIMA to her left anterior descending ,
her left anterior descending native vessel was free of disease , and
a 50% long proximal circumflex lesion as well as a proximal OM2
lesion that was narrowed to 70% at its origin. An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and the
patient was discharged home for colonoscopy with Small Bowel
Follow-Through that was never done. In the interval period prior
to admission , the patient was in her usual state of fair health
when she had an hour of chest pain in the morning and thirty
minutes in the evening per week. She also noted several episodes
at rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. The
patient presented to GH with a thirty minute history of
substernal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingual
Nitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mild
shortness of breath. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for
coronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease as
above , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiency
anemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history of
chronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her blood pressure was l22/90 ,
pulse of 90 , respiratory rate of l6 , and
temperature 98.2. HEENT: Unremarkable. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation. NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity ,
regular rate and rhythm with a positive S4. There were no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. She had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits.
ABDOMEN: Showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , and
non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. EXTREMITIES:
Showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses without
bruits. She had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. RECTAL: Showed
normal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. NEUROLOGICAL:
Grossly non-focal and within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 with
a white count of 6.9 and an MCV of 63.
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees ,
intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a Q wave in III , and T wave
inversions in III , V3 , and Vl-V4. These were all unchanged from
her previous EKG from 5/6
HOSPITAL COURSE: Remarkable only for a rule out myocardial
infarction in which she had serial CK and EKG
that were completely within normal limits. Her CK were l54 , 482 ,
and 592 with normal MB fractions most consistent with either a very
small myocardial infarction or , more likely , CK leak from some
other source. Patient had several episodes of atypical chest pain
after being moved down to the floor and EKG were completely within
normal limits without any evidence of acute changes. Patient was
transferred to the floor on September and her significant laboratory
data included a white blood cell count of 5.89 , hematocrit 34 ,
platelets 458 , and MCV of 68. Calcium was 9.4 , magnesium 2.6 ,
sodium l37 , potassium 4.6 , chloride l03 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN l8 ,
creatinine l.l , and glucose 9l. Serial CK were l54 , 482 , 592 , 553 ,
464 , and 3l2 , with MB fractions all less than l0. Her iron was l4
and her TIBC was 479 with a ferritin pending. Urinalysis showed
20-30 white blood cells with 3+ bacteria and a urine culture showed
greater than l00 , 000 E. coli. This was treated with Bactrim. On
July , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had an
exercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modified
Bruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak heart rate
was 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocal
premature ventricular contractions with her exercise. She had
non-specific ST and T wave changes only without evidence for
ischemia. This was thought to be inconsistent with ongoing
ischemia and the patient was discharged to home. Of note , the
patient is not an AKH patient and has no primary doctor.
Therefore , I am going to assume her care as an out-patient in NIDA TION HOSPITAL .
Pending laboratory data includes ferritin level.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Exercise tolerance test as above and
blood products received were none.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , ECASA , 80 mg
p.o. q.d. 2 ) Bactrim one tablet double-strength
p.o. b.i.d. times seven days. 3 ) Sublingual Nitroglycerin one q.5

HPI: History was obtained from patient , who is a poor historian. He is
an 83 yo man with a history of CAD s/p MI in 1973 , s/p CABG x3 , T2DM ,
hypertension who presents &quot;feeling sick&quot; since last night. He states
that he took a Percocet for back pain and that after that he began to
feel numb in his arms and legs and around his head. He also had some
chest pressure. He took some SL nitro and doesn&apos;t remember if it helped.
Says it also wasn&apos;t relieved by positional change or rest. He denies
shortness of breath. He was having some nausea but no vomiting. He does
have some blurry vision at baseline , unchanged. He awoke this morning
and took his blood pressure. When he found his systolic was 190 , he
called EMS. He said he felt dizzy , &quot;like I have pressure in my head , &quot;
and could not describe it beyond that. He states that when his BP is
elevated his head feels like this and he gets flushed in the face.-----

Discharge Date: 6/1/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Non Q-wave myocardial infarction.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 60-year-old woman who was
admitted for chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of diabetes
mellitus , cerebrovascular accident in
1994 , gastroesophageal reflux disease , recurrent transient ischemic
attack , who was in her usual state of health until the day prior to
admission when she developed chest burning 3 days ago. The
symptoms were associated with nausea. She tried Maalox and H2
blocker without relief. The patient had stuttering symptoms off
and on throughout the day and night without relief. She was
brought in to BMC today , given aspirin , sublingual Nitroglycerin
and transferred to the Montexo Medical Center for further
evaluation. In the Emergency Room , her systolic blood pressure is
130. She was tachycardic , and she was given IV Nitroglycerin. The
patient then became hypotensive due to overaggressive
Nitroglycerin. The patient received Inderal for tachycardia. No
tirofiban was given given her history of cerebrovascular accident.
Her chest burning was not resolved with IV Nitroglycerin. She was
given Morphine sulfate x 2 mg , Inderal and an esmolol drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypothyroidism. 2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension. 4. Borderline personality
disorder. 5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 6. Parathyroid
adenoma. 6. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy. 7. History
of migraine headache. 8. Chronic re-elevated liver function tests.
MEDICATIONS: 1. Atenolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. 2. Insulin 70/30.
3. Regular insulin. 4. NPH. 5. Metformin. 6.
Valium. 7. Aspirin. 8. Synthroid.
ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN , NOVOCAINE , ALDACTONE which all give hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with CVA at age 21.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a schoolteacher. No alcohol or tobacco
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 132/84. Heart rate 94.
O2 saturation 93% on 2 liters. Sclerae were
anicteric. The lungs were clear. Heart was tachycardic , regular
with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen was with slight
hepatomegaly. Normal bowel sounds with slight right upper quadrant
pain. Lower extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: CK 336 with an MB of 9.7. Troponin was 8.4.
Chem-7 was normal with a BUN of 8 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Hematocrit was 42. White count was 7.
Platelets 196. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis
deviation , normal intervals. There were Q-waves inferiorly and
anteriorly with poor R-wave progression and persistent S in V6.
There were slight ST segment increased elevations in V2 of 1 mm and
T-wave inversions in V2 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Due to her history of cerebrovascular accident ,
no thrombolysis was attempted. She was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit and treated overnight with increased
dosages of beta blocker and had intermittent symptoms. She went to
catheterization and was found to have 100% left anterior descending
with right to left collaterals and poor distal flow as well as a
90% mid and 90% distal right coronary artery with significant
vessel tortuosity. The left anterior descending was percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplastied with question of distal
dissection which required stent placement. It led to initial good
result. A wire was passed through the stent , but no balloon could
be passed. There was no proximal stent placed due to poor outflow.
The plan was to return to Catheterization Laboratory to attempt
right coronary artery stenting. However , she subsequently spiked a
temperature to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. She was pan cultured and
her sheaths were removed. No antibiotics were started at that
time. Her urine subsequently grew greater than 100 , 000 E. coli ,
and she was started on levofloxacin with plan for a repeat
catheterization once afebrile x 24 hours. She underwent repeat
catheterization and had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the right coronary artery lesion. She was
transferred to the floor on 3/3 On the night at the procedure ,
she had an episode of desaturation to the mid 80 percent range on
room air. A chest x-ray revealed a question of congestive heart
failure vs. a right upper lobe infiltrate. She had another fever
to 102.2 , and she was pan cultured. Her diuresis was increased at
that time.
On 11/27 , the patient began to show signs of paranoia and
inappropriate behavior , and a psychiatry consultation was obtained.
The patient described visual perception about her room being
smaller and was complaining about changes in her medications
without her being informed. Psychiatry felt that she was delirious
and they recommended getting her family more involved to help
reorient the patient. On 3/15 , the patient was oriented and in her
usual state of mental status according to her cardiologist , Dr.
Greever The patient was demanding to go home at that time. Dr.
Janikowski preferred to have a dobutamine MIBI test performed prior to
her discharge , but it was decided that this could be done at a
later time as an outpatient.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day
for 5 days. 2. Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
3. Atenolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. 4. Synthroid 175 mcg PO q.d. 5.
Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. for chest pain. 6. Nitropatch 0.4
mg per hour topical q.d. 7. Ranitidine 150 mg PO b.i.d. 8.
Simvastatin 40 mg PO q.h.s. 9. Insulin 70/30 30 units subcu q.a.m.
and 18 units subcu q.p.m. 10. Plavix 75 mg PO q.d. x 30 days.
FOLLOW-UP CARE: The patient was to follow-up with her primary care
physician the week of discharge and to follow-up
with Dr. Tutela the following week. She was to have her thyroid
function tested in 6 weeks. She was advised to check her
fingerstick sugars four times a day , keep a diary of those numbers
in order for her insulin dosage to be adjusted.

cell count of 11.4 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelet count
267. SMA-7 revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , BUN 34 , creatinine 2.1 , glucose 238. Creatinine
kinase was 12. Troponin I was 0.17. Electrocardiogram on
admission was significant for a supraventricular tachycardia at 140
beats per minute. There were no ST segment elevations and no acute
changes. Chest x-ray was significant for low volume in the right
lung. The left lung was essentially clear. There was no
compression. Echocardiogram on admission was suggestive of
pericardial tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to General Medical
Service on November , 2000 and taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where he was found to have pericardial
tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was attempted in the catheterization
laboratory on November , 2000 , however it was complicated by right
ventricular puncture. The patient was transferred to the operating
room emergently on November , 2000 for right ventricular puncture
repair and for pericardial window. The patient was followed by the
Surgical Service postoperatively until his cardiac and pulmonary
function were stable. He was transferred back to the Medical
Service on August , 2000 for further evaluation and treatment of
pain and further evaluation of his renal function. Hospital course
by treatment issues as follows: 1 ) Chronic pain: The patient&apos;s
pain was felt to be likely due to chronic back conditions and also
pericardial pain. The patient was given narcotics , however became
somnolent requiring Narcan reversal. Pain Service consultation
suggested a regimen of Ultram , Vioxx and Prednisone. The patient
showed improvement on this regimen. In addition , the patient
received steroid trigger point injections with some symptomatic
relief.
2 ) Acute tubular necrosis: On August , 2000 through April ,
2000 , the patient had increase in his creatinine to 2.5 thought to
be of pre-renal etiology secondary to Lasix he had received on the
Surgical Service. He received fluid boluses improving his
creatinine. However , he developed hypernatremic diuresis on September , 2000 through January , 2000 which was thought to be a post
acute trivial necrosis diuresis. He was treated with continuous
intravenous fluids of D5 1/2 normal saline with improvement. By
September , 2000 , his creatinine continued to improve to a level of
1.1 , and the patient&apos;s diuresis subsided.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebulized

Discharge Date: 11/25/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SUPERFICIAL THROMBOPHLEBITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: SLEEP APNEA , HISTORY OF RECURRENT
DVT&apos;S , GERD.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Scheuring is a 50 year old woman
followed by Dr. Elmer Larry in WENTMA HEALTH NETWORK Clinic
with a history of recurrent DVTs who presented with pleuritic chest
pain and left lower extremity calf pain. She had a DVT about 10
years ago in the left lower extremity. She was coumadinized at that
time for 3 months. In September of 1994 she had an abdominal hernia
repair and had recurrent DVT by LENIs but was not treated. On 8/5
she presented again with a left lower extremity pain and was found
to have an acute and chronic deep venous thrombosis and was
anticoagulated with Heparin and changed to Coumadin at home. The
patient was poorly compliant with her Coumadin. In October of 1995
she was too depressed to take her Coumadin. Her INR dropped. She
had sharp chest pain like gas over her precordium. The pain cleared
spontaneously. Eventually she called her REQUEST MEDICAL CENTER primary doctor , Dr.
Babbish complaining of this pain and was admitted to the Misent Tlhealtmigo Medical Center for rule out MI and rule out PE. VQ scan at that
time was low probability. She was discharged on Coumadin 5mg a day
and Lasix 20mg a day for lower extremity edema. A dobutamine MIBI
was also performed and was negative. On 1/10 she came to the EW
complaining of chest pressure and left lower extremity swelling.
She reported that since 7/25 she started having right anterior
chest pain with chest wall pain which was increased with deep
ventilation , no cough. She did have some increased shortness of
breath and she reported increased swelling and pain of the left
lower extremity and overall was feeling poorly.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is as above and also includes obesity and
osteoarthritis of the knees.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lasix , Zoloft.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was obese black female. Temperature 98.1 ,
heart rate 72 , blood pressure 138/80.
Respiration is 20. 02 saturation on 4 liters was 96%. HEENT:
Unremarkable other than obesity and a sick sounding voice. Chest:
Clear to auscultation. Cardiac Exam: Regular rate and rhythm with a
II/VI systolic murmur over the left sternal border , no S3 , no S4.
Abdomen: Obese , soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left lower extremity
was tender in the calf but not warm , no erythematous. She did have
trace edema. Her pulses distally were 2+ on both sides.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for a hematocrit of 47 , a white
count of 5.2 , platelets of 236 , normal
SMA7 , a PT of 13.9 and INR of 1.3 , a PTT of 31.5. Chest x-ray
showed no acute infiltrate. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at
78 with an axis of 58 , normal intervals , Q in III , and F in I ,
upright Ts in III , no RVH , no strain compared with prior EKGs. ABG
on room air was pH of 7.39 , PC02 of 47 and P02 of 57 , 88%
saturation. LENIs showed no right DVT , a left greater saphenous
vein superficial venous thrombosis , no change compared with 10/16/95.
A VQ scan was low probability and when compared to the study of
October 1995 was entirely unchanged.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , heparinized and begun on
Coumadin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and INR of 2-3.
Her calf pain was felt secondary to superficial thrombophlebitis
and post phlebitic syndrome. Interventional Radiology was consulted
to obtain a PA gram , however they felt that the risk of the
procedure outweighed the benefits given that her VQ scan was
entirely unchanged from prior. Her hypoxia seemed related more to
her sleep apnea. She was started on CPAP , which she tolerated
rather poorly , however was encouraged to continue to use it given
her potential long-term benefits. She had an 02 saturation on room
air in the high 80s to low 90s , which improved when she used the
CPAP. There was an initial thought that there may be cellulitis in
the left lower extremity , however this was born out clinically and
she was initially started on I.V. oxacillin in the Emergency Room
but this was stopped after one day. Of note , her chest pain seemed
to be quite esophageal or reflux related and she was started on
Axid with remarkable decrease in her symptoms. Sputum culture was
obtained and showed oral flora. She had no infiltrate on chest
x-ray and was not treated for bronchitis either.
DISPOSITION: She was therefore discharged in stable condition to
follow up with Dr. Lamp in Clinic as well as the Sleep
Study Lab recommended that she follow up with ENT to see if any
surgical options were available to her in correcting her sleep
apnea. MEDICATIONS: Lasix 20mg p.o. q day , Coumadin 5mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Zoloft 50mg p.o. q day , Axid 150mg p.o. b.i.d. She will
follow up with Dr. Derek Hodgens in Clinic and in the ENT Clinic 1-2
weeks after discharge. She will also follow up in Coumadin Clinic
two days after discharge to have her INR checked in HENNABE HOSPITAL .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The pt is a 58 yo man with NIDDM , HTN , elevated
cholesterol , and CRI , who presented to his PCP 11/23 c/o 2D of SS chest
pressure. The patient has had prior admissions for chest pressure
but negative ETT 1998-1999 ( ETT-mibi 1999 with no fixed
or reversible defects , EF 50% ). He reports that
2D ago he developed SS chest pressure with L
arm tingling/pain; episode occured at rest and
lasted 10-15&apos;. He has had a few episodes per day
since , almost all at rest ( the patient went up a
few flights of stairs last night without difficulty ).
Not associated with N/diaphoresis/SOB. Did not change with position.
The pt&apos;s wife feels that his sx are similar to his complaints in 1999.
The patient reported a history of &quot;heavy/labored breathing&quot; over past
few weeks , concurrent with some weight gain ( the patient had been
trying to lose weight but &quot;lost his motivation&quot; and
went from 275-&gt;305 10/18 ).
No PND/orthopnea/DOE , + some mild swelling
around ankles. Pt also reports URI sx over past
week with dry cough/stuffiness , no f/c , +
mild nausea. URI sx resolved before chest
pressure episodes began. The pt presented to his
PCP with this complaint and was brought to ED , given
1 SLNTG and pressure resolved. He also
received lopressor 2.5 IV/25 PO and ASA 325.
Home meds included
cardizem/amaryl/prinivil/lipitor/asa/flomax/detrol/
palmitate A. No tob since age 18. +FH early MI. PE in ED: T 96.7 , HR
80 , BP 139/80 , 100% 2L. R eye deviated laterally. Periph field
cut. Chest clear. JVP 7 cm. RRR , I/VI SEM RUSB , obese , nl abd
exam , trace pretibial edema. EKG no change from
prior. 1st set enz flat. Labs Cr 1.4 ( baseline
1.3-1.6 ).
Hospital course:
CV: CAD/ischemia: multiple CRF ,
past negative ETTs , sx unrelated to exertion but
c/w angina otherwise ( pressure/L arm paresthesia ) ,
with no assoc sx. Pt was r/o for MI by serial enz/ekgs. Cardizem was
dc&apos;d and he was started on lopressor and transitioned to atenolol fo
r d/c ( though it was not possible to get an accurate assessment of
BP on lopressor given short stay/nitro paste in house. ) He was
continued on ACE/lipitor. Stress portion of ETT-mibi ( separate from
rest given pt&apos;s weight/need for higher doses of marker ): pt walked
for 5&apos;20s , reached DP of 24 , 480. He had no CP or EKG changes and
only small amt SOB at max exertion. Mibi showed a small defect in
the mid-basal portion of the inf-lateral wall , which if reversible
would suggest a small area of ischemia in the OM distribution. It was
decided that the lesion , even if reversible , was of low enough risk
that the patient could go home and return for the rest portion on
Monday. He was dc&apos;d on his adjusted meds as above and will f/u with
Dr. Yao Monday to arrange BP check. Pump: the patient did not s
how evidence of fluid overload on exam , and it was thought that his
inc SOB x 1 mth or more was due to his weight gain , but ECHO was o
btained for baseline study and results were pending at dc.
DM: amaryl held while in house , ISS. microalbumin/Cr ratio was nl at
6.1 , compared to 51 in
11/14 amaryl restarted for d/c.

sinus rhythm at 48 with inverted T waves in aVL. Chest x-ray on
4/22/06 was read as normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Brief operative note.
DATE OF SURGERY:
4/25/06.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
PROCEDURE:
CABG x4 , sequential graft , SVG1 connects aorta to D1 and OM2 ,
LIMA to the LAD and SVG2 to PDA.
BYPASS TIME:
124 minutes.
CROSSCLAMP TIME:
112 minutes. One ventricular wire was placed. The patient came
off cardiopulmonary bypass on one of Levophed.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
After the operation , the patient was transferred in stable
condition to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Upon arrival to
the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , he was noted to have low
hematocrit and was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells. After
obtaining another hematocrit level once this transfusion to
place , his hematocrit was found to be increasing appropriately.
He was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #1. While on the Cardiac Step-Down Unit , his course was
complicated by the following:
1. On postoperative day #4 , it was noted that the Ms. Didonna
had some erythema on the superior portion of his mediastinal
incision that was also tender to palpation. As a precautionary
step , the patient was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl. Cardiac Surgical Team elected to keep Mr. Kneser in the
hospital while his mediastinal incision was observed. Over the
next several days , Mr. Schehr &apos;s erythema had decreased and there
was no noted discharge from the incision. It was felt that there
was no evidence of mediastinal as Mr. Pappalardo remained afebrile
and did not have leukocytosis. His triple antibiotic therapy was
stopped and Mr. Quaresma will be sent home on oral antibiotics.

The condition responsible for causing this admission is
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Other diagnoses include
left bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , Gleason&apos;s score
2/4 , C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and also
status post AICD and dual chamber pacer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male
well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart
Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting
with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last
night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. The patient first went
to An Medical Center ER then left AMA without further treatment after
waiting four hours. He reports increasing cough with white
sputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especially
over the last three days. Also there is a questionable increase
in abdominal distention. The patient had been admitted five
times in the last six months with the last admission also for
worsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which he
notably had a TEE-guided cardioversion and diuresis. He was
discharged on creatinine of 1.7. The patient freely admits that
he has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,
claiming that he has been &quot;eating like a horse&quot; with meat and
heavy sauces on pasta. The patient denies chest pain , fevers ,
sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to erythromycin and
penicillin , which causes a rash. He also describes an allergy to
contrast.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and in
no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80
beats per minute. His HEENT exam was unremarkable. Carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. There were no thyromegaly
and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiac exam did demonstrate JVP of about 18 cm and also regular
rate and rhythm with an S1 , S2 as well as an S3 and 1/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdominal exam was notable
for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile
palpable liver edge. There was no tenderness to palpation. The
extremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only trace
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for BUN of 45 ,
creatinine of 1.6 , K of 4.3 and sodium of 136. The INR was 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular. The patient was in volume overload and his
ARB and Aldactone were held. Aggressive diuresis was undertaken
for most of this stay including an IV Lasix drip , which was later
weaned to a torsemide IV b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.
b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the IV formation in the
form of itchiness. He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout the
stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later
discontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of NSVT that he had
possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. However ,
dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increased
gradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg and
the patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. In addition ,
electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patient
underwent a workup for an LVAD placement including PFTs ,
peripheral and carotid Dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. He was shown to
have significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent a
contra-indication for LVAD. Discussion ongoing with the patient during his
stay revealed that he would prefer not to have the LVAD
even if he were eligible. He understood that he was not likely to live long
with the severity of his heart failure. The decision was later made to send
the patient home with a Hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he could
receive home dobutamine. In terms of ischemia , the first set of
enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active
issue. There were no changes on EKG. In terms of rhythm , the
patient does have history of prior AFib , however , he has remained
in normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. He has had
asymptomatic runs of NSVT on the dopamine and less so on the
dobutamine as mentioned above. Currently he was paced with an
AICD. We kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well as
on tele.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. We monitored
the patient&apos;s BUN and creatinine while diuresing and although ,
the patient did have an increased BUN to about 70 , diuretic
treatment was continued as a primary goal.
3. Endo. The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,
putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. Also
the patient had low TSH. This is probably due to subclinical
hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.
4. Heme. The patient is on Coumadin as an outpatient and we
titrated his INR to a goal of 2-3. The patient did have some
nosebleeds on 10/21 and his Coumadin was temporarily held , but
restarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. The INR goal was
decreased less than 1.5 where the placement of Hickman catheter
with the plan to restart the Coumadin after placement.
5. Prostate. The patient does have a history of prostate
adenocarcinoma , Gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. This has been
discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has
refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did
consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed
that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration
given the degree of his heart failure.
Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was
comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating
his food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVP
was about 10 cm. Cardiovascular exam showed occasional PVCs and
a loud P2 and S3. In general unchanged from admission.
Respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breath
sounds were equal bilaterally. His abdomen was somewhat
decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.
Extremities were warm without edema. Pulses were 1+ radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did have
some wasted lower extremities.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
Services. The plan is to follow his INR on Coumadin and to
continue to monitor his heart for NSVT while on dobutamine. Also
consider an ARB or Aldactone. The patient has stable kidney
function with decreasing creatinine.

Discharge Date: 3/5/1994
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. PULMONARY EMBOLUS
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary
to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness
of breath and left pleural effusion. He returns now with increased
cough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on
exertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,
treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied by
chemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented in
July of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have
an ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy
felt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated with
Digoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She had
subsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate of
approximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studies
with therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite well
until February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough
productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and
left-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix and
Digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in
her symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to
have a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent
ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax
requiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid
revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology
remaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for
approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then
discharged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had no
improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which
remains productive of white sputum with occasional &quot;specks of red&quot;
and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable to
go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.
This is a significant change from approximately one month ago where
she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She has
stable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight has
increased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,
sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. She does not
anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. Breast carcinoma
as above. 3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drug
allergies. Habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no ETOH.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg q day , Lasix 80 mg q day , Capoten 50
mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , Synthroid 2 gr. per day , Tamoxifen
10 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 75 mg q day , K-Dur 1 q day. SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without
children. She is a semi-retired Accounts Manager. FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no family history of cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,
heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02
saturation 90% on room air. The patient is alert , responsive ,
febrile and in no acute distress. Her conjunctiva are clear ,
extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. She has no
lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at
30 degrees. Lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at the
left base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness
to percussion. Cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm with
normal SI , SII , positive SIII. Abdomen is soft and non-tender ,
slightly distended. She has pitting edema almost to the knees
bilaterally. Neurological examination is non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 and
creatinine of 1.2 with a BUN of 20. CBC
demonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets
289 , Digoxin level was 1.2. Chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-
consolidation. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,
normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no
significant change compared with 7/24/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a picture of chronic
productive cough , progressive dyspnea with low
grade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to
new opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to be
mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on
underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive
infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. The
patient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including
cefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by the
Pulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive
diuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention
such as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thus
treated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomatic
result. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that
a chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for
possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thus
underwent a chest CT on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a large
peripheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a
right lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions or
lymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient&apos;s history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the
chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult
Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically
for a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin with
achievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin
without complications. In addition the patient underwent lower
extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , this
echocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle
with severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection
fraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shaped
opacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than
infarction , it was felt that given the patient&apos;s low ejection
fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,
and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to
alter management. The patient was discharged to home.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS:

INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Cardiology Tuc Pla
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF exacerbation.
2. Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with a
history of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrial
fibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , on
amiodarone until January 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skin
discoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since a
stent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations for
cardiac-related issues. In July 2006 , he notes that he began to
feel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasional
palpitations , although he denied any chest pain. He was found to
be in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , with
continuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardioverted
in September 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until January 2006
when he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea with
exertion. An echocardiogram was done in January 2006 , showing an
ejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for sudden
death , a single-chamber ICD was placed.
He continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end of
January , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,
and abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical angina
symptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on 9/18/2006 ,
which was terminated after 1 minute when the patient&apos;s heart rate
went up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still he
reports continued symptoms as previously described as well as
decreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. He
endorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks prior
to admission. He was started on amiodarone on 11/4/2006 for
atrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presented
to Dr. Gabard &apos;s clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. He
was admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation
and for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial
fibrillation.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. Tota is a retired lobbyist. He currently
lives in Jo Car Mont with his wife. He does not smoke. He does not
drink excessively. He does have an occasional glass of wine or
two at dinnertime.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for brother who died of an MI at age
58 , father who died of an MI at age 78 , and mother with
atherosclerosis.
ALLERGIES: Flagyl to which he gets edema and Demerol.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals were temperature of 95.7 ,
heart rate 80 , blood pressure 144/78 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 97% on room air. Generally , this is a
comfortable-at-rest-appearing gentleman in no respiratory
distress. Neck shows JVP is approximately 7 cm. His heart exam
is irregularly irregular with abnormal S1 and S2 , soft S3. Soft
systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. No S4 or rub.
No heave or palpable thrill. His lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is obese , mildly tender
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pulses and 1+ pitting edema from ankles to
thighs bilaterally. His neuro exam is grossly intact , and he is
alert and oriented x3.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 1.6 , glucose 218. ALT 26 , AST 29 , total bilirubin
0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 66. BNP 659. White blood cells 599 ,
hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 196 , 000. Lipids: Total cholesterol
121 , triglycerides 166 , HDL 37 , LDL 51. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with ventricular rate in the 70s. Normal intervals.
No ST changes. Echocardiogram , 10/27/2006 : Ejection fraction
30%. Left ventricular diameter , end-diastole , 6.2%; end-systole
4.8%. Septum is thin and akinetic at the apex. There is a
hypokinetic mid to distal wall , posterior and inferior wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. There is
a dilated aortic root. Chest x-ray , 10/27/2006 , shows
cardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions.
PROCEDURES: On 2/25/2006 , the patient was started on
dofetilide.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient was started with a
diuretic regimen of Lasix 40 mg IV twice a day given that he
appeared to be volume overloaded by clinical exam. On
presentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart
failure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2
to 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the in
and out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on
10/20/2006. His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACE
inhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serum
creatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor following
complete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signs
consistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued on
aspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient&apos;s history of atrial
fibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on
Toprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to
pursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had
previously experienced ). It was decided to proceed with
dofetilide therapy on 10/20/2006. His QTc was monitored
throughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and DC cardioversion on 8/7/2006 for further
treatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient&apos;s Coumadin was
continued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achieve
this goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.
3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was taken
off oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose of
Lantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin sliding
scale.

evaluated Dr. Burl Srader , for which differential has included NASH ,
hypothyroidism , drug ( avandia? , less likely ACE or lipitor ). She
underwent an U/S guided liver bx 6/26 performed by IR. After the
procedure , she had documented hypotension with a presyncopal episode.
Immediate CT showed hematoma around her R and L liver lobes and some
peritoneal blood superior to spleen but noretroperitoneal blood. She was
sent to the ED for evaluation. Her BP normalized with NS , and she was
never tachycardic. Serial hematocrtis were 35.1 , 32.8 and 29.8. She
was not transfused. A repeat CT showed stable hematoma with
peripancreatitc stranding , and she was admitted for further observation.
After the procedure she complained of RUQ and periumbilical pain. She
currently denies pain and expresses interest in eating. Denies N/V.

HOSP COURSE:
The patient has had elevated LFTs of unknown etiology and had a liver
biopsy on 6/26 after which she developed a liver hematoma by CT with Hct
drop from 35 to 29.8 ( in the context of hydration for a pre-syncope
episode ). Repeat CT showed the hematoma was stable but also showed some
peri-pancreatic fat stranding somewhat concerning for pancreatitis by
needle aggravation ( since not significant amounts of blood were observed in
the retroperitoneal area ). Lipase and amylase were slightly elevated at 85
and 74 respectively , but she had no symtpoms of abd pain , nausea , vomiting.
Recheck of lipase and amylase within 12 hours showed stable or improved
values of 69 and 74 respectively. Her Hct was stable at 31.5 upon recheck.
She had peristent absence of abdominal pain and tolerated a full diet
without complications. Her anti-hypertensive meds ( HCTZ and ACE ) were
held due to SBPs in the 100s and should be continued as outpatient as
necessary per followup with PCP Devon Mccahill Her ASA was also held and
should be restarted per Dr. Kelderman as outpt.

Discharge Date: 6/10/1995
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Loften is a 62 year old woman with
cardiac risk factors including
hypertension , diabetes mellitus , postmenopausal , who presents with
exertional angina x four months. On the day prior to admission ,
she had a nondiagnostic exercise tolerance test , and was admitted
for cardiac catheterization on March , 1995. Upon further
questioning when the patient presented for catheterization , it was
found that she had a previous allergic reaction to intravenous
contrast dye that caused laryngeal edema. For that reason , the
patient was admitted for premedication overnight prior to
catheterization.
The patient , again , is a 62 year old , and is a patient of Dr.
Mayer , with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
diabetes , elevated cholesterol , a positive family history , and
being a postmenopausal woman. She first noted exertional
substernal chest pain about four months prior to admission. The
pain radiates to her left arm , and is associated with shortness of
breath , but no diaphoresis or nausea or vomiting. The pain is
relieved by rest within two minutes , or by a sublingual
Nitroglycerin , which she has used in the past week x two. Her
exercise tolerance is limited by this pain , and is diminished to
+/- 50 yards on the flat surface at present. The patient had one
episode of pain at rest three nights prior to admission. She
denies shortness of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.
She was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction on August ,
1995 , and ruled out by enzymes and electrocardiogram. She had an
echocardiogram done which revealed an ejection fraction of 60
percent , with no regional wall motion abnormalities. She had 2+
mitral regurgitation , 1+ aortic regurgitation , and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The day prior to admission , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test. She went two minutes on standard Bruce
protocol , stopped secondary to diaphoresis and shortness of breath
without chest pain , and she had nondiagnostic electrocardiogram
changes. The patient was admitted for premedication for her dye
allergy and subsequently catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. She has a history of a deep venous thrombosis in 1994.
5. She has chronic renal insufficiency , with a GFR of 48 , and the
twenty-four hour urine shows 3.8 grams of protein.
6. She is status post cholecystectomy.
7. She has vitiligo.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin q.d.
2. Enalapril 20 mg b.i.d.
3. Cardizem 300 mg q.d.
4. Insulin mixed 70/30 with 60 units in the morning and 30 in the
evening.
5. Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies include contrast dye which gives her a
rash and laryngeal edema , Penicillin which gives her
edema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone , but has two very
supportive daughters. She has no smoking or
alcohol history.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her family history is significant for brothers who
had myocardial infarctions in their 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s ,
and a mother who had a myocardial infarction when she was 69.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination , this is a very pleasant
Clarkant Prings U woman , who speaks predominantly
Spanish , who is in no acute distress. Her vital signs were a
temperature of 98.6 , heart rate 71 , blood pressure 168/70 ,
respiratory rate 18. The remainder of her examination was
significant for flat jugular venous pressure , but questionable
bruit in the left carotid. Cardiac examination was significant for
a normal S1 and S2 , with an S3 noted , no murmur. Her extremities
showed trace edema bilaterally , 2+ pulse in the left femoral , no
pulses palpated on the right , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Her labs are significant for a creatinine of 1.7 ,
an elevated cholesterol at 294. Her urine showed
3+ protein , 1+ glucose. Her electrocardiogram was normal sinus
rhythm at 78 , with normal axis and interval , and lateral V4 through
V6 T wave flattening.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was catheterized on March ,
1995 , with results showing proximal left anterior
descending stenosis of 50 percent , mid left anterior descending
stenosis of 70 percent. The distal left anterior descending was
diffusely diseased , and her first diagonal showed a discrete
stenosis of 80 percent. On the right , she had in the proximal
right coronary artery a discrete lesion of 50 percent , and in the
mid right coronary artery diffusely diseased at 50 percent. The
patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the mid left
anterior descending artery stenosis from 70 percent to 10 percent.
The patient&apos;s post catheterization course was complicated by a loss
of 150 cc of blood after her right groin sheath was removed , but
the bleeding was stopped after 90 minutes of compression. Her
hematocrit on admission was 35.9 , which dropped to 30.1 after the
sheath removal , but remained stable and she was discharged with a
hematocrit of 30.8. The patient also had one mild occurrence of
chest pain post catheterization which was relieved with two
sublinguals , and showed no electrocardiogram changes.
Upon discharge , the patient was noted to have elevated liver
function tests , with an ALT going from 16 to 156 , an AST going from
16 to 65 , an alkaline phosphatase going from 87 to 171. The
patient&apos;s primary medical doctor , Dr. Schummer , was notified and
agreed to workup the elevated liver function tests. The patient
was discharged on her admitting medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
2. Enalapril 20 mg b.i.d.
3. Cardizem 300 mg q.d.
4. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
5. Additionally , she was started on Simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was discharged with a scheduled appointment
the day after discharge with Dr. Mondone

He had a temp of 100.2 , his blood pressure was 120/79 , and his
heart rate was 96 beats per minute. He was satting at 96% on 2 L
of nasal cannula. HEENT: His JVP was at 9 cm , he had 2+ carotids
without bruits. His extraocular motions were intact. His pupils
were equal , round , and reactive to light. His cardiac exam was
significant for regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and an S4.
There were no murmurs. His lungs had decreased breath sounds on
the lower right base with crackles about one-third of the way up
on that side. His left lung was clear. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present.
Extremities: He had 2+ pedal pulses. There was no pitting edema.
Skin: Noted to be hypopigmented , the patient has a history of
albinism. Of note , one additional comment about his HEENT exam ,
the patient is legally blind. He is able to see most objects at
about 6 or 7 feet away from him.
His chest x-ray showed a right middle opacification concerning
for an infiltrative pneumonia. His EKG on admission post cath
showed a rate of 98 , sinus rhythm , and ST elevations 2 mm in V2
through V3 and ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. Labs on
admission were significant for creatinine of 1.4 up from a
baseline of 1.2. His cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 178 and MB
of 3.7 and troponin of less than assay. His CBC was normal.
There was no left shift. His UA was significant for a specific
gravity of 1.086 , 1+ protein , 3+ glucose , 2+ ketones , 2+ blood ,
1-3 white blood cells , 2-4 red blood cells , and trace bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. CV: Ischemia. An emergent cath on admission on 2/18/04
showed two-vessel disease and 100% LAD , osteal lesion , and a 90%
marginal 1 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 3.5 x 8 mm and a
3.0 x 13 mm and a 3.0 x 18 mm Cipher stents all to 0%. The
marginal 1 was not stented during this cath. The patient&apos;s CK
peaked at 10 , 438 , and a CK-MB at 452 and his troponin at 721.
The patient was transferred to the CCU after his cath. He was
treated with aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , Integrilin
x12 hours. The patient recovered well except for his heart rate
remained in tachycardiac at 90 to 110 range despite Lopressor
which was increased to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. With the setting of
tachycardia , he developed ST elevation in 1 aVL with ST
depressions and 3 aVF in the evening of 3/7/04 , although his
cardiac enzymes continued to turn down. The patient underwent a
second cath on 8/12/04 , which showed that all his stents placed
in his LAD previously remained patent. The marginal 1 was
stented at this time with Cipher stent 0. The patient was doing
very well after his second procedure. His heart rate remained
slightly tachycardiac , the patient experienced no further EKG
changes.
2. Pump: The patient was on Lopressor and captopril , and his
blood pressure remained stable after his procedures. Echo on
2/10/04 showed an LVEF of 30% as well as akinesis of the mid
distal anterior wall felt in the entire apex. There was
hypokinesis of the basal anterior septum and the basal to mid
lateral wall with preserved function of the basal to mid inferior
and posterior wall. The apex is near aneurysmal. The patient
was put on heparin GTT given the risk of intraventricular
thrombus. The patient was started on Coumadin prior to
discharge.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient remained mildly tachycardiac.
His Lopressor was titrated up to 100 mg q.i.d. for rate control
but no concerning arrhythmias were noted on telemetry. His sinus
tachycardia was thought to be secondary to a bacterial pneumonia.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes. The hemoglobin
A1c was 10.57 demonstrating the patient&apos;s conservative treatment
was insufficient. He was started on NPH and insulin sliding
scale in the hospital. Metformin was started on 1/12/04 , and he
was restarted on Glucotrol before discharge. Diabetic teaching
was instituted.
5. Renal: Mucomyst was given before and after both of his
caths. His creatinine turned into his baseline of 1.2.
6. Heme: The patient was sent home on Coumadin given his
echocardiogram significant for near aneurysmal LV and a
hypokinetic apex. The patient will need to be followed in
Coumadin Clinic. Code status for this patient remained full
throughout his hospitalization.
7. Pulmonary: The patient was noted to be febrile and to have a
right middle lobe infiltrate on admission. The patient was
treated with five days of levofloxacin but remained febrile and
tachycardiac. The patient was started on azithromycin for a
total of five-day course. The patient defervesced after 24 hours
of being on azithromycin. Also of note , on a follow-up chest
x-ray prior to discharge , was read as the patient having a
question of a cavitating lesion in his right lobe. It was
recommended that this be followed up as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was discharged on following medications.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab sublingual q.5 minutes x2
doses p.r.n. for chest pain , azithromycin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x4
doses , simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , metformin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
1. The patient was instructed to call his cardiologist and
primary care doctor , Dr. Budd , within one to two days of
discharge. Dr. Osendorf is expecting the patient&apos;s call.
2. The patient is scheduled to go to the Coumadin Clinic at the
Opa Health within five days of discharge. Dr.
Callaway number of ( 733 ) 394-4873 was provided to the
patient and as well as the phone number for the Coumadin Clinic
at Tysco Oolwe Medical Center .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
erate global LV systolic dysfunction.
3. The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study
of February , 2003.
CC: Hypotension after dialysis
HPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for
hypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he
developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. He
denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. At Stodun Hospital ,
he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of
NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40.
ROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant
with meds , no melena , no BRBPR
Physical Exam T 97 p85 BP 114/67-&gt;160/97 rr 16-24 89% RA

Neck: Supple
Chest: Bibasilar rales
CVS: palpable S3 , Lat displaced PMI , II/VI SEM at RUSB , JVP &lt; 7cm
Abd: Soft NT ND , + BS , no HSM
Ext: Trace pedal edema , hyperpigmentation in sock distribution
Labs: WBC 5 , TnI 0.37 , CK 153 , CKMB8.2 ( chronically elevated cardiac
enzymes )
EKG: NSR , 1st deg AVB , LAE , LVH , old TWI in 1 , L , V5 , V6 , more pronounced
ST dep in V5 than 9/24
CXR: R pl effusion , CMG
Assessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI
upset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. The BP rose after
fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about
new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED.
Hospital course
1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta
blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His
cardiologist ( Dr Benisek ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable
myocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed only
scarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt&apos;s wife refused for him to go
for CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.
The results of the PET scan are as follows:
- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild
residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD
distribution.
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February ,
2003.
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with
cardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )
Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and
pending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.
Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry
2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. RA sats improved to
97%
3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. He was dialyzed to a weight below
his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. In the past he
has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The Ryi was
called by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. Slemp ) about his goal
weight.
4. ID: Blood cx were no growth
5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium
6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with
the cardiologist , Dr Ivrin
Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on
mornings of dialysis
Please adhere to your dietary restrictions. If you gain more than 3 kg
between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. The diet
guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Chapmed Gamette Medical Center

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mrs. Marnett is an 81 y.o. woman who presents with one day of
chest pain , difficulty speaking , nausea , and lightheadedness. She had
URI symptoms about two weeks ago and then 5d pta developed minimal
ly productive cough and then SOB for the past 2-3 days. She denies any
noctural dyspnea or increase in number of pillows. She lives alone ,
and a reverend checks up on her daily; the day prior to admission he
suggested she go to the hospital. She does not feel that she had any
speech difficulties at that time , but when she awoke she noted
heaviness of her tongue and workd finding difficulties. In addition , she
had sweating and chest pain that radiated to her shoulder ( L&gt;R ) , and
back. This was different than her usual anginal symptoms ( which do not
involve back radiation ). The pain was pleuritic in nature , and she
denied palpitations. She also noticed nausea and had several episodes
of dry heaving. While leaving the bathroom she had a single episode of
&quot;lightheadness.&quot; This did not involve any sensation of vertigo , or any
vision changes. She sat down immediately , and felt better within a few
seconds. There was no fall and no LOC. Around 8am , her housekeeper
came , and immediately noticed a change in Mrs. Cooney &apos;s voice. Mrs.
Solberg describes the change as a &quot;thickening of my tongue&quot; and some
problems finding words. She has been taking all of her medications as
prescribed over the last week.
ROS: On arrival to the floor , Mrs. Shoman noted a raised , painful
area on her L forearm. She does not recall any trauma to the area. She
denies any fever.

Hospital course by system:
Neuro: Speech difficulties: resolved by the time pt was in ER , making
diagnosis difficult. Possible etiologies include TIA or illness
exacerbating deficits from old stroke. Head CT in ER showed old
infarcts , but no acute process. Patient did not have any speech
difficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings.
CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes were
drawn. Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c of
some of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). Rhythm: pt was on telemetry for
first day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.
Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. Decision was made to
start antibiotics. Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikely
in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has a
history of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during this
hospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.
Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of
1.2-1.3. Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,
this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. Her
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute to
further ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and her
creatinine improved. However , after restarting her medications her Cr
again bumped to 1.8. Her UA was unremarkable. She was d/c home off
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that sh
e was still prerenal. The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3days
days , results to go to Dr. Skibo for monitoring and deciding when to
restart her medications.
MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hosp
for the first night. A radiograph was negative for fracture and it was
felt to be a small hematoma. The pain remitted with Tylenol. At
discharge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.
Heme: Anticoagulation. She was maintained on her home dose of INR was
maintained in a theraputic range. This will have to be closely
monitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. Her INR was 3 after 2
days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 days
after discharge , results to be followed by Sheldon Dingmann
Endo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd given
her worsening renal insufficiency. Fingersticks remained in acceptable
range ( 100-148 ) during admission.
Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). Pt will have weight
and BP checked qd. She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday and
Monday , and the results will be called to Dr. Benamati ( TERT VALLEY HOSPITAL CENTER ). She will
finish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left arm
pain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.
The visiting nurse is an important followup to your
hospitalization.Your diabetes medication was changed to glipizide -stop
taking the micronase. Your lasix , lisinopril and colchicine have been
stopped , don&apos;t restart them until Dr. Schoville tells you to restart. Your othe
medications are the same. Weigh yourself daily and if your weight increa
ses more than 2lbs in 2 days call Dr. Szesterniak
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. VNA will check BP and weight qd. Any BP &gt; 140/90 or wt gain of 2
lbs in 2 days will be called to Dr. Kempf ( BROTHERSCIAL GITER HEALTHCARE OF 703-958-5135 )
2. Thursday ( 20 of September ) and Mon ( 1 of April ) VNA will draw a Chem-7 and INR
and call results to Dr. Maria ( WA ASSPUNX HOSPITAL ); INR should be communicated to Blaine Lindquist at 731-463-2245.
3. Pt has followup appointment on 8 of September at 10:30am with
Dr. Speranza 4. There are 6 more days of Levofloxacin course.

Discharge Date: 8/9/1993
DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING ON
17 of October , BY DR. RAFALKO ,
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old male with
crescendo angina. The patient has a
long history of coronary artery disease and suffered an anterior
septal myocardial infarction in 1989. The patient did well on
medical management , until recently when he has developed increasing
fatigue and angina with decreased exertion. The patient had an
exercise stress thallium test on 16 of June , which showed ST depression
in V5 after 6 minutes and 38 seconds. The thallium aspect of the
test showed apical inferior reperfusion defect. A cardiac
catheterization in 18 of June , showed a 60 to 80% lesion at the left
anterior descending , 60% lesion of the first diagonal and 50%
lesion of the circumflex , 100% lesion of the right coronary artery.
Inferiorly , the heart was noted to be akinetic with areas of
dyskinesis. The ejection fraction was 45%. PA pressures were
32/20 with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm/HG.
The patient now presents with increasing angina , failing medical
therapy. The patient denied a history of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea , pedal edema. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times 14 years , status post
cerebrovascular accident left parieto-occipital hemorrhagic infarct
without any cognitive residual defects. The patient has a seizure
disorder since then , controlled on phenobarbital. History also
included hypertension , bursitis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY included
status post right knee surgery times 3 , status post patellar
fracture in 1958. ALLERGIES included Demerol , which produces
nausea and vomiting. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Cardizem-CD 240
milligrams by mouth each day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Lopressor 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
enteric-coated aspirin 1 each day discontinued 10 days prior to
admission , phenobarbital 30 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,
humulin 70/30 - 36 units each morning. FAMILY HISTORY was
significant for myocardial infarction. HABITS included a
90-pack-year smoking history , discontinued in 1989. Alcohol use
was discontinued in 1991.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a nervous , but pleasant
white male in no apparent distress. The
temperature was 97.7 , pulse 76 , respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure
136/84 , 98% room air saturation. Cardiac examination showed
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , gallops or
rubs. Neck was supple. Chest was clear to auscultation. Abdomen
was obese , soft , positive bowel sounds. Extremities showed pulses
intact bilaterally , no varicosities , no bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent the usual
preoperative evaluation , and was taken to the
operating room on 17 of October , for 3-vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting by Dr. Mcquerry The patient tolerated the procedure well ,
and initially recovered in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was followed by the Cardiology Service as is routine.
The patient&apos;s lines and tubes were pulled in the usual fashion at
the appropriate times. The patient was stable and was transferred
to the Step-Down Cardiac Surgery Floor. Postoperatively , the
patient developed atrial fibrillation , which resolved
spontaneously. postoperatively , the lower sternal wound had a
small amount of serosanguineous drainage and a small amount of
erythema. The patient was given a course of intravenous Ancef.
The patient received a total of 5 days of intravenous Ancef. The
patient was discharged home on 6 of February , tolerating a regular diet
and ambulating without difficulty. The patient&apos;s wound had cleared
up and was free of erythema or drainage. The sternum was stable at
discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were Tylenol #3 as needed ,
enteric-coated aspirin 1 each day , Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , phenobarbital 45 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,

dysfxn ( EF 60% ) , AS , AFib , DM , CRI , OSA p/w progressive dyspnea , fatigue ,
periph edema , weight gain. Admitted 3wks ago w/similar complaints -
was diuresed heavily w/~8lb weight loss
and symptomatic relief. Post D/C , did well for a
few days , then started developing progressive DOE ,
fatigue , orthopnea , as well as weight gain
of ~8-10lbs. On admission , she could not walk more than few feet w/o
SOB. Pt claimed that she was compliant with her medications and
practiced dietary
discretion. On day of present admission , pt presented w/CHF flare ,
acute
on chronic RF. In ED , BP 87/45 , P 75 , 96%RA , afeb. EKG showed AF with
no ST-T changes , enz neg. HCT 30.7 , BUN 105 , Cr
2.4 ( baseline Cr
~2.0 ) PE: AOx3 , resp distress , JVP? , S1S2 ,
3/6 AS murmur , trace rales , abd? , 3+ pitting LE
edema. Impression: 71yo woman w/CHF , AFib , AS , DM ,
CRI , w/hx of recent CHF exacerbation now p/w with
vol overload , dyspnea , and renal failure. Etiology of CHF exacerbation
unclear:she r/o for MI , no worsening of her afib , no si/sx&apos;s of
infection ,
no hx to suggest dietary indiscretion , medical non-compliance , lack of
medications CV:Isch- no evidence of ischemia: pt r/o for MI with
negative enzymes. PUMP: Pt was gently diuresed ~2L/day on Torsemide
100 IV TID x 4 days with excellent response and then switched to her
home diuretic regiment of 100 mg BID of PO torsemide and 5 mg PO
Zaroxolyn on the day prior to discharge still with good diuretic
effect. Her admission wt was 132.9KG and on day of discharge she
weighed 125.8kg: net total loss of 7.1 kg or 15.6 lbs per this admit.
During this admission , strict I/O&apos;s , daily weight. fluid
and salt restriction were maintained. She was not re-started on
Cozaar given BP&apos;s in low range with SBP:90;s. RHYTHM: chronic afib
w/good rate
control w/o agent and no rate issues during this admission. Pt is not
on coumadin given hx
of GI bleed. Pulm: Pt was continued on her Advair disk , flonase , prn
nebs. She was placed on CPAP @ night and did well with cpap;
arrangements were made for pt to have her CPAP at home changed to
hospital setting and equipment. HEME:1 )ANEMIA
Pt was admitted with HCT of 30.7 , lower then her normal. She had 3
positive stool guiaic&apos;s , low normal Fe
studies , and stable HCT during this admission. Her ASA was stopped 2/2
concern for GIB. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with her GI doctor , Dr. Ethan Wasowski 2 days after discharge.2 )THROMBOCYTOPENIA:pt had a drop in
platlets that was initially concerning , but ultimately appeared
to be lab variation with its resolution on the next blood
draw. RENAL:Pt was admitted with acute
on chronic renal failure felt to be secondary to decreased CO. Her CRT
elevation gradually resolved from 2.4 on admission to 1.8 at time of
discharge. Her celebrex was stopped 2/2 ARF.
Proph: Pt was placed on
Heparin 5000u SC BID for DVT prophylaxis and Nexium
40 GI:Pt was noted to have elevated LFT&apos;s on admission labs. Her peak
LFT&apos;s were ALT:368 , AST: 274 , AP:158 with nl BILIT 0.5 and biliD
0.3. DDX included congestion vs infection vs medications. hepatitis
deemed unlikely but hep panel still pending at time of discharge.
Since pt&apos;s LFT&apos;s did not resolve with excellent diuresis , it was felt
that it was not likely due to congestion. Most likely etiology was felt
to be reaction to drug. Pt was taken off the following hepatotoxic
meds: tylenol , statin , percocet , allopurinol. She was continued on her
tamoxifen , although case reports of hepatotoxicity noted; other
consideration included the neurontin , but lft&apos;s began to normalize on
medication. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with GI , Dr. Hornshaw 2
days following discharge. FEN: Pt&apos;s lytes were aggressively repleted;
she required significant K repletion each day and will be d/c&apos;d on K.
She was maintained on a NA and fluid restriction and placed on a
cardiac and diabetic diet. ( ENDO ): DM: Pt was initially placed on RISS
given concern for hypogylcemia and her home regiment was gradually
added to her inpatient regiment with elevated FS.
Pt was stable at time of discharge , sx&apos;s much improved , and scheduled f
or follow-up with cardiologist and CHF nurse on 8/28/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 )please stop the following medications: tylenol , percocet , Zocor ,
cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , aspirin
2 )follow-up on your liver enzyme elevations and guiaic positive stools
with Dr. Kemfort
3 )if you have any worsening shortness of breath , fatigue , lower
extremity swelling , or any concerning symptoms , please call your doctor
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 )follow-up for LFT elevations: hepatitis panel still pending at d/c
2 )follow-up for guiaic( + )stool and Hct drop
3 )The following medications were stopped during this admission given
concern re: elevated LFT&apos;s , ARF , and guiaic + stools: tylenol ,
percocet , zocor , cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , ASA.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Rodrick Lacher , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
GI bleed , V-fib arrest , status post stent placement and status
post ICD placement , CVA , DM , CAD , GERD , hypertension status post
CABG , status post St. Jude&apos;s MVR , hyperlipidemia , memory deficit ,
left-sided weakness and status post evacuation of left subdural
hematoma.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ):
The patient was admitted to IMH on 5/25/06. He had been behaving unlike
himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. The patient was found
to
be guaiac positive. A head CT showed no new lesions but did show
multiple infarcts that were known to be old. On 10/18/06 , the
patient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. This
clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.
Around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderline
hypertension for an unclear reason. His hematocrit was
stable. The patient&apos;s ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
were held. Also , the patient&apos;s Lasix was
held. On 8/19/06 at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient was
reportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. Soon
afterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having more
ectopy on telemetry. Soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient was
either found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen on
telemetry and a code was called. The rhythm was shown to be
V-fib. Chest compressions were initiated , and the patient was
shocked. Soon thereafter , he had two more shock episodes for
V-fib and was loaded on amiodarone 300 mg IV x1. Soon
thereafter , his V-fib terminated and subsequently , the patient
had an episode of slow PEA treated with atropine , epinephrine ,
calcium and magnesium. Code labs showed a potassium of 3.3. The
patient was intubated. A left femoral line was placed. The
patient was transported to the CCU with stable blood pressure on
neosynephrine. He was easily weaned off neosynephrine. The
patient does not have any history of an arrhythmia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient&apos;s past medical history is significant for:;
1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valve
replacement in 1999. In 2003 , the
patient underwent catheterization for unstable angina. The LAD
and D1 were stented. In 2004 , the patient underwent
catheterization for unstable angina showing restenosis of D1
which was re-stented.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. CVA.
4. Seizure disorder.
5. Subdural hematoma while on Coumadin , status post burr hole
evacuation.
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
The patient&apos;s medications prior to admission included:
1. Lasix 20 mg daily.
2. Toprol-XL 200 mg daily.
3. Lipitor 80 mg daily.
4. Keppra 1 g b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
6. TriCor 145 mg daily.
7. Zestril 20 mg daily.
8. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:
desquamating rash to phenytoin and also a possible
allergy to Ancef which occurred during this hospitalization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
On admission on 10/20/06 , the patient&apos;s vital signs were
temperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratory
rate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. He was not in any acute
distress. He was alert and oriented x3. He was interactive and
appropriate. Skin was normal. HEENT showed an old left-sided
facial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. The
JVP was 6 cm. There was no lymphadenopathy. The chest was
clear. Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no
extra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. Extremities
had 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurological
exam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. Otherwise , cranial
nerves II through XII were intact. The patient had 4/5 strength
on the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. Toes were
downgoing.
ADMISSION LABS:
Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucose
of 237 , hematocrit of 37.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
10/18/06 , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stool
performed by Dr. Marlin Shigo in the presence of Dr. Val Blache
On 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrest
performed by Dr. Monte Lenig with stent placement in the
circumflex.
On 4/22/06 , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. Danni
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and
mitral valve replacement. He was initially admitted for an upper
GI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrest
and found to have NSTEMI. His course in the CCU was as follows:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. The patient had a troponin elevation
beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMI
occurred
and then caused V-fib arrest. The peak troponin was 111.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,
and occlusion of the SVG graft. Two drug-eluting stents were placed
in the left circumflex. The patient was treated with aspirin ,
Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. The patient&apos;s beta-blocker and
ACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. The patient
was also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about his
liver function. At discharge , he is being restarted on his
outpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate.
B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causing
pulmonary edema. By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%
with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global
hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. The patient
diuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. His I&apos;s and
O&apos;s were followed. He was net negative , and he was discharged
at a weight of 87 kilos. The patient had an echo to evaluate
for dyssynchrony. This echo did not find significant evidence of
dyssynchrony.
C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned to
normal sinus rhythm. He received an amiodarone load as well as
amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. After he stabilized , the amiodarone was
discontinued after AICD implantation on on 7/1/06. The implantation itself
was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to
administration of prophylactic Ancef. The patient was switched
to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. His allergic
symptoms
resolved with one dose of IV Benadryl.
2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. A bleeding
vessel at the GE junction was clipped. The patient had a
transient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. LFTs were
followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization
and normalized before discharge. The patient was also maintained
on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.
3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red blood
cells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. His hematocrit remained stable therafter. The
patient was taking Lovenox as an
outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. During
the peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patient
was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin
drip for four days after device implantation. At that time , he
was restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.
4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual left
hemiparesis. These symptoms were stable. The patient was also
seen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficits
and abilities to make decisions. The Psychiatry team recommended
that the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge and
that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric
testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.
5. Pulmonary: The patient&apos;s pulmonary edema resolved with
diuresis.
6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated white
blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest
x-ray. This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl for
three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. During
hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade
temperatures on two other occasions. Cultures including chest
x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient was afebrile prior
to discharge. As of the day of
this dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative.
7. Renal: The patient&apos;s creatinine was elevated reaching a peak
of 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. The
patient&apos;s creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge
was 1.2.
8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.
Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to
mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.
9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH
22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. At the time of discharge ,
the patient&apos;s blood sugars were well controlled. He is being
discharged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet
dose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. Heart rate
70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. Oxygen saturation 96-98% on
room air. Weight 87 kilograms. Pertinent labs include a
creatinine of 1.2 , hematocrit of 36. The patient&apos;s exam showed
continuing left facial hemiparesis. Lungs were clear. Cardiac
exam was notable for a mechanical S1 , no extra sounds or murmurs.
His abdomen was soft , and the ICD placement site was well healed
without swelling , tenderness or erythema.

Discharge Date: 11/4/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lina is a 72 year old man who
is status post a coronary artery
bypass graft and mitral valve replacement who presents with
recurrent unstable angina. He was admitted to the Cardiology
Service for cardiac catheterization. His history began in l976
when he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness of
breath. In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction
and in October of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery
bypass graft with mitral valve replacement. He did fairly well
with no recurrent symptoms until September of l989 when he presented
with congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial
infarction. A thallium exercise treadmill test revealed
inferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medical
therapy. He did well until one to two weeks prior to admission
when he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and was
persistent for three hours after which time it was treated with
Nitroglycerin at Re Lalakety Wood,rank Hospital and resolved. An exercise
treadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath and
thallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apical
reperfusion abnormality. The patient subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization at Dentan Lascrople which
revealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and
patent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. His native
vessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his left
anterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtuse
marginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% right
coronary artery occlusion. Left ventriculogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. The patient was
referred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronary
artery bypass grafting was elected. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of an
asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Inderal , Procardia , Aspirin , Lasix , Pepcid ,
Maalox , Nitrol Paste , and intravenous Heparin. ALLERGIES: No
known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a
longstanding cigarette smoking history which was stopped in l98l.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant moderately obese male in
no acute distress. HEAD/NECK: Within
normal limits. CHEST: Clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate
and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema with good peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
bradycardia with first degree AV block and
right bundle-branch block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On July , patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting and a left internal mammary
artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively , the
patient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with several
episodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not felt
to be significant enough to warrant further investigation by the
Cardiology Service. The patient developed a blood culture that was
positive for enterobacter and the patient subsequently underwent
placement of a Hickman catheter to receive a four week dose of
Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone. This was well tolerated without
complication.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. The patient is
discharged home and will receive a full course of
four weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lopressor , and Pepcid.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. STATUS POST PTCA TIMES TWO.
3. SICK SINUS SYNDROME , STATUS POST PACER
PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72 year old woman
with coronary artery disease who
is status post PTCA times two with a sick sinus syndrome , status
post DDD pacemaker , and Hodgkin&apos;s disease who presented with
unstable angina. Her cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , family history , and past smoking history. She
had angina in April 1992 and underwent coronary angiography in
October 1993 which revealed an 80% RCA lesion , 70% OM , 70% mid-LAD ,
and 50% D1. The LV-gram was normal. She had a PTCA to the RCA
lesion with a 30% residual. She had recurrent exertional angina
one month later and a repeat catheterization at that time showed no
change. In February 1993 , she had several episodes of lightheadedness
and syncope which was felt to be secondary to sick sinus
syndrome. A DDD pacemaker was placed. She later had recurrent
chest pain at rest and again went to cardiac catheterization which
showed a 70% mid LAD lesion , 30% RCA , and a normal LV-gram with 75%
ejection fraction. She underwent PTCA to the mid-LAD lesion with a
20% residual. She was then discharged on Lopressor , Procardia , and
Aspirin. In February 1993 , she underwent an ETT , and exercised
4 minutes and 35 seconds on a standard Bruce stopping due to
shortness of breath and fatigue. No ischemic changes were noted.
She has done well until two days prior to admission when she
experienced recurrent angina at rest , and was admitted to
Tionwell Swellmo Hospital where she ruled out for a
myocardial infarction. She was discharged one day prior to
admission and on the day of admission had recurrent angina while
doing housework. She took three Nitroglycerins , and the pain was
relieved. Her primary physician recommended that she be seen in
he Emergency Room.

and the PTT was 57.3 ( possibly drawn off a line which had been
hep-flushed ). EKG: Sinus bradycardia at a rate of 59 , left axis
deviation , left ventricular hypertrophy , nonspecific T-wave
abnormalities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was continued on her Lopressor ,
Aspirin , and Nifedipine. Nitro Paste was added
on admission. On 3/30/93 , she underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed a 30% RCA lesion and a 30% proximal LAD. No other
lesions were seen. Her medications were continued except for
changing her Lopressor to Atenolol 50 mg q.d. She was monitored
over a weekend until she could have an exercise test. She had some

q.d. , Afrin and Imodium p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , erythromycin , levofloxacin , IV dye , iron.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old female with a history of
diverticulitis who presented with crampy
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting times several days. CT on
admission noted a diverticular abscess. CT was unable to drain it
due to its limited size. However , the patient continued to have
crampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. The patient was taken
to the OR on 10/19/01 for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoid
colectomy and colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was maintained NPO , with an epidural for pain control , until
return of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in the
colostomy bag.
By the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeled
walker. She was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain control
on 2-4 mg q.4h. of Dilaudid. Of note , the patient has a
significant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out MI
postoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. However ,
the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain on
postoperative day #3. A repeat rule out MI illustrated a troponin
leak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.
The patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order to
control rates with a good effect. The patient was also continued
on a course of IV antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , Flagyl and
Diflucan. Drainage from that particular abscess eventually
revealed enterococci , yeast and Pseudomonas responsive to these
antibiotics.

Discharge Date: 10/17/2001
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST STENT OF
THE RCA.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: EXTENSIVE CARDIAC HISTORY , DVT WITH
PE X TWO , CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ,
HEPATITIS B POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old male presenting
with unstable angina. His first presentation with coronary disease
was in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%
occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty
of the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill two
months later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis
of the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In October of
1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cath
revealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse disease
in the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuse
global hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed and
in 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,
and a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when he
presented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle
pulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workup
after this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of
epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no
additional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in July
of 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotal
occlusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDA
and the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months the
patient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked
by walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most often
the pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He denies
associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the
pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient denies
orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain at
rest. On February the patient underwent an exercise treadmill
test walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reaching
a heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chest
pain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina has
occurred with less and less exertion until the morning of
admission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest
tightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or
radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. The
pain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised
by his cardiologist , Dr. Raymond Merrihew , to come to the Emergent
Department. In the Emergent Department he was pain free and
received aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acute
changes. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs with
pulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of an
INR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. He is
now on Lovenox subcu for DVT prophylaxis. Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B
positive , and recent eye surgery in January of 2001.
ALLERGIES: Benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Avandia 4
mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,
gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , blood
pressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male ,
well appearing and in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive. Extraocular muscles intact. Oral mucosa are
moist. There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.
Neck is supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , without
wheezes or rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , nondistended ,
and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. There is no
rebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused , with
no edema.
INITIAL LABORATORIES: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,
bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose
253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,
mag 1.7 , CK 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , INR 1.1. EKG
reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorly
flattened T waves , with T in 1 , L in 6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continued
on heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On 10/21
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal
LAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right
PDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG to
OM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed in
the native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.
After the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was
transitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. An
echo was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with
moderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinning
and hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,
as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RV
was normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial
pressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastric
discomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific T
wave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise
treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his
troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having
some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that
had been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be low
yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the
interventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen was
maximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.
His cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of
0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on 3/10 and
walked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience
6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was considered
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , he
reached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80
during this submaximum stress test. The patient will be discharged
to home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. Devin Peachey He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see his
primary care physician , Dr. Panciera , for monitoring of his other
medical issues , including his diabetes. Discharge condition is
stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge
medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one
tab sublingual a.q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , ramipril 5
mg p.o. q. day , Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day x 70 days , Plavix 75 mg
p.o. q. day x 25 days ( a total of 30 days since the stent ) , Lipitor
10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Avandia 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Discharge Date: 10/18/2004
ATTENDING: WALLY TYLWALK M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 81-year-old female with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and
atrial fibrillation presents with nausea , vomiting , left lower
quadrant pain for one day and chronic nonbloody diarrhea on
6/23/04. The patient has had diarrhea for years , but this
episode was more severe and it was accompanied by nausea and
vomiting. Upon evaluation , she was found to have heme negative
stool. An abdominal CT showed a focal segment of colitis at the
splenic flexure with significant atheromatous disease of the SMA.
Findings were worrisome for mesenteric ischemia. As part of her
preoperative evaluation , she underwent a stress MIBI which showed
anterolateral , apical , and inferoposterior ischemia consistent with
three-vessel disease or left main disease. She does report
intermittent chest pressure and shortness of breath at rest and
with mild exertion over the past few years , increasing in the last three
months. She also reports two-pillow orthopnea and PMD. Given
these findings , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
6/11/04 as well as evaluation for celiac , SMA and IMA.
Catheterization showed 40% left main lesion. Otherwise , patent
coronary artery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7 in 9/15 ,
hypertension , question of COPD , depression , coronary artery
disease with an echo showing an EF of 45% on baseline inferior
hypokinesis.
MEDICATIONS:
Lasix , atenolol , bupropion , Fosamax , metformin , and lisinopril.
She has no known drug allergies.
On physical exam , the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of
72 , blood pressure of 132/61 , respiratory rate 20 , with an O2
saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiovascular exam was
remarkable for a regular heart rate with a normal S1 and S2.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam was
remarkable for quiet by all sounds. No tenderness and no
distention. Extremities had no edema , 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.
Abdominal angiography showed patent celiac SMA and IMA.
There was enhanced vascularity in the definitive or sliding
flexure but no embolic or angiographic cut off. The patient was
treated with NG tube to suction which improved his symptoms
although she cotinued to have.
LAB DATA: Remarkable for negative cardiac enzymes x3. Calcium
and magnesium , and potassium were repleted as needed. EKG was
unchanged with normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
Remainder of hospital course:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was started on mild Lasix diuresis for
shortness of breath with slight improvement in symptoms.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fracture of 50% with thick
aortic valve , thick mitral valve with trace MR , trace TR and
hypokinesis. There is severe baseline anteroseptal
distal-lateral apical hypokinesis and base posterior wall is
mildly hyperkinetic. Compared to report from 7/17 , LV
function appeared slightly worse. She was continued on aspirin ,
ACE inhibitor , beta-blocker , statin. She was mainly in normal
sinus rhythm but due to recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rate , she remained under rate control with
beta-blockers.
2. GI: The patient was n.p.o. with an NG tube to suction for the
first several days of her admission with resolution of nausea and
vomiting with continued diarrhea. Her diet was advanced to
clears and then a low-residue diet , which she tolerated
well. Her workup for chronic diarrhea included C. diff. , stool
cultures , fecal leukocytes , fecal fat , TSH , ESR , ANA , which were
all negative. Celiac sprue serologies were also sent and were
pending upon discharge. At this point , GI was consulted and the
patient underwent a colonoscopy and EGD. Colonoscopy showed
diverticula in the rectus sigmoid. There is overlying erythema
over the splenic flexure with shallow erosions suggestive of
ischemic colitis. Random biopsies were taken to rule out
microscopic colitis. EGD was unremarkable. Biopsies were
obtained and are pending to rule out H. pylori. Colonoscopy and
EGD biopsies should be followed up as an outpatient. Likely
etiology secondary to microscopic ischemia secondary to
malabsorption of celiac sprue.
:3. Infectious diseases: She completed a six-day course of
ampicillin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. On 6/11/04 , the patient
remained C. diff negative during the hospitalization.
4. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath likely secondary to pulmonary
process or underlying pulmonary disease in light of normal heart
function which should be followed up as an outpatient.
5. Endocrine: Metformin was held during the hospitalization
secondary to contrast administration. She remained on a regular
insulin sliding scale with adequate blood sugar control.
6. Renal: The patient was hydrated , pre and post di-loads with
unremarkable course of renal function.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on subcu heparin and
Pepcid.
The patient was stable , tolerating p.o. intake and p.o. meds.
She was discharged to rehab and will follow up with her primary
care physician and with cardiology and GI.

IMPRESSION: 58yo M s/p cardiac transplant c/b allograft vasculopathy ,
recent admission in 10/6 for pulmonary hemorrhage/PNA admitted with
increased SOB and hemoptysis. Likely CHF exacerbation +/- ILD +/- PNA
( CAP , atypicals , TB , PCP , fungal ). Patient&apos;s shortness of breath responded
to diuresis , and his symptoms improved. However bronchoscopy revealed
RML fresh blood , and CT chest is concerning for RML mass. Will need
follow up with pulmonary which is already arranged.
1. ) CV: No evidence of ischemia. Patient continued outpatient ASA ,
bblocker , statin , plavix. H/o cardiac transplant. Cyclosporine level on
10/27 was 152. His cyclosporine was increased during admission to 100mg po
BID. His sirolimus was discontinued.
PUMP- He was intially volume overloaded on exam. BNP on admission was 674.
He was diuresed with lasix 40mg po BID , and will be discharged on lasix
40mg po daily. Also given potassium 10meq a day , will need lytes
followed. His HCTZ was discontinued. Weight on day of discharge was
62.2kg. BP control with home regimen of dilt , lopressor , cadura.
2. ) PULM: Pulmonary was consulted. CT was negative for PE. He had a
bronchoscopy which was described above ( fresh blood oozing from RML ). BAL
was sent for multiple studies. PCP was negative , influenza negative , adeno
negative , viral studies , cultures , and cytology are pending at this time.
Galact Ag was negative. GBM antibody was negative. ANCA is pending.
Bronchoscopy and chest CT were concerning for RML mass. He will follow up
with a PET CT and Pulmonary appointment on 9/2/07. Allergy was consulted
re whether his symptoms could be an allergic pneumonitis ( given history of
ASA allergy , an previous desensitization , and they felt it was unlikely.
Rheumatology was consulted re possible vasculitis given new proteinuria -
thought unlikely although final consult recommendations were pending at
time of discharge. He will be discharged on oxygen given desat to 87% on
RA with ambulation. He will be treated empirically with levofloxacin x 14
day course to finish on 6/2/07 in case mass seen in RML is infectious.1

ATTENDING: WATERFALL , SAMMY M.D.
MEDICAL SERVICE: General Medicine Team He Drive , Ville Sas Oaksco
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quigg is a 42-year-old man with
history of diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
left Charcot foot complicated by recurrent cellulitis , who
presented with left lower leg swelling , erythema , and pain. The
patient does not recall having fevers at home , however , notes
that he &quot;get fevers all the time&quot; so he feels that he may not
have noticed. He did report that he had a temperature to about
101 and hemodialysis prior to admission for which he received one
dose of vancomycin. He denied having any symptoms of headache ,
chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , joint aches or
rash. He did endorse feeling fatigued with little energy. The
patient was referred to the Emergency Department given his
temperature of 101 at hemodialysis.
The patient has a long history of pain in his left foot secondary
to Charcot joint and chronic recurrent cellulitis including a
history of MRSA cellulitis. He has had numerous admissions to
SMC in the past year for treatment of the foot for which he
received several courses of antibiotics. He was treated from
10/5 through 10/24 with antibiotics posthemodialysis. At
the end of 10/24 , after returning from weekend away he had
severe exacerbation of the pain in his left foot with progressive
development of swelling on the bottom of his foot. At this time ,
he had extensive evaluation including an MRI of the foot and it
was felt that there was no evidence of osteomyelitis. His
antibiotics were discontinued at this time and he was discharged
to a nursing home for rehabilitation. He remained in the nursing
home from 1/18 through 5/22 and was discharged home two
weeks prior to admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes since the age of 23 , unclear if it is type 1 or type
2. The patient reports that he has a history of type 1 diabetes ,
but also reports that he had been without insulin for three years
after diagnosis. He does have consequent neuropathy ,
retinopathy , and nephropathy.
2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis since 7/17
3. Diabetic neuropathy in his legs bilaterally and Charcot feet
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1 ) ID-Given his presentation of L lower leg swelling and
erythema , Mr. Bock was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn in the
emergency department. An X-ray of his L foot revealed significant
fragmentation and erosion of the tarsal/metatarsal bases and
focal soft tissue abnormality in the plantar region concerning
for abscess formation and possible osteomyelitis in the setting
of known Charcot arthropathy as well as diffuse soft tissue
swelling extending along the calf. Given these findings , he was
ordered for an MRI. With his MRI pending and his L leg looking
somewhat improved , his Unasyn was discontinued on HD 3 and he was
started on Augmentin and his Vancomycin was continued given his
history of MRSA cellulitis in the past. He spiked a fever on HD 3
and again on HD 4. On HD 5 , he had an MRI under conscious
sedation ( was attempted prior to this , but pt unable to
tolerate ). MRI revealed 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneous
tissue of the plantar aspect of the left foot demonstrating
communication with the medial tendon sheaths and the ankle joint
with findings worrisome for abscess and osteomyelitis of at least
the medial malleolus , calcaneus , cuboid and talus. Infectious
disease was consulted and he was started on IV Levofloxacin and
IV Flagyl to cover gram negatives and anaerobes respectively and
his vancomycin continued to be dosed for level less than 20.
Orthopedics was consulted who performed an arthrocentesis of his
ankle as well as an arthrocentesis of the fluid collection at the
bottom of his foot. Ankle aspirate gram stain was negative , but
with 4+ polys. Fluid differential revealed &gt;160 , 000 WBCs. In
consultation with infectious disease , orthopedics , and the
patient , it was decided that the best course of action would be a
L below knee amputation given the extent of the infection. This
was performed on HD 8 by Dr. Miears He did have fever spikes
again on HD 8-9 and had repeat blood cultures which were
negative. An echocardiogram was performed on HD 12. While he did
have a tiny focal thickening of the aortic cusp , this was
reviewed with Cardiology and infectious disease and was not
though to represent a vegetation. He was afebrile x &gt;48 hours
prior to discharge. His surgical pathology returned with clean
margins on day of discharge , and as per ID consult service , he
does not need further antibiotics. He should have dry sterile
dressing changes to his residual limb daily. He may need an extra
dose of pain medication prior to this. If there is any evidence
of erythema or drainage , Dr. Fuller &apos;s office should be
contacted at 365-299-5817.
2 ) Renal-Mr. Merriweather was on the renal service and had hemodialysis
3 times a week ( M/W/F ) without complication. Of note , he is
awaiting kidney transplant from his sister and is followed by Dr.
Felix Zelle at NNH .
3 ) Heme-Mr Vaeth was on coumadin as an outpatient. We obtained
his hospital records from NUOM and a vascular study from 9/19
showed evidence of a DVT in the L internal jugular vein from
5/5 The details surrounding this DVT are not documented ,
however Mr. Tirona reports that his vascular surgeon told him
that he should remain on Coumadin. His coumadin was held prior to
going to the OR and he was placed on a heparin drip. His coumadin
was restarted after his BKA and he was bridged with heparin with
a goal PTT of 60-80. Prior to discharge , he PTT was 103 and his
heparin drip was decreased from 2100 to 1950units per hours. He
should have a repeat PTT checked on transfer to his acute
rehabilitation center with goal PTT 60-80. INR on day of
discharge was 1.8 , 1.6 day prior to discharge. His heparin drip
can be discontinued once his INR is therapeutic with goal of 2-3.
His INR will need to be followed every 2-3 days until stable off
of levofloxacin.
4 ) CV
Ischemia-Mr Grana was on gemfibrozil 600mg bid and lipitor 80mg
as an outpatient. His lipid panel was checked: TC 140 , TG 151 ,
LDL 82 , HDL 28. Given that his LDL was 82 and the risk of
rhabdomylosis on high dose gemfibrozil and lipitor , his lipitor
was decreased to 20mg. He should have a repeat lipid panel in 4-6
weeks. He was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduce
perioperative MI risk prior to his surgery. He reported that he
is not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and his
doctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high. This can be
readdressed as an outpatient.
Pump-Pt had elevated systolic blood pressures to the 160s in the
beginning of his stay. He was started on lisinopril which was
uptitrated to 5mg and also lopressor.
Rhtyhm-He had no evidence of arrythmias.
5 ) Endocrine-Mr. Rovella has DM which was diagnosed at age 23. It
is unclear if he has type I or II as he reported that he was told
he has Type I , but had a three year stint after diagnosis where
he was not on insulin. His FS on admission were elevated , likely
secondary to his infection and his lantus was uptitrated. He was
also started on prandial coverage. Prior to discharge , he was his
home dose of Lantus as well as Aspart with meals. He reported
that he already has an outpatient endocrinologist with whom he
will follow up. An HgA1c was 8.4.
6 ) Pain-Mr. Vanhee had significant post operative pain which
seemed to be mostly phantom limb pain. The acute pain service was
consulted and he was initially placed on a ketamine drip and
Fentanyl PCA. His fentanyl PCA and ketamine drip were
discontinued and he was started on oxycontin 80mg tid with
oxycodone for breakthrough pain. He was also started on Lyrica
for neuropathic pain. He was comfortable prior to discharge on
this current regimen. As his pain improves , he pain regimen
should be decreased.
7 ) Psychiatry-After learning that he would likely receive a
transplant from his sister , Mr. Potvin reports that he has had
significant anxiety prior to going for dialysis. Psychiatry
service was consulted who recommended low dose Ativan prior to
him going to dialysis.

four months , she experienced chest tightness and dyspnea on
exertion , and during the last month , her fatigue was extreme. The
patient was admitted on 7/22/96 to Missi.ell Hospital where an
echocardiogram revealed low-normal ejection fraction with severe
aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve area
was calculated on 0.8 square centimeters. Cardiac catheterization ,
performed in the same hospital , revealed an ejection fraction of
66% with normal pulmonary artery pressures , aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters , and gradient across the valve of 44 mm
of Hg. Native coronary artery disease showed 70% stenosis of the
left main , occluded left anterior descending , 50% stenosis of the
obtuse marginal , and 70% stenosis of the right coronary arteries.
The graft to the left anterior descending and to to the OM1 were
patent. The saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was
occluded.

Discharge Date: 11/2/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Atrial flutter. 2. Congestive heart
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure
and history of atrial flutter in September of 1998. The patient was
admitted to Cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter and
worsening congestive heart failure. The patient initially
presented to Aler Hospital in September of 1998 with
acute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. Chest x-ray at that
time showed congestive heart failure. The patient was initially
rate controlled with Verapamil and Digoxin and converted to normal
sinus rhythm. However , on Digoxin , the patient developed
junctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythm
after Digoxin was discontinued. Echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient was discharged on 11 of May
in normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged on Lopressor ,
Verapamil , Aspirin , and Coumadin , which was stopped five months
ago. The patient did extremely well after discharge until about
five days ago when he ran out of his Atenolol , which he had not
taken since then. Over the past week , the patient had extreme
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion , which steadily worsened. Today ,
the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few seconds
of chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. The
patient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms.
Upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short of
breath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness.
There was no warning or dizziness. The patient was brought to
Tien Medical Center Emergency Department. There , the patient was
noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. The patient was
given IV Lopressor , 5 mg , and his heart rate came down to 106.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A review of systems was positive for three
pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and increasing
lower extremity swelling over the past week. The patient denied
any fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history was significant for
high blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis ,
questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis ,
diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy with
ejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in September of 1998.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS
ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day ,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , which the patient self discontinued
five days prior to admission , Lisinopril 20 mg q. day , Aspirin ,
B12 , Folate , and Multivitamins. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient&apos;s
social history was significant for tobacco , one pack per day for
forty years. The patient quit in February of 1998. Alcohol was
significant for two to three drinks per day , with none since
September of 1998. There was no history of drug use. The patient
lives in Derdflintvo alone. The patient is a retired social worker.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient&apos;s family history was significant for a
mother with a myocardial infarction at 60 , brother with myocardial
infarction at 54 , and father who is deceased from cerebrovascular
accident.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile. The heart rate was 115 , blood
pressure 150/100 , and saturation 95% on 2 liters. In general , the
patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. HEENT
revealed the patient to be normocephalic , atraumatic. The pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. The extraocular movements
were intact. The oropharynx was moist. The neck was supple
without bruits. The chest was clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 1/6 holosystolic murmur. The
patient was in atrial flutter. The abdominal examination was
benign. The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There was no
clubbing or cyanosis. Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial
flutter at rate of 50 , as well as left axis deviation , right bundle
branch block , left ventricular hypertrophy with QRS widening , old
inferior myocardial infarction , and right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion ,
consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleural
effusions.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission showed sodium 146 ,
potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell
count 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , CK 95 , and troponin 0.05.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology floor
for treatment of atrial flutter and congestive
heart failure. The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. It was felt that the patient&apos;s worsening congestive
heart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. The patient was
started on Lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.
However , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor rate
control. Echocardiogram on 7 of September showed an ejection fraction of
30-35% with global hypokinesis. Of note , also , the patient&apos;s
ventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistent
with possible infiltrative disease. On 14 of October , the patient
underwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still in
atrial flutter and was not having good rate control. The patient
was successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm
afterwards. However , on 23 of May , the patient was still significantly
short of breath and hypoxic. This was felt probably likely
secondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on Lasix.
However , the patient underwent a VQ scan and was ruled out for
pulmonary embolism. The patient did well and , on 6 of April , the patient
experienced bilateral lip swelling , consistent with angioedema.
The patient&apos;s Lasix and Captopril were discontinued , as it was
unclear which agent had caused this , however , it was most likely
the Captopril. This responded well to Benadryl. The patient was
started on ethacrynic acid and Hydralazine for diuresis and
afterload reduction. The patient did well on this regimen. On
26 of February , the patient was discharged home in stable condition. The
patient was in sinus rhythm and was satting well on room air.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg
inhaled q. 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing , Enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q. day , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , Edecrin 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day , and
Benadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6 hours as needed for lip swelling.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Kotow
in one week. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with
services , to be followed by Aflintsa Mo Hendco VNA for blood pressure and
weight checks q.o.d.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: ROSARIO FREDERIC CYPRESS MD
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old male
who was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperative
testing he was noted to have an abnormal EKG. This prompted a
cardiac stress test , which was abnormal. He therefore received
additional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary artery
disease. He does have a history of atrial fibrillation in the
past , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to his
initially planned shoulder surgery. He therefore presented for
CABG rather than having shoulder surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. COPD.
5. BPH.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Nephrolithiasis.

10. Non-allergic rhinitis.
11. History of hepatitis in 1960.
12. Constipation.
13. Right-sided renal artery stenosis.
14. Renal insufficiency.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Left rotator cuff repair in 1991.
2. Tonsillectomy.
3. Thumb surgery in childhood.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking. He also
drinks approximately 2 beers per month.
ALLERGIES: Procainamide , which causes diarrhea and arthralgia ,
also verapamil , which can cause constipation.
MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION:
1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Propafenone 150 mg p.o. q.d.

5. Rhinocort Aqua 32 mcg q.d.
6. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , height 5 feet 10 inches ,
weight 102 kg , heart rate of 54 , blood pressure 130/88 in the
right arm and 142/88 in the left arm. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact.
Mucous membranes are moist. Oropharynx is clear. There are no
carotid bruits. Dentition is without evidence of infection.
Chest is free of incisions. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm. There are no murmurs. Pulses: Carotid , radial ,
femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+
bilaterally. Allen&apos;s test in the left upper extremity was normal
with using a pulse oximeter. Respiratory: The patient has clear
breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: There are no incisions.
Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds. Extremities: Are free of scarring , varicosities
or edema. Neurologic: The patient is alert and oriented. He
has no focal deficits.
LABS UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 ,
white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 ,
PT 16 , INR 1.3 , PTT 34.9. Urinalysis is normal. Cardiac
catheterization done on 8/28/04 revealed a 90% ostial LAD
lesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid D1 , 80% ostial D3 , 75% proximal
circumflex , 50% ostial RCA , 90% proximal PDA. There was right
dominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. He
had an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to hospital on
4/25/04 and was taken to the operating room on 10/19/04 where he
received a five-vessel CABG in which the left internal mammary
artery was sewn to the LAD. Saphenous vein graft 1 to first
diagonal artery. Right internal mammary artery was sewn to the
ramus. The left radial artery was harvested and sewn to LVB2 and
LVB1. Bypass time was 159 minutes. Cross clamp time 111
minutes. Postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensive
care unit where he was hemodynamically stable. He was rapidly
weaned of the ventilator without problems. He did develop a bout
of rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two days
postoperatively. This was treated by restarting the patient&apos;s
propafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrial
fibrillation. The patient&apos;s other primary issue postoperatively
while in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , near
anuria. A renal consult was obtained at this time. He did
receive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to be
essentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. He was started
on low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back to
his baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,
he began to make adequate amounts of urine. It was therefore
determined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependent
with him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. He remained
hemodynamically stable. He did have some constipation , which was
treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequently
resolved. He will be transferred out to the cardiac step-down
unit on 9/7/04.
The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.

Discharge Date: 8/16/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old Oriental male
with three vessel coronary artery
disease awaiting surgical evaluation. The initial onset of angina
was in 1972. He had a positive ETT with ST depressions in V5 and
V6. He had only rare angina since then treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin or rest. On 5/16/91 , he had a positive ETT which was
stopped secondary to chest pain. The EKG showed 2 mm ST
depressions in two , three , F and V4 through V6. He was encouraged
to have a cardiac catheterization , but he was reluctant to do this.
He has good exercise tolerance; takes long walks with his wife
without chest pain and swims for an hour a day. He had a cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission which showed 70% left main ,
100% left circumflex , 100% RCA and 90% LAD. PAST HISTORY:
Significant for GI bleed in the past. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol; Persantine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant man in no acute
distress. The HEENT exam was benign. The
neck was supple and nontender. The lungs were clear. The heart
exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm. Pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruits. The neuro exam was nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT: 58-year-old Oriental male with unimpressive symptoms
but strongly positive ETT and severe three vessel coronary artery
disease including left main at catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by cardiac surgery and
evaluated. He was taken to the operating room on
8/12/91. He had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with a
LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal , marginal
and PDA. Postoperatively he did very well with the exception of
24-48 hours of severe confusion and agitation after extubation
requiring four point restraints and Haldol. He gradually resolved
this by postop day #3 and began gently diuresing. His wound had
continuous oozing from the left thigh with no erythema or sign of
infection. This was continued on dressing changes.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged uneventfully on postop day #7 with
VNA follow up for his wound. FOLLOW UP will be with
Dr. Attaway in three weeks.

Discharge Date: 2/5/1991
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Rule out myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 39-year-old white male with
multiple risk factors for coronary
artery disease , including sex , weight , hypertension , smoking ,
positive family history and cholesterol. He had a four month
history of exercise induced crescendo angina with palpitations and
had an exercise thallium study done on the day of admission. The
results of this showed questionable evidence of ischemia. He was
able to exercise for nine minutes and 16 seconds with a heart rate
of 160 and a blood pressure of 166/84. His test was stopped for
mild chest pain of 3/10 and fatigue. There was no EKG changes
except for some APCs , PVCs and upsloping ST changes. A thallium
scan showed a fixed inferior defect and anterior redistribution on
a later scan; this was on a preliminary reading. The final reading
is pending at this time. After the study , he continued to have
waxing and waning episodes of chest pressure that were not
completely relieved with nitroglycerin. In the emergency room , he
was treated with metoprolol , sublingual nitroglycerin , heparin
drip and aspirin. ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a well appearing anxious man in no
apparent distress. The HEENT exam was
unremarkable. The neck was supple with a 0.5 cm nodule in the left
upper pole of the thyroid that is moveable and nontender. The
cardiovascular exam revealed no extra heart sounds or murmurs. The
lungs were clear. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The
extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema. He had good
distal pulses and no bruits in the femoral arteries post
catheterization. The wound was clean.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Cholesterol 285; serial CKs 112 , 81 and
66; T-3 149; T-4 6.6; TSH 1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He continued to have chest pain during the
evening with normal EKGs unchanged from
admission. Because of the continued nature of the pain , he was
placed on a nitroglycerin drip and given morphine sulfate which
controlled the pain. On the second hospital day he had a cardiac
catheterization of both sides of the heart which showed normal LV
function and normal coronaries per the cardiology note. He has
been free of chest pain since the procedure and has been taken off
of all of his medications.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged in good condition. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. p.r.n. pain. FOLLOW
UP will be with Dr. Lahaie , his cardiologist. Dr. Acuna has
been informed of the findings on cardiac catheterization , and the
patient has been instructed to call her after his meeting with the
cardiologist. He has also been advised to lose some weight and to
modify his diet in order to correct his hypercholesterolemia. Dr.
Yoo will follow up on the thyroid nodule and the high
cholesterol.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. RISK FACTORS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. TEN PACK YEAR SMOKING HISTORY ( INACTIVE ).
4. TONSILS AND ADENOIDS , ORAL SURGERY.
5. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.

ATTENDING: TRENTHAM , DEL GUADALUPE MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Klaja is an 81-year-old gentleman
whose chief complaint was abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had a
past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent
complex medical history including a septic right knee arthritis
with MRSA complicated by a PICC line-induced right upper extremity
DVT followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the course
ending on 11/11/2006. The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal
pain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucus
diarrhea , C. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on 1/24
Abdominal CT showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.
Blood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenem
as previously noted. However , since this discharge , the mild
abdominal pain persisted. He continues to have low-grade mucus
diarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chills
or anorexia. Over the last 2 days prior to this admission , the
diarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associated
again with fever or chills. He was brought into the emergency
department at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressure
of 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. At that time , he received volume
resuscitation with 2 liters of IV fluids , stool samples for C.
diff assay were sent. He received empiric therapy with p.o.
vancomycin. An abdominal CT in the emergency department showed
thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease as noted
with an anterior MI in 2003 , that had complicated to VT arrest ,
status post CABG in 2003 that was a left internal mammary artery
to LAD with saphenous vein graft to the PTA and obtuse marginal.
He has had a catheterization in 3/12 that showed patent grafts
and drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. He has chronic
kidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , C. diff colitis in 2003 , BPH ,
asthma , GERD , status post right upper extremity PICC-related DVT
and right knee septic arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: aspirin 81 mg , Plavix 75 mg , Coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,
Lasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg
daily , Flomax 0.4 mg daily and Flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He previously a smoker. He does not drink. He
is a nursing home resident.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , two
brothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. No family
history of cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals as previous noted , blood pressure
in the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. Patient was afebrile. Pertinent
physical findings included: Pulmonary: He had a prolonged
expiratory phase , but no crackles. Cardiovascular: Distant heart
sounds , regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No rubs or
gallops. Systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lower
sternal border. Abdomen: Obese , distended abdomen , left lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation. No rebound at this time.
Extremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremity
edema to the shins. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranial
nerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.
admission abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening in
the descending sigmoid colon and rectum. Chest x-ray showed
left-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs were significant for a white count of
15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and INR of 3.2. Electrolytes were
normal.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension and
infectious etiology. He was stabilized there and transferred to
the floor within a few days.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid
colon. Colitis was worse over the last month , associated with
diarrhea. Abdominal CT is consistent with an infectious
inflammatory bowel process. Given history of C. diff colitis , C.
diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were
possible. Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low
forward flow , given patient&apos;s cardiomyopathy and low ejection
fraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory
colitis or nonspecific colitis. Stool samples were sent for a C.
diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.
Stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during
admission. Empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.
Patient&apos;s abdominal pain continued to improve and completely
resolved. By discharge , patient remained afebrile and white
blood cell count decreased. Advance patient&apos;s diet as tolerated
and by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. We added
lactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sig
two days before discharge , showing resolving inflammation
consistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. The flex sig
did not change his management. We did discharge the patient on a
2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.
2. Coronary artery disease. Patient had no evidence for acute
coronary syndrome on admission. We continued his aspirin ,
Plavix , statin and beta-blocker. Patient had no ischemic issues
or coronary artery disease issues during his admission.
3. CHF. Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so a
gentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertension
and then as patient&apos;s blood pressure increased , was able to
restart patient&apos;s Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra
fluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. Also considered
restarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient
follow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,
once patient is fully recovered.
4. Chronic kidney disease. Patient had a baseline of creatinine
1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during
admission. He did not have any renal issues.
5. Hematology. Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , has
been treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how
along patient should be treated , given that the DVT was line
induced. Coumadin was therapeutic on admission , became
supertherapeutic in the MICU. Held Coumadin until INR fell below
3 , restarted Coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient&apos;s
normal dose. Patient was therapeutic on discharge. Will follow
up with primary care physician for Coumadin monitoring.
6. Nutrition. Patient was in the MICU and was n.p.o. given
abdominal pain and colitis. When transferred to floor , was
started on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. By
discharge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most of
the diarrhea had resolved.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy
during the admission that showed colitis consistent with
inflammatory etiology.
DIAGNOSIS: Patient had repeated negative C. diff toxin assays ,
but colitis was presumed to be C. diff and given history , could
have been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Patient
continued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged with
presumed C. diff colitis diagnosis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Included aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Plavix
75 mg p.o. daily , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o.
daily , Flovent 110 mcg inhale b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
lactobacillus 2 tabs p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
simvastatin 80 mg p.o. at bed time , Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. every
evening , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. every 6 hours x8 days at
discharge and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. every evening.
Patient had to follow up with primary care physician , setup for 2
to 3 weeks after discharge.

DEPRESSION.
RIGHT KNEE ARTHROSCOPY.
STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN 1994 AND 1996.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male
status post coronary artery bypass
grafting and sternal wound infection , admitted with 3 days of
increasing shortness of breath. The patient has had severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately
20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. He underwent
a 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein
grafts to the LVB , D1 and first obtuse marginal on 19 of October His
postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection ,
with debridement performed on 15 of May He was put on vancomycin
and sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin.
He felt okay , until 1 or 2 days prior to admission when he had
increased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. He also
complained of increasing orthopnea and a mild cough accompanied by
shaking chills the night prior to admission. He also complained of
mild upper and lower back pain. The patient denied dysuria. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY is as noted above. The patient has no known drug
ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were aspirin , 325 milligrams
each day , Captopril , 25 milligrams 3 times a day , digoxin , 0.125
milligrams each day , Lasix , 40 milligrams each day , Colace , 100
milligrams twice a day , NPH insulin , 35 units each morning , regular
insulin , 5 units each evening , metoprolol , 25 milligrams 3 times a
day , Niferex , 150 milligrams twice a day , Percocet as needed ,
vancomycin , 1.25 milligrams twice a day , Axid , 150 milligrams twice
a day , and KCL , 40 milligrams each day. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed
the patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker and
occasional ethanol drinker. He is retired secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He was able to ambulate and play golf prior to the
coronary artery bypass grafting in October .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was uncomfortable , tachypneic.
Vital signs were temperature 100.7 , heart
rate 97 , blood pressure 108/67 , 96% oxygen saturation on 4 liters
by nasal cannula. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination
showed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,
reactive to light , oropharynx benign. Neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy. Chest showed left base bronchial breath sounds
with egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.
Cardiovascular examination showed JVP approximately 8 centimeters ,
carotids were I+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 , S2 , very distant heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable.
Abdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. Skin showed the
upper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately
6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightly
tender and erythematous. Back showed no costovertebral angle
tenderness. Extremities showed the patient had TEDS stockings on ,
there was trace edema , II+ pulses bilaterally. Neurologic
examination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , and
the examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , SMA-7 showed sodium 135 ,
potassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate
22 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. CK was 13 , triponin 0.0.
Prothrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.
Digoxin level was 0.6. Complete blood count showed white blood
count 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8
eosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. Sputum from
27 of January showed 4+ Hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.
Chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate with possible effusion. Electrocardiogram showed left
bundle branch block. VQ scan was low probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease. The patient had a
maximum temperature of 102.3 on 27 of February He was
on vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. On 13 of June , gentamicin
and ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was started
secondary to decreasing creatinine. After his temperature spike on
21 of August , the patient&apos;s maximum temperature declined each of the
following days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. The
sternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued on
vancomycin for the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that grew from
the wound site on 15 of May The patient had a computerized
tomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternal
wound site and no abscess was seen. Thoracentesis was done on the
left pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with pH 7.51 ,
glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756
white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%
mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was
grossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria
and fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , no
polymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48
hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Given
his recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be
continued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also be
continued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization are
negative to date.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This was
performed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremity
noninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for
deep vein thrombosis. The patient&apos;s triponin on admission was 0.0.
The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial
dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive
heart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and
weight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresis
during hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior to
discharge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was
1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the mid 70&apos;s to low 80&apos;s. Captopril and
Lopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his
hospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose of
Captopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5
milligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior to
discharge.
3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN and
creatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and
2.6 on 20 of November Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on
9 of July , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had an
eosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of March , and subsequently
decreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.
It appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which
was discontinued on 24 of January It is unlikely that his increasing
renal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. More
likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to
decrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory values
will likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , as
well as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.
4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,
and has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resulted
in nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and may
benefit from counseling. The patient&apos;s decreased oral intake ,
nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying
depressive component over his prolonged illness.
5. Endocrine. The patient&apos;s blood sugar levels have been well
controlled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning. He has not
required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has
been discontinued for 2 days.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is fair. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE are Tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every
4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325
milligrams by mouth each day , Captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouth
every 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,
digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , Benadryl , 25 to 50
milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , Colace ,
100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , NPH insulin , 20 units
subcutaneously each morning , Atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times a
day , Ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as needed
for anxiety and insomnia , Lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twice
a day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rate
less than 60 , Niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,
Sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gram
intravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , Axid , 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day
times 7 days.
The patient will be transferred to Manhill County Hospital
on 5 of September He will have a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Andaverde
in approximately 2 weeks.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON THIS PATIENT:CAD
The patient is an 82-year-old female
with a history of myocardial infarction , diabetes , hypertension , high
cholesterol , coronary artery disease and colon cancer in 1980 status
post a right hemicolectomy who presented to Rosos Health Services
on 9/15/06 with progressively worsening shortness of breath and
some mild chest pain. She ruled out for myocardial infarction and then
underwent a cardiac catheterization at Gundette Medical Center that revealed
three-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient was then
transferred to the Ban Ma Hospital for cardiac
surgery. However , the patient and family refused cardiac surgery
and decided to undergo multivessel percutaneous coronary
intervention. The patient underwent stenting of the LAD and
diagonal lesions on 10/24/06 with Cypher stents with good
results. She was then admitted for an overnight observation
where she remained stable. Her creatinine remained stable at 1
and the plan was to undergo RCA angioplasty on Monday , 10/11/06.
The patient remained in the hospital over the weekend without
complaints or any problems and on Monday , 7/5/06 , she underwent
stenting of this RCA lesion with Cypher stent with good result.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Jerrold Koterba is a 78 year old
gentleman with known coronary artery
disease who underwent coronary artery catheterization one month
prior to the most recent admission , and was found to have two
vessel coronary artery disease. The medical treatment was
attempted following cardiac catheterization which has not
eliminated his angina. He was admitted to the hospital with
unstable angina after conservative therapy. On echocardiogram from
July , 1996 , he had a moderately depressed left ventricular
function and ejection fraction of 45 percent. Coronary
catheterization showed 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior
descending coronary artery , occluded circumflex artery , and mild
disease of his right coronary artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The patient is a well-appearing
78 year old gentleman. Head
and neck supple. No bruits over the carotid arteries. Heart , S1
and S2 are clear , no murmurs. The lungs with discrete wheezes over
both sides. The abdomen is soft , non-tender , benign , no
organomegaly. Extremities , no edema , no varicosities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting x two with reverse vein graft to the
second obtuse marginal graft and the left anterior descending
coronary artery on July , 1996 , the surgeon was Dr. Avenia The
patient&apos;s postoperative recovery in the Intensive Care Unit was
uncomplicated. The patient was extubated on the first
postoperative day and transferred to the Floor. Further recovery
on the Floor was not associated with any significant complications.
The patient regained a significant level of his preoperative
physical activity , and was able to be discharged out of the
hospital on May , 1996 in stable postoperative condition on the
following medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d.; Lasix 40 mg q.d.;

ATTENDING: EDMUNDO STEVIE BEDOKA MD
SERVICE:
The patient was admitted on the cardiac surgical service under
the care of Dr. Kyle Lennington
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Heldman is a 69-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis. He is status post CABG x1 and aortic valve
replacement in February 2004. He presented to the emergency
department prior to admission with shortness of breath. Chest
x-ray was taken that revealed pulmonary edema. Stated he had
been complaining of shortness of breath over the month prior to
admission with no dyspnea on exertion or chest pain. While in
the emergency department , he had respiratory distress with O2
oxygen saturations 69%. An echocardiogram was done at that time.
It was significant for showing evidence of a dehiscence of the
bioprosthetic aortic valve with prolapse into the left
ventricular outflow tract. It was noted that there is at least
moderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation. It also noted mitral
valve had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. As stated
previously , he was admitted to the cardiac surgical service for
repair/replacement of his aortic and mitral valves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

6.11 , hematocrit 28 , hemoglobin 9.5 , and platelets 98 , 000. PT
14.8 , INR 1.1 , PTT 42.2. Arterial blood gas showed pO2 of 64 , pH
7.38 , PCO2 of 52 and the base excess of 4. Cardiac
catheterization data on 6/29/04 , coronary anatomy , 10% proximal
LAD , 5% proximal circumflex , 85% mid RCA with a codominant
circulation. ECG on 11/29/05 shows first-degree AV block with
left anterior hemiblock with inverted Ts. Chest x-ray on
1/28/05 consistent with congestive heart failure.
Brachiocephalic and right subclavian stents were in place.
HOSPITAL COURSE
BRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE:
Date of surgery , 2/18/05.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
See magna valve three months prior. EPL on echo showed grossly
mobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , MR. No
vegetations.
PROCEDURE:
Reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valve
replacement , #24 homograph , MVP with Alfieri suture.
BYPASS TIME:
355 minutes ,
CROSSCLAMP TIME:
265 minutes.
One ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal
tube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes were
placed.
FINDINGS:
Dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium ,
especially periaortic. Right axillary cannulation with 6 mm
Hemashield side. Percutaneous right CF decannulation.
Uneventful re-sternotomy.
Previous SVG PDA injured during dissection , repaired with
interrupted 7-0 Prolene. Aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 of
circumference with question of an abscess cavity near LCC/RCC
junction. Debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatory
tissue. Previous Dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocket
of pus on the anterior aspect. No. 24 allograft placed with
double layer proximal suture line. SVG and both coronary
arteries implanted as buttons. Distal suture line continuous 4-0
Prolene. Transaortic and mitral valves replaced.
After the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiac
intensive care unit in stable condition. His postoperative
course was complicated by the following:
1. Infectious disease: Although , Mr. Ownbey had multiple blood
cultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date of
discharge. Although Mr. Cavitt was never felt to be bacteremic ,
the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of the
aortic valve prosthesis. This never showed the organisms
identified on Gram stain and MSSA stain. However , the infectious
disease physicians were consulted and felt that Mr. Sanjurjo should
be on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. As at the time of
discharge , Mr. Bersamin has finished his regimen of gentamicin and
will continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until
11/12/04. The rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin he
will get after dialysis three times a week. While an inpatient ,
Mr. Rakus never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia.
2. Cardiovascular: Ms. Johe was noted to have a first-degree
AV block on postoperative day #7 with a PR interval of 0.35. Up
into this point he had been receiving labetalol. This was held
and the electrophysiology consult was obtained. The
electrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be an
excellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. Initially they
attempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian.
However , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtain
access through the left iliac. His permanent pacemaker was
placed on 10/3/05 and was interrogated the following day and
felt to be functioning appropriately. He was restarted on his
labetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms.
Other than the above , Ms. Dingman was weaned from his oxygen
requirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. All epicardial
pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication.
He will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100
mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o.
6 hours p.r.n. pain , rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. , vancomycin for
which he will receive following dialysis until 2/28/05 , Zocor 40
mg p.o. q.h.s. , losartan 100 mg p.o. daily. Mr. Llanez will
follow up with Dr. Owston , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks , and Dr.
Geister , cardiologist , in three to four weeks , Dr. Kmiecik , the
patient&apos;s primary care physician , in one to two weeks and Dr.
Vaught , cardiologist , in two weeks.

ATTENDING: BURT EVERETT PENISSON M.D.
DISCHARGE DATE: To be determined.
SERVICE: GMS Ra
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Failure to thrive.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , postherpetic neuralgia , atrial fibrillation , and urinary
tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation status
post pacemaker placement , and chronic venous stasis who presents
with nausea , vomiting , and failure to thrive. The patient was
recently admitted to Tapo Waycent Smouthnew Community Hospital in early
October with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lower
extremity cellulitis. She was treated with diuresis ( ultimately
with ethacrynic acid as she developed a rash on torsemide and
itching with Lasix ) and a seven-day course of levofloxacin. At
the end of this admission , she was sent to a rehabilitation
facility. The patient had returned on the day of admission to
see her primary care physician. She had been vomiting and
appears severely dehydrated. She reported nausea and vomiting
for eight to nine days , intermittent nonbloody , nonbilious. She
also reported dysphagia for the last two months. She describes
recent dysuria. She also states that she has had no bowel
movement for a week prior to admission. She has had flatus. She
also complains of a baseline right ear pain due to her
postherpetic neuralgia. She has significantly decreased p.o.
intake with increasing generalized weakness. She denies chest
pain or shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , T6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zoster
with postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear ,
atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history of
guaiac-positive stools.
MEDICATIONS: Colace , senna , lisinopril 5 mg q. day , Lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , OxyContin 10 mg
q.12h. , calcium 500 mg t.i.d. , Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. , Fosamax
70 mg q. week , Protonix 40 mg q. day , and ethacrynic acid 25 mg
b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Lasix , torsemide , penicillin , erythromycin , capsicum ,
and quinidine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Recently at the Orva Sonapa Alblands in
ME , otherwise , lives alone in Rham En Ma At baseline is
ambulatory with a walker. Remote history of tobacco , quit 50
years ago. No history of alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Asthma and heart disease in three brothers.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 96 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 119/56 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 99% on
room air. The patient is alert , but uncomfortable and ill
appearing. HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact. Mucous membranes are dry.
Oropharynx is otherwise clear. There is ptosis of the right lid
( baseline ) and exquisite tenderness over the right base and right
ear. Neck: JVP is 7 cm. Neck is otherwise supple with no
tenderness to palpation. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. Foley in place
draining a dark , cloudy urine. Extremities: Violaceous skin
changes of the legs bilaterally. 2+ edema. There is an area of
erythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence of
infected ulceration. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Cranial
nerves intact ( except right lid ptosis ). The patient did not
feel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , but
her strength was symmetric throughout.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a chemistry panel within
normal limits. BUN was 22 , creatinine 1.1 , white count was
13.27 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 448 , 000 , ALT 25 , AST 35 ,
alkaline phosphatase 339 , total bilirubin 1.0 , albumin 4.0 ,
amylase 39 , and lipase 14.
IMPRESSION: An 87-year-old female presenting with nausea ,
vomiting , and dehydration as well as dysuria , most likely mainly
due to urinary tract infection secondary to chronic Foley
placement.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: No acute issues. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker. No aspirin was given , as the patient is on
Coumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.
b. Pump: The patient was dry on admission in the setting of
nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. Her last echo
showed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,
mild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear
etiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrial
pressure ). Initially , the patient&apos;s ethacrynic acid was held
given dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her
admission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a
slightly negative fluid balance. The patient was also continued
on her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequately
hydrated for blood pressure control.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She has a pacer placed and is V-paced. She is on
Coumadin with her INR at goal.
2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky
opacity of the right lung base possibly representing an
infiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.
The patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung
exam clear ).
3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior
to admission with decreased p.o. intake. She also reported no
bowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. A KUB was
obtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or
free air. The patient was given stool softeners and laxatives
p.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. She was
continued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease. The patient&apos;s nausea and vomiting improved overall
throughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.
There is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was
thought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,
which were increased early on in her hospitalization to address
her postherpetic neuralgia. The patient&apos;s nausea improved with
Reglan. Nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.
The patient had significantly better p.o. intake. The patient
also complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,
this occurred mainly with solid foods. Per Speech and Swallow ,
the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid diet
and is concerned for an obstructive lesion. A video swallow was
obtained on 3/4/05. This study showed no aspiration and normal
passage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was
made of cricopharyngeal prominence ). Speech and Swallow
recommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patient
has tolerated well. The patient has a history of an elevated
alkaline phosphatase ( with elevated GGT ) of unclear etiology.
Abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in October 2005
showed gallstones , but no other process to explain the
abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. The patient had no right
upper quadrant pain on this admission.
4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenous
fluids for dehydration. She was also found to have a urinary
tract infection and was initially started on levofloxacin
empirically. The urine culture returned was Staph aureus ( the
patient has had indwelling Foley ) and the patient was switched to
doxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,
and erythromycin ). Blood cultures were negative. The patient
has been afebrile through this admission. She was also noted to
have a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt was
made to remove her Foley catheter. This was thought most likely
due to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.
The patient will be discharged to rehab with her Foley in place
and is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Urology on
October , 2005.
5. Neuro: The patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting her
right face/ear. She was admitted on OxyContin and oxycodone ,
which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortable
and Neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.
Given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient&apos;s opioid
medications were decreased. A trial of a lidoderm patch on the
affected area was attempted prior to discharge.
6. Heme: The patient&apos;s INR was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on Coumadin for
her history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was on Nexium and Coumadin.
8. Code status: DNR/DNI.
9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility. She will follow up with her primary
care doctor Dr. Eddie Nitterhouse In addition , an appointment has
been made for her to see Dr. Nang on January , 2005 at 9:30
a.m. In addition , an appointment has been made with Dr. Storch
in Neurology on October , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requested
that the patient&apos;s basic metabolic panel be monitored while she
is on ethacrynic acid. In addition , her weight should be
followed daily to check for fluid accumulation. She will also
benefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. The
patient is stable at the time of this dictation.
The discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to this
discharge summary.

ATTENDING: VANHESE , SAMMY M.D.
This is a discharge summary dictation addendum to the previously
dictated note dictated by Rocky Skorski , PA-C , describing
Mr. Yandow &apos; preoperative history , physical , operative procedure
( CABG x3 ) on 8/9/06 and postoperative course from 8/9/06
through 1/13/06.
While on the cardiac surgery step-down unit , Mr. Doncaster continued
to demonstrate swollen ecchymotic area at the left lower extremity
along the SVG harvest site incision with white blood cell count
rising to 15.6 on 10/25/06 , although remaining afebrile. A left
lower extremity ultrasound obtained at that time revealed a fluid
collection along the prior SVG tract , corresponding to the area with
the most significant erythema. Mr. Tixier was continued on
vancomycin and levofloxacin and was taken back to the operating
room on 9/6/06 for drainage and irrigation of left lower extremity
endoscopic saphenous vein harvest site. No obvious purulence was noted
in the operating room. Cultures were sent from the OR which
subsequently revealed no growth. Postoperatively , the wound was
packed with wet-to-dry dressing , changed daily , and the patient
was continued on vancomycin IV antibiotics with white blood cell
count improving. Following operative reintervention , SVG harvest
site incision appeared less inflamed , less tender and less erythematous ,
with corresponding improvement in cellulitis. A plan had been made to
subsequently discharge the patient on postoperative day #13 , 5/2/06.
A long line was placed at this time in anticipation of discharge for
continuation of seven days of IV vancomycin. However , white blood
count rose to 19.4 on planned day of discharge , 3/28/06 , and ,
althought the patient remained afebrile and the wound continued to
remain clean with minimal cellulitis , Mr. Obanion was kept inpatient
overnight for continued observation and re-assessment of WBC. On
3/25/06 , white blood cell count improved to 14.3 , the patient
remained afebrile , and the wound continued to remain clean with
packing changed wet-to-dry daily. Additional sources of leukocytosis
were sought including sputum culture , which subsequently demonstrated
no significant growth. Urinalysis was noted to be mildly dirty , for
which the patient began a short course of p.o. levofloxacin.
Sternal wound continued to remain intact with no sternal click ,
erythema , or drainage noted. Mr. Sustaire is discharged to
rehabilitation today , postoperative day #14 , for continued
cardiopulmonary rehabilitation following coronary artery bypass
graft x3 and drainage and irrigation of left extremity saphenous vein
harvest site.
PROCEDURES:
1. 8/9/06 , CABG x3 with LIMA to LAD , SVG1 to PDA , SVG2-OM1.

ATTENDING: BRADLEY ZENI MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath , hematuria.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with
a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in
LVH , recently discharged from Longlate General Medical Center on 7/10
and subsequently transferred to Ieu University Medical Center The patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. The prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). The patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. However , over the past 2-3 days the
patient developed increased shortness of breath , and dyspnea on
exertion with very minimal movement. The patient reports stable
two pillow orthopnea. No upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. The patient without palpitation.
The patient does report that shortness of breath was increased
over past baseline. The patient also notes noted increased
hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for
over 1-2 years per patient. The patient does report that he had
a Foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. The patient denies chest pain.
The patient was felt to have &quot;crackles&quot; at the rehab , and was
sent to the Ridwill Child for further care. In ED
the patient was afebrile , heart rate of 74 , blood pressure
127/75 , and satting 95% on room air. He was given 80 IV Lasix ,
Percocet and Lactulose for elevated ammonia. Labs were notable
for elevated BNP of 655 , elevated ammonia of 83.

ALLERGIES: Ciprofloxacin , Codeine causing rash and dizziness.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with wife. No tobacco or
alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile with a heart rate
of 82 , blood pressure 132/72 , respiratory rate 94% on room air ,
weight 420 lbs. General: Morbidly obese , speaking in full
sentences. HEENT: Oropharynx clear , anicteric sclerae. Neck:
JVP less than 6 cm though difficult to assess secondary to
habitus. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: RRR , no MRG , no
S3 or S4 appreciated. Lungs: Increased crackles at the bases.
Abdomen: Obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave.
Extremities: Lower extremity edema approximately 2-3+. Skin:
The patient with chronic excoriations on abdomen ( the patient
reports they have been improving over the past year ) , and the
patient also with chronic ulcer/lesions throughout lower legs
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3.
Motor strength someone decreased proximal leg and arms.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2
26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal
limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymes
were negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.
INR 1.2 , PTT 36.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKG
first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renal
ultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )I revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ETT MIBI on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed
2/25/03 revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive
MIBI in 10/10 The patient with no EKG changes , and also no
chest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. On 8/25/03 the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described MIBI. At that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on 3/28/03 and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up with
Cardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patient
with elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). It was felt that the patient&apos;s shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,
the patient&apos;s Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing an
EF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased Lasix dosing. On 1/24 the Lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient&apos;s creatinine began to rise.
Creatinine normalized to patient&apos;s baseline on 10/14 At time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary to
the elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. The patient&apos;s NPH was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient was
continued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).
The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from past
admission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.
A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
LFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. The
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
The patient&apos;s medication of Lactulose was continued.
6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal
gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologist
attending , Dr. Burrows , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient&apos;s multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workup
was performed.
PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. The
patient to follow up with Cardiology , PCP and Urology. Continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Syncope.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year-old man with
diabetes , hypertension , obesity and non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma of the
right hip on chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) , which began on 11/29/06 and
will continue for 18 weeks. He reported no complications from
ischemic chemotherapy. At baseline he cannot bear weight on his
right leg and he devised this complicated system where he shifts
himself down the stairs to the bottom of the steps using his
upper body strength and a family member to assist him. All
during this maneuver he felt unusually short of breath the day of
admission and in the context of breathing heavily began to sweat
and feel lightheaded and then lost consciousness temporarily.
Sister was present and called EMS. On arrival to the emergency
room , he was hypotensive and received IV normal saline as volume
resuscitations. His pressures initially were noted to be in the
70s to 80s systolic and improved to 90 systolic after 4 L of
fluid from the emergency room. The patient was admitted for
syncope. On admission as part of the workup for syncope an
initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam , the patient was
afebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure systolic 100 ,
respirations 20 and O2 sat 94% on room air. Pupils were equal ,
round and reactive to light. There was no cervical
lymphadenopathy. JVP was not visualized due to large neck.
Lungs were clear. The heart was regular. There was an S1 , S2
with a loud and widened split P2 component of the second heart
sound. Abdomen was soft and nontender. The right hip was tender
to palpation. The extremities had 1+ edema bilaterally.
The patient was admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of syncope.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The second set of cardiac enzymes was positive
with a troponin of 2. Echocardiogram the morning following
admission showed a dilated right ventricle consistent with right
ventricular strain. This was followed by a PE protocol CT scan ,
which showed a large saddle embolus. The patient was treated
initially with IV heparin , transitioned to Coumadin and then the
decision was made to try Lovenox therapy for long-term
anticoagulation. Cardiac enzymes normalized. Repeat
echocardiogram showed mild improvement in right heart function.

Discharge Date: 7/22/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a morbidly obese , 53
year old , white male who presented
with new onset chest pain and melena. He had been in his usual
state of good health and was without known cardiac risk factors.
The night prior to the night of admission , while walking from the
bathroom to his bed in the heat , he developed new chest tightness
which he described as somebody sitting on his chest. He had
shortness of breath and diaphoresis but no nausea , vomiting ,
palpitations or radiation. He returned to this bed , and the pain
resolved after several minutes of rest. He was without further
episodes until the night of admission , when walking to work he had
2-3 episodes of chest tightness similar to the night before. Each
of them lasted at most 10-15 minutes. He went to the Mapark Hospital emergency ward for evaluation. He denied any pain
like this previously. He denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or
orthopnea but did have daily ankle swelling for the past five
minutes and some new shortness of breath after walking 200 yards
over the past 5-6 months. He also reported two episodes of black
loose stools , one 2-3 weeks prior to admission and one on the night
of admission. He had some transient abdominal discomfort 2-3 weeks
prior to admission which he treated with ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. to
q.i.d. for 3-4 days. He had no recent abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , hematemesis , hematochezia or coffee ground emesis. He
was without history or family history of peptic ulcer disease. He
was without recent weight loss or gain. He has had long time
ingestion of 6-8 beers a day but no recent binges. He took four
Excedrin the day prior to admission for a headache. An NG tube in
the emergency ward showed bilious material which was guaiac
negative. He denied fevers , chills , cough , sputum , dysuria ,
obstructive urinary symptoms , headache , visual changes ,
paresthesias , early satiety or bleeding diatheses. PAST HISTORY:
Chronic nasal congestion; right sciatica. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: Sudafed p.r.n. ALLERGIES: None known. FAMILY
HISTORY: Mother died of cancer; father died of &quot;heart failure&quot; in
his late 60s. No family history of diabetes mellitus or
hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY: He smoked four and a half packs of
cigarettes per day times 15 years; quit 15 years ago. He drinks
6-8 beers a day. He lives in Alabama with his wife and three
of his seven adult children. He has three small grandchildren. He
works the night shift as a fork lift operator for the post office.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a morbidly obese man in no
apparent distress. Pulse 84 and blood
pressure 142/80 lying; pulse 86 and blood pressure 150/100 sitting;
respirations 26; afebrile. The head was normocephalic and
atraumatic. The extraocular muscles were intact; pupils equal ,
round and reactive to light; conjunctivae clear. The oropharynx
was clear. The neck revealed full range of motion; no thyromegaly;
no masses; unable to evaluate JVD secondary to a thick neck. There
was no CVA or spinal tenderness. The chest was clear to
auscultation and percussion; decreased breath sounds throughout;
barrel chest. The cardiovascular exam revealed a nearly inaudible
S1 and S2; no murmurs audible. The abdomen was soft and
protuberant; nontender; normal bowel sounds. The extremities were
without clubbing , cyanosis , clear edema or calf tenderness or
swelling. The neuro exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam revealed
black and maroon guaiac positive stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Hematocrit 37.0; white blood cell count
17.2 with 75 polys , 1 band , 18 lymphs , 4
monos , 2 eos; platelets 439 , 000; sodium 136; potassium 4.4;
chloride 104; CO2 23; BUN 60; creatinine 2.0; glucose 168; calcium
10.2; phosphate 3.8; protein 7.3; albumin 4.6; AST 37; ALT 23; LDH
271; alkaline phosphatase 87; cholesterol 210; triglyceride 226;
CPK 72 on admission. The chest x-ray showed fat in the
mediastinum , normal heart , no infiltrate or effusion. A KUB showed
no obstruction or free air. A tagged red blood cell scan in the EW
was negative for bleeding source. The EKG showed a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 90; frequent PVCs; intervals 0.15 , 0.07 and
0.39; axis 40 degrees; flipped T wave in L; flat Ts in V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: #1 ) Angina. The patient was admitted with a
story classic for angina. He was admitted for a
rule out MI protocol. His EKG remained essentially unchanged. He
was noted to be in bigeminy and had some frequent PVCs on several
EKGs and on monitor , however , his EKG remained unchanged except for
some labile T waves in the lateral lead which changed with lead
placement. He was ruled out for an MI with CPKs which actually
went up from a CK of 72 to a peak of 331 , but on electrophoresis
there was no MB fraction found. The bump in the CK level was felt
to be secondary to multiple attempts at a central line placement in
the EW and skeletal muscle trauma. He was treated with sliding
scale Nitropaste and nifedipine for blood pressure control in the
hospital. An echocardiogram was done to assess left ventricular
function which revealed no regional wall motion abnormality , some
slight decrease in compliance but good LV function. An exercise
tolerance test could not be completed secondary to his sciatica.
On ETT he went for one minute and 44 seconds with a heart rate of
81-122 , blood pressure 136/80 to 144/80. There were no ST changes
noted. There were some asymptomatic VPBs and no chest pain. He
was discharged on Procardia XL 30 daily and given a prescription
for nitroglycerin and instructed on how to use this. #2 ) GI
bleed. He was admitted with melena and a falling hematocrit. A
hematocrit drawn at EH in January was 48 and on admission here was
37 and dropped to a low of 28. He received three units of packed
red blood cells in the hospital. An endoscopy on 2/6/90 showed
two small ulcers in the prepyloric antrum , one measuring 3 mm and
the other 5-6 mm. Both were superficial and benign appearing at
the time , and neither had stigmata of a recent bleed. Biopsies
were taken with good hemostasis. No varices or esophagitis were
noted. The GI bleed was presumed to be secondary to his ulcer
disease. He was treated during the hospitalization with an H2
blocker which was to continued for 8-12 weeks after discharge. He
was instructed to not take aspirin or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or to drink alcohol after discharge. The
discharge hematocrit was approximately 35 and remained stable. #3 )
Leukocytosis. He was noted to have a leukocytosis without bands on
admission. This resolved with hydration and was felt to be most
likely secondary to stress reaction. #4 ) Sleep apnea. He was
noted to be apneic at night by the nurses with sinus bradycardia
and sinus pauses during the apneic episodes. He had one sinus
pause at seven seconds. On the third night of admission , he was
monitored on a sat monitor overnight which noted him to desaturate
to the 60% and 70% range during his apneic episodes. He was
presumed to have sleep apnea and will be worked up as an outpatient
with a sleep study per Dr. Mittleman #5 ) Renal. He had an
increased BUN and creatinine on admission. This decreased with
hydration. The discharge BUN was 23 and creatinine 1.1.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
COMPLICATIONS: None. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
Pepcid 40 mg p.o. daily; Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. daily;
nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. chest pain. FOLLOW UP will
be with his internist , Dr. Carbonaro , and with Dr. Mirabile in eight
weeks for a repeat endoscopy and with Dr. Cirillo for a sleep study.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. NEW ONSET ANGINA.
2. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
3. SLEEP APNEA.

diagnosis , aortic stenosis. Postoperative diagnosis aortic
stenosis. Procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve. Bypass time was 59 minutes ,
cross clamp time was 48 minutes. Two atrial wires , one
ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tube
replaced. Findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve.
Weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heart
block. A wires and V wires were placed. After the operation ,
the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in
stable condition. While in the cardiac intensive care unit , her
course was complicated by complete heart block immediately
following surgery. At that time , she had to be paced and
developed a junctional rhythm in the 30s. On postoperative day
#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70&apos;s with occasionally paced
beats. At that time patient was started on no nodal agents of
any kind. Also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it was
found that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit of
packed red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.
On postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to the
cardiac step-down unit. While on the cardiac step-down unit ,
course was complicated by the following: As stated previously ,
the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. She
developed rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 with
heart rates between 100 and 120. Because her epicardial pacing
wires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patient
would benefit from a beta-blocker. Lopressor was started and the
patient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without any
bradycardiac episodes. However , patient continued in and out of
atrial fibrillation for the next two days. On postoperative day
5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. Once the drip was
implemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. When
the diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker was
continued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normal
sinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. Of note , patient was
subtherapeutic on her INR prior to discharge. Her INR will be
closely followed by Greenau Healt Hospital anticoagulation
clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
She was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain , aspirin 81 mg
p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation ,
glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol
XL 150 mg p.o. daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 1 puff inhaler b.i.d. ,
atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Coumadin of which she will
receive 3 mg today.
PLAN:
As stated previously , patient is on Coumadin for her rapid atrial
fibrillation. Goal INR is 2-3. Please draw her INR on 11/28/05
and then daily until therapeutic. Onland Medical Center
anticoagulation clinic will be following her INR. The phone
number is 915-360-5305. The patient is to follow up with Dr.
Swinger , cardiac surgeon in six weeks and Dr. Pfeiffer cardiologist
in two weeks.

Hospital Course:
CV: Based on exam and labs , the patient was felt to be in mild CHF
on admission. She was Rule out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes
x3. Trans-thoracic Echo was done which showed EF of 50-55% with
hypokinesis of anterior and antero-septal wall. Tissue dopplers
suggested diastolic dysfunction , no valvular abnormalities except
trace TR. The patient was started on an ACEI for better BP control ,
no betablocker given h/o asthma. On statin , increased dose to
simvastatin 80. TSH negative. The patient responded well to Lasix IV
diuresis and felt that her breathing was back to baseline after two
days of diuresis.
Pulm: The patient has a history of asthma and OSA; she was continued
on nebs , MDI , O2. Recieved 1 dose of steroids in ED , but these were
not continued since her presentation was more consistent with CHF.
The patient needs CPAP at night , but does not take this at home
since she lost her CPAP machine.
Renal: The patient has a hx of CRI ( 1.5-2.1 ) due to diabetes , her
creatinine was stable between 1.7-1.9 during her admission with
diuresis and the addition of the ACE inhibitor.
HEME: The patient was anemic with a Hct of about 28 on admission. Iron
studies sent which showed Fe of 23 and TIBC of 367 ( transferrin sat
approx 6% ) This is consistent with Fe deficient anemia. The patient&apos;s
Hct subsequently dropped to 24.5 with slightly guaiac pos stool and she
was transfused 2u PRBC with resulting Hct 29.9. The patient has a
family hx of colon cancer and she recently missed colonoscopy in July .

AO screws times three and local bone
graft performed 1/10/92 by Dr. Tim Fajen
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 44 year old Phys. Ed. teacher had
a long history of ankle pain on the
right side. He had a fracture as a child which was fixed with an
open reduction and internal fixation. He sustained a second ankle
fracture a number of years later when he fell off a ladder and
refractured his ankle. Currently , he has pain on all movements of
the ankle while walking and performing any activity. The pain is
primarily in the ankle joint but also in his mid foot. He has been
controlling his pain with Darvocet as well as intramuscular Tordal
15 to 30 mg four times a day. He denies any other joint
involvement and he denies any motor or sensory changes. PAST

currently managed with 32 units of NPH Humulin. He also has a
history significant for hypertension. He denies bowel or bladder
dysfunction , he denies coronary artery disease , dysrrhythmia , or
murmur , he denies peptic ulcer disease , and he denies thyroid gland
abnormality. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for fracture
times two of his right ankle status post open reduction and
internal fixation first time in 1965 and second time in 1988 , he
had herniorrhaphy in 1978 , he had drainage of a right thumb abscess
in 1988 , and he has had septicemia treated at Vensperdon Hospital in
February and September of 1991. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: NPH Insulin
32 units every morning , Procardia XL 90 mg q.a.m. , Lotensin 40 mg
p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium supplement , and then
Ketorolac 15-30 mg intramuscularly q.i.d. , and Darvocet N-100 one
to four tablets q.d. ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
He denies smoking history and he denies ethanol abuse. REVIEW OF
SYSTEMS: Negative for dyspnea on exertion , shortness of breath ,
palpitations , or anginal like symptoms. He does get bilateral leg
edema. He has not had any evidence of neuropathy , retinopathy , or
nephropathies associated with his diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-developed 44 year old male who appears
stated age. HEENT: Demonstrated pupils to
be equal and reactive , extraocular muscles intact , and oropharynx
was clear. NECK: Supple with full painless range of motion and
there was no goiter , adenopathy , or jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Demonstrated a regular
rate and rhythm without significant murmur , rub , or thrill.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-obese , and non-tender without evidence of
hepatosplenomegaly. ORTHOPEDIC: Demonstrated that he had
approximately 10 degrees of dorsiflexion , 10 degrees of plantar
flexion with very limited subtalar motion , good mid foot motion but
with some pain on motion of the mid foot. There was pain during
movement of his tibiotalar joint. Specifically , there was little
pain with motion of the subtalar joint or the mid foot. He had
good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses , he had normal
sensation at the first dorsal web space , dorsum , and plantar
aspects of the foot , and the hindfoot appeared to be in neutral
position. There did not appear to be any supination or pronation
deformities. He had full painless range of motion at the hip and
at the knee on the ipsilateral side.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: X-Rays demonstrated marked degenerative
joint disease with a complete obliteration
of the articular joint space in the lateral half of the joint.
There were also some degenerative changes in the mid foot. His
pre-operative laboratory evaluation demonstrated EKG with normal
sinus rhythm and no evidence of ischemic changes , glucose was 133 ,
BUN was 35 , creatinine 1.2 , potassium of 4.2 , liver function tests
were entirely within normal limits , hematocrit was 42.8 , white
blood cell count was 9 , and the PT and PTT were 11.6 and 28.2
respectively. The patient&apos;s urinalysis was entirely clear for
bacteria and negative for glucose and ketones.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted as a same day surgery
candidate with traumatic arthritis at the right
tibiotalar joint and he underwent tibiotalar fusion with
cross-cannulated AO screws and local bone graft. The procedure
involved partial fibulectomy as well as a partial osteotomy of the
medial malleolus. The position of the ankle at the end of the
procedure was neutral dorsiflexion , plantar flexion , and neutral
varus/valgus. He had a general endotracheal anesthetic for failed
sciatic nerve block , estimated blood loss was 200 cc , and total
tourniquet time was 1 hour and 57 minutes. He received 2500 cc of
crystalloid intraoperatively and he tolerated the procedure well.
Post-operatively , his motor and sensory examinations were intact
with regard to deep and superficial peroneal and posterior tibialis
nerves. His Hemovac put out a total of 150 cc and was removed on
post-operative day number one. He initially was kept in a
posterior splint with anterior wings. This was changed on
post-operative day two. The wound appeared to be clean and dry and
he was placed in a short-leg fiberglass cast since there was little
swelling apparent. He had an X-Ray after placement of the cast and
the position of the ankle looked to be in neutral position and
neutral varus/valgus. He was cleared by Physical Therapy
ambulatory , non-weight bearing , with use of crutches. He did not
have any difficulties with the cast , no significant swelling , and
was discharged on post-operative day three. The patient did have
some elevated temperatures which were attributed to atelectasis and
was encouraged to cough and deep breath.
DISPOSITION: Patient will follow-up with Dr. Norman Dutko in
approximately three weeks at which time the cast will
be changed and stitches removed. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The
medications that he was admitted on with the addition of Vicodan
one to two p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. , Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. as a
substitute for the Tordal , and Halcion 0.125 to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s.

Discharge Date: 10/19/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36 year-old male who
presented with chest pain for one
and one-half hours. In September , 1989 , he developed chest pain and
suffered an inferior myocardial infarction. He had an angioplasty
of his right coronary artery performed at that time. In April ,
1989 , he had more chest pain. Cardiac catheterization indicated
left anterior descending artery lesion. An angioplasty was
attempted and he had abrupt left anterior descending artery
closure , requiring emergent single vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting. He did well until August , 1996 , when he had more
angina. Cardiac catheterization showed a high grade left
circumflex lesion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of the left circumflex was successful. At that time , his cardiac
catheterization also showed that his saphenous vein to left
anterior descending artery graft was patent. His ejection fraction
was 68% by left ventriculogram at that time. In April , 1996 , he
had more chest pain and his cardiac catheterization showed no
significant change compared to his August , 1996 , cardiac
catheterization. One week prior to admission , the patient had
chest pain , which was quickly relieved by one sublingual
nitroglycerin. On the day of admission , while resting , he
developed anterior chest pressure with radiation to his neck ,
associated with some lightheadedness and nausea. There was no
diaphoresis or dyspnea. He took three sublingual nitroglycerin
with minimal relief. He came to the Emergency Room and his pain
resolved after one inch of nitroglycerin paste , 2 milligrams of
intravenous morphine , 325 milligrams of aspirin and supplemental
oxygen. The total duration of his pain was one and one-half hours.
He was then admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were Atenolol 100
milligrams b.i.d.; Cardizem 60 milligrams p.o.
b.i.d.; pravastatin 20 milligrams p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams
q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis C; hypercholesterolemia;
hypertension; coronary artery disease with
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1989.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denied recent orthopnea or PND.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was comfortable and pleasant.
Temperature was 97.8. Blood pressure
124/68. Heart rate 64. Respiratory rate 18. Oxygen saturation
96% on room air. Neck without jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. No murmurs.
Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities no cyanosis ,
clubbing or edema. Rectal occult blood negative.
Chest x-ray was negative by report. Electrocardiogram with pain
showed normal sinus rhythm at 61. Axis was 0. There was no
significant change compared to a September , 1997 , electrocardiogram. His
laboratory studies were notable for a CPK of 103. Liver function
tests were within normal limits. Troponin was 0.0. Hematocrit was
40.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit
with chest pain. He underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol with negative serial CPKs. He had
no events on cardiac monitor. He had no further episodes of chest
pain while in the hospital. On hospital day number two , he
underwent an exercise test. It was a standard Bruce protocol and
he exercised for 9 minutes 1 second , stopping secondary to leg
fatigue. He had no chest pain. His peak heart rate was 131. Peak
blood pressure was 200/100 with no electrocardiographic changes.
His test was read as showing no evidence of ischemia. The patient
was then discharged to home. There were no medication changes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Same as on admission.

Discharge Date: 2/15/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA.
2 ) HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4 ) RECENT DIAGNOSIS OF SLEEP APNEA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year-old male
whose past medical history is
significant for myocardial infarction in 1996 without residual
angina , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and a recent
diagnosis of sleep apnea. He was in his usual state of health
until three days prior to admission when he began to develop a
cough productive occasionally of yellow sputum , dyspnea on exertion
and temperatures to 102 degrees. One day prior to admission , he
went to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed with
pneumonia and given Erythromycin and Ciprofloxacin without
improvement. The following day , he went back to his primary care
provider and was given cough syrup with Codeine , but without relief
and through the course of that day , he developed increasing
shortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented to
the emergency room. In the emergency room , he had a temperature of
100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.
He was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a right
middle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with a
community acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 100.1 degrees ,
blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygen
saturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula. His HEENT
examination was unremarkable. His lung examination revealed
rhonchorous breath sounds throughout with decreased breath sounds
at his bases , right greater than left. He also had diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. His cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallops
or rubs. The abdominal examination was benign. His extremities
revealed no edema. His neurological examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY: His laboratory studies were notable for a chem-7 that
was within normal limits. His CBC revealed a white
blood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a platelet
count of 130. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 with left
atrial enlargement. There were no ischemic changes. His chest
x-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focal
area of consolidation in the right middle lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea
who was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failed
outpatient management. He was initially started on intravenous
Cefuroxime and Azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterial
pathogens and atypical organisms. He was cultured and sputums were
obtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout his
hospital course. On hospital day number two , he developed
increasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly
86% on six liters. At this time , his lung examination was notable
for marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with
decreased air movements. The rest of his examination at this time
including the cardiac examination was unremarkable. This event was
felt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he was
treated with numerous Albuterol nebulizers and intravenous Lasix on
which his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.
Because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhaps
worsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to Legionella
doses of Azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizer
treatments. However , at this time , the possibility of flash
pulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. However ,
it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant for
an episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure was
at baseline. His heart rate was at 70 and he had not become
obviously fluid overloaded. Nonetheless , he received a cardiac
work-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for a
myocardial infarction and the following day , he received an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% with
apical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. There was no marked
left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore , it was thought unlikely
that flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to his
hypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe community
acquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. He was
therefore continued on Cefuroxime and Azithromycin with gradual
resolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his air
movement and his pulmonary examination. Two weeks prior to this
admission , he was started on a Prednisone taper and subsequent
underwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degree
of bronchospasm. Therefore , he was discharged home on the
following medications.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Biaxin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times two
day to complete a long course for
atypical coverage. 2 ) Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
shortness of breath. 3 ) Enteric coated aspirin. 4 ) Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6 ) Prednisone
taper. 7 ) Timoptic one drop o.u. q. PM. 8 ) Cardura one p.o. q.
day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
provider. We have also asked him to follow-up on two
laboratory abnormalities which came back through his
hospitalization and he was noted to have a microcytic anemia and he
had iron studies sent which revealed an iron of 16 and a TIBC of
241. His primary care provider is aware of this and will follow-up
on this as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

ATTENDING: PAWELEK , BENTON FREDERIC MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease , CHF , EF of 15% status
post AVR , history of NSTEMI initially presenting to outside
hospital on 8/19/06 with chief complaint of shortness of breath ,
found to be volume overloaded with a clinical exam and laboratory
findings consistent with heart failure. The patient was found to
have a BNP of 747 as well as a troponin I of 0.43. A repeat echo
at that time revealed an EF of 15% , down from a previous EF of 25
to 35% with a functional aortic valve , moderate-to-severe mitral
insufficiency. A persantine MIBI demonstrated left ventricular
enlargement and three-vessel disease with ischemia in the mid
distal LAD and left circ territory as well as a fixed inferior
wall defect consistent with a right coronary artery infarct. The
patient was diuresed , started on Carvedilol and improved.
Troponins trended down. The patient continued to have frequent
runs of ectopy and SVT. The patient was placed on a heparin drip
and transferred to the Acbroadl Hospital for
catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention. On
admission , the patient reported to be feeling much better , denied
shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient reports
progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past several months ,
inability to lay flat , positive orthopnea and PND , reports
ability to climb two flights of stairs , also reports occasional
palpitations. No fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation ,
diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum or pedal edema. The
patient reports poor compliance with diabetes management , denies
dietary indiscretion , reports medical compliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1994 , coronary artery disease , CHF , cardiomyopathy ,
non-ST-wave MI , status post aortic valve replacement with St.
Jude&apos;s valve , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , anxiety.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 81 , lisinopril 20 ,
Plavix 75 , verapamil 240 sustained release , gemfibrozil 600
b.i.d. , nystatin 500 b.i.d. , Paxil 20 daily , glipizide 10 daily ,
Coumadin 4 prior to admission to outside hospital , Carvedilol
6.25 daily , heparin drip and spironolactone.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently uses tobacco. No alcohol
use. The patient is retired , lives with wife in Lin Con , teaches
graduate courses.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient denies a family history of coronary
artery disease , however , there is hypertension and
cerebrovascular disease in his family.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile ,
heart rate 58 , BP 124/60 , respiratory rate of 20 , saturating 98%
on 2 L. The patient was in no acute distress , lying flat ,
speaking in full sentences. Mucous membranes moist , oropharynx
clear. JVP 12 with bibasilar crackles , left greater than right
and expiratory wheeze with long , pronounced expiratory phase.
Heart , S1 , S2 , prosthetic S2. No murmurs , gallops or rubs
appreciated. Abdomen soft , nontender and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema. DP
intact. Feet are cool but well perfused. Skin warm , dry and
intact , no rashes. The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs notable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of
39.5 , platelets of 113 , cholesterol 157 , triglycerides 76 , HDL
32 , LDL 110 , hemoglobin A1c 6.3 , TSH 1.9. EKG , sinus rhythm ,
left bundle branch block with multiple PVCs , a widened QRS of
duration of 190 milliseconds. Chest x-ray , cardiomegaly
consistent with mild interstitial edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 64-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and NSTEMI ,
CHF with a known EF of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,
presenting through an outside hospital with CHF exacerbation
likely secondary to ischemia.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.
Elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly
secondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. The
patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient was
started on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cath
revealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LAD
stenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%
effused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft to
LAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.
The patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has
improved.
Pump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient was
continued on spironolactone. The patient continued to be
diuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeat
echo in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and
determine the utility of an AICD placement.
Rhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.
However , with the patient&apos;s history of widened QRS and multiple
PVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess the
utility of AICD.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness of
breath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortness
of breath while lying flat on his left side.
3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We will
closely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated with
bicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.
4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to right
heart failure.
5. Heme: The patient&apos;s hematocrit was 39 on admission. It
trended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss
given the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to
38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patient
remaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of
hematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.
His hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he was
asymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was noted
to be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus
will need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patient
continues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.
In addition , the patient suffers from long-term
thrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.
Review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission
to Norpid Memorial Hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior
to heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient&apos;s
platelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatient
evaluation by Hematology.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oral
hypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patient
was controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral
hypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normal
limits.
7. ID: No acute issues.
8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.
9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.
He was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,
which he tolerated well. He will be discharged with a
prescription for the nicotine patch as well.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with PCP and
Cardiology as well as EP. Patient encouraged to check his daily
weights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily
or 3 pounds a week to his PCP. The patient will also follow up
with INR checks as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE APPOINTMENTS: With his PCP , Dr. Qin , telephone
358-190-7457 , on 10/26/06 at 1:45 , Cardiology with Dr.
Mccoyle at 063-315-1331 on 6/2/06 at 3:15 and with
Electrophysiology , Dr. Kunich on 2/6/06 at 10:20. The patient
should arrange to have his INR drawn on 5/29/06 and follow-up
INRs to be drawn every seven days. INRs will be followed by his
PCP.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 p.o. daily.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Dear Mr. Rumpf , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you had a heart attack because your
previous stent was occluded. The interventional cardiologist restented
this vessel in the catheterization lab. Please , it is crucial that you
continue taking your medications as instructed , especially ASPIRIN and
PLAVIX. Please take these medications every day until instructed
otherwise by your doctors. Please weigh yourself daily and keep
records of your weight. If you experience worsening shortness of breath
with exertion or at rest , have chest pain , dizziness , fainting , or
swelling , please call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Titrate Coumadin to goal INR 2-3.
2. ) Pt likely needs CPAP machine at home ( failed sleep study )
3. ) Titrate ACEi ( was previously on ARB ) as tolerated , BB ( now on Toprol
XL 200 , instead of atenolol 25 )
4. ) Likely needs re-eval of LV fxn in 6-8 meeks , AICD/PPM , consider
aldosterone antagonist.

Discharge Date: 7/20/2004
ATTENDING: ELVIS CULBERSON M.D.
DATE OF DISCHARGE: To be determined.
SERVICE: Heart Failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Referred by primary care physician for
increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old male with COPD , CABG ,
ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , CRI , CAD , atrial
fibrillation , distant history of DVT , morbid obesity , presents
with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an
increase in his Lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. He
denies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). He
had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some
initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous
decline since then. He can do his activities of daily living ,
but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his
wheelchair. He went to his primary care physician , Dr. Emil Hattaway who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a
desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the Heart
Failure Service for diuresis and optimization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Morbid obesity.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline 1.6 to 1.9 ).
4. Gynecomastia.
5. Peripheral vascular disease.
6. Coronary artery disease.
7. Diabetes 2.
8. Venous stasis ulcer.
9. COPD.
10. Two-vessel CABG in 1995.
11. Echo in 2003 showing EF of 25% to 30%.
12. Atrial fibrillation.
13. Left leg amputation status post a diabetic ulcer.
14. Peptic ulcer disease.
15. Distant history of DVT.
16. Status post bilateral FEM-POP surgeries.
17. Chronic venous stasis ulcers.
18. History of bilateral diaphragm paralysis.
19. Echocardiogram 4/23/04 showed EF 25% to 30% , akinesis of
the inferior wall , right ventricular function was moderately
reduced , trace aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation ,
mild tricuspid regurgitation , PASP of 36 plus right atrial
pressure.
20. Hemoglobin A1c on 11/29/04 was 5.6.
ALLERGIES: Linezolid.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on
4/13/04 ).
2. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on 11/9/04.
3. Toprol-XL 12.5 mg p.o. q. day.
4. Coumadin as needed for INR of 2 to 3.
5. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Niferex 150 mg p.o. q. day.
7. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.
The following medications have been stopped recently:
1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).
2. Zocor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure
140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on
2 liters. The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but
had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. His JVP was 13
to 14 cm. He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up
his lungs. Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper
sternal border murmur. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended ,
normoactive bowel sounds. He had a left below the knee
amputation , which was warm and clean. Right leg was fully
intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from
the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no
palpable pulses.
LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,
bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. BNP was
473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. White blood cell count 6.2 ,
hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. Chest
x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac
silhouette. EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves ,
normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( which
represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,
consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVH
criteria ).
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but
given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was
negative.
b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. His
admission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix for
diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to
3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterization
which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure
of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting
high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiac
output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was
174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume
overloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of this
dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on
admission.
From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on
hydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were
titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than
120.
c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept
on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being
prepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted on
Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.
2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible
causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and
his underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas was
done with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pH
of 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This is
on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Compared
to his prior ABG in January 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon
dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. This
suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , he
was started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of
comfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , he
will be sent home on home BiPAP.
3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral
effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because
the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be
improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.
4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from
his lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his
legs. They were initially concerned that there could have been a
superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on
levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant
clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin
was discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specific
recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength
Dakin&apos;s soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by
betamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.
There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the
patient&apos;s nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for
concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell
carcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with
atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. This
was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell
carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive
diagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.
5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine
output into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,
this lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.
The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his
own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it
appears to have lightened up. Further followup will be required
likely with Urology as an outpatient.
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which
is well controlled after his recent weight loss. He was
maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary
to his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. The
patient&apos;s creatinine has not increased during the diuresis
process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.
The discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an
addendum at the time of discharge.

Discharge Date: 6/9/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male with
mitral regurgitation and a history of
congestive heart failure , who presents for cardiac catheterization
and a coronary artery bypass graft. He has a history of severe
coronary artery disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
He is status post multiple previous myocardial infarctions and
presents with dyspnea on exertion over the last several months.
However , he denies any frank chest pain. The patient&apos;s cardiac
workup revealed four vessel coronary artery disease and severe
mitral regurgitation. He is preoperatively admitted to the
cardiology service for surgical planning for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;
osteomyelitis; anemia; right 5th and left
third toe amputation; peripheral vascular disease; anemia; chronic
renal insufficiency; status post laminectomy; tobacco and alcohol
use.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin , Lasix , Accupril , Digoxin , Isordil , and
aspirin.
ALLERGIES: To fish , which causes swelling.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Spanish-speaking male in no acute
distress. NECK: No carotid bruits. LUNGS:
Crackles at the bases bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the axilla , with a displaced of PMI. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
non-tender. EXTREMITIES: The femoral pulses are palpable
bilaterally , however , there were no palpable distal pulses. There
was no evidence of any significant varicosities. The left shin is
significant for two small eschars with a minimal rim of erythema.
His lower extremity is consistent with chronic vascular disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for surgical planning.
Previous echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 25-30% , a dilated left atrial size , 4+ MR , and moderate
TR. There was also severe hypokinesis of the inferior posterior
wall of left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization performed on
2/8 showed four vessel disease. Follow-up ABI studies were
stable with the right at 0.68 and the left at 1.61. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant carotid disease to
warrant surgical evaluation.
On 7/23 , the patient was taken to the operating room , where
quadruple coronary artery bypass graft was performed , as well as a
mitral valve repair with a #26 posterior Cosgrove annuloplasty
band. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
to the cardiac surgery ICU.
Postoperatively , the patient&apos;s course was significant for acute and
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejection
fraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. The
patient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. He
was subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after several
days in the ICU. He continued to progress well with the additional
diuresis. His chest tubes and wires were removed without
difficulty. Radiographs showed improvement in bilateral pulmonary
edema.
On the day of discharge , the patient was stable with stable vital
signs. He was afebrile , with no significant leukocytosis. His
renal function had returned to his baseline of around 2.0.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) captopril
25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 3 ) Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.

Discharge Date: 3/5/2001
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA.
3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Testani is a 90+ year-old woman with
a history of hypertension , prior
atrial fibrillation , who presented to the Ie Health on
2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting
several hours at home. She was brought in by her great
granddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly on
an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
At that point she was transferred to Hobert Center
for emergent catheterization. In the emergency room she was
treated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and
heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main
disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent
lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior
descending coronary artery stenosis. The posterior descending
coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual
stenosis of 0 percent. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive
care unit for further monitoring. On admission to the coronary
care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of
breath , and no chest pain. She was noted to have a right groin
hematoma for which pressure was held.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history
of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe
meningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in February of 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10
mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure
140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters
of oxygen. GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acute
distress. Oropharynx is clear. Crackles present bilaterally
throughout both lung fields. CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. No radiation to the neck. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2
plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologic
status intact. Nonfocal exam.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 ,
hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. CK
number one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. CK
number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin
3.49.
Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at
the time pre-catheterization. Rate of 75. Two millimeter ST
segment elevation in leads II , III and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferred
to the coronary care unit after cardiac
catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further
management. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK
was 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. Troponin on admission was
3.49. She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril and
simvastatin. Two days after this initial catheterization on
10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to
diastolic dysfunction. This occurred in the context of her having
a systolic blood pressure of 200. She was then transferred back to
the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of
chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the T
waves laterally. Her CKs continued to trend down however due to
the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and
brought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 for
stenting of the left circumflex lesion. Since the second stent she
continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. Her CKs
continued to trend down. An echocardiogram was done which showed
an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,
moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on this
for one month , Zocor and Lopressor. Due to a rising creatinine
after the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped and
she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine
normalizes.
2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which
increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. The etiology is
deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. Her creatinine is now
improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. This should be
followed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the
hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.
Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.
3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. She did have an
episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood
pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. The goal is to
control the patient&apos;s blood pressure to avoid these episodes.
There is no need for diuresis.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.
She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. She was
transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and
for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at
34. The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on
Prilosec 20 mg q day.
5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down at
night with episodes of confusion and agitation. A psychiatry
consult was obtained and felt that the patient&apos;s behavior was
consistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. The
patient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued
to improve on this medication. She had no episodes of agitation
after being transferred to the floor. In addition she has a
history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a
meningioma. This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in February
of 2000. Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery
would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did
not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status
changes.
6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positive
RPR which has not been treated previously. She is now being
treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
times three injections. She has one injection pending which is due
on 3/5/01. In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture
for neurologic syphilis.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to the
Chora Medical Center with
eventual plans to return to home.
She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. Ernesto Fouch at the Crestsant Health on 2/2/01.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n.
pain , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin 15 cc p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n. cough ,

Discharge Date: 10/24/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. HYPETENSION
3. DYSPEPSIA
4. ADJUSTMENT DISORDER WITH ANXIETY
ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 70 year old white female
status post non Q wave MI in 18 of October , with
thrombolytic therapy and cardiac risk factors of long standing
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and history of tobacco use , who
presents upon transfer from Ra Memorial Hospital with chief
complaint of post MI unstable angina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has the history of
long standing hypertension and has had
chest pain in the past including at least one previous episode of
rule out MI. She was admitted on 26 of March , to Hen Mo Gardensworth Sent Hospital with
signs and symptoms consistent with acute MI , and apparently
received salvage therapy with IV Streptokinase and TPA. Limited
records are available from this hospitalization. The patient
apparently had a submax exercise tolerance test before discharge
which is reportedly unremarkable. Upon discharge from Woodgi Hospital the patient additionally did well and then had three
episodes of typical substernal chest pain with minimal exertion
that were relieved with SL Nitroglycerin.
On 10 of August , the patient presented to Cooker View Home Hospital with an
episode of heavy substernal chest pressure that was similar in
quality to her previous MI. This pain was not relieved with SL
Nitroglycerin. There was no associated shortness of breath ,
nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. In the Ist Medical Center ER , she was
treated with SL and topical nitrates with subsequent relief of her
chest pain. Her presentation was also significant for a chest
x-ray consistent with interstitial edema. Otherwise , her
examination was unremarkable and her EKG showed no worrisome
ischemic changes. She ruled out for MI and on 21 of August , was
transferred to CNMC on IV Heparin , IV Nitroglycerin , beta blockade
and aspirin. At the time of her admission , the patient was without
chest pain and denied other associated symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
18 of October , as above; long standing hypertension ,
75 pack year history of cigarette smoking , hypercholesterolemia ,
chronic dyspepsia , history of positive PPD with normal chest x-ray ,
remote history of breast cancer. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status
post cholecystectomy , status post appendectomy , status post renal
stone removal , status post C. section x 3 , status post breast
lumpectomy. MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: IV Nitroglycerin at 140
micrograms per minute , IV Heparin drip , Lopressor , aspirin one a
day. ALLERGIES: Penicillin which causes anaphylaxis. FAMILY
HISTORY: Negative for premature cardiac disease , negative for
diabetes mellitus. SOCIAL HISTORY: Most significant for her
husband&apos;s recent diagnosis of GI malignancy which will require
inpatient admission at ORMC and the recent death of a brother-in-law
at GH .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese white female in no
apparent distress , pleasant and cooperative.
The vital signs were temp 97.8 , pulse 48 , BP 140/60 , respirations
16 with O2 sat of 95% on O2 2 liters per minute. HEENT exam was
unremarkable. There were normal carotid upstrokes without bruit.
The chest exam showed bibasilar rales right greater than left but
otherwise the lungs were clear to auscultation , no wheezing. CV
exam showed a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds ,
normal S1 and S2 , question of S4 , no appreciable murmurs. The
abdomen was obese , soft with normoactive bowel sounds. There were
previous surgical scars. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly was
noted. There were normal femoral and distal pulses , no peripheral
edema , no peripheral bruits. Neuro exam was unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA: The admission labs showed hematocrit 34.2 , WBC
6.7 , platelets 159 , 000 , PTT 50.0 on IV Heparin.
Urinalysis was essentially within normal limits. Glucose was 110 ,
BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 106 and
bicarb 29. LFT&apos;s were all within normal limits. Admission CK was
32 , albumin 3.9 , magnesium 2.0 , uric acid 6.2 , cholesterol 186. The
chest x-ray was unavailable. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at a
rate of 50 , first degree AV block axis +60 , ST elevation in leads
V2-V4 , poor R wave progression leads V1-V3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient did well over the first 24 hours of
admission. On 29 of November , the patient went to cardiac
cath. Angiogram showed 50% mid circumflex , 60% mid left anterior
descending and only luminal irregularities in the right RCA ,
anterior wall hypokinesis but overall good LV systolic function
with an EF of approximately 72%. Average pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 20 and right atrial pressure 9. Cardiac output was
4.5 with cardiac index of 2.5. Careful review of the cath films
showed no hemodynamically significant lesions felt to be
responsible for the patient&apos;s chest pain. Echo performed on
12 of August , showed left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal LV
systolic function , estimated EF of 50-55% , inferior posterior
hypokinesis , and trace of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation. There
was mild right ventricular hypertrophy and normal estimated
pulmonary artery pressure.
Postcatheterization , the patient showed mild hypertension which was
treated by the addition of a calcium channel blocker , and she was
also diuresed for fluid overload. Prior to discharge , she had two
additional episodes of chest pain that were low in intensity but
prolonged. Each of these required several Nitroglycerins and
antacids to be relieved. It was felt that the chest pain was
unlikely to be cardiac in origin and more likely represented either
GI symptomatology or an anxiety reaction. The patient repeatedly
expressed great concern over her husband&apos;s illness and understood
the possible connection between this and her chest pain. On 7 of August ,
the patient underwent exercise treadmill test on the modified Bruce
protocol. She went 10 minutes and 30 seconds stopping secondary to
fatigue. Maximum heart rate was 108 , maximum BP 164 systolic , no
symptoms and no EKG changes , and the test was interpreted as
showing no evidence for ischemia. The patient was discharged to
home and is to follow up at AMC .
COMPLICATIONS: None. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nifedipine XL 90

Discharge Date: 8/27/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 71 year old male with
coronary artery disease status post a
coronary artery bypass graft times two now presenting with chest
pain. He has had anginal type chest pain for years , never
associated with numbness , nausea , or sweating. Usually , they were
about four times a week but three months ago , he began getting pain
four to five times a day not with any exertion. He has had
decreased exercise tolerance. He takes one to four Nitroglycerin
tablets a day. The day of admission , he felt light headed and had
subsequent substernal chest pain. He took two Nitroglycerin with
no relief and called an ambulance where he had Morphine and
Nitroglycerin with relief. This pain was non-radiating but was
associated with nausea and urge to defecate. He was not quite sure
it was same as his inferior myocardial infarction which he had in
1973. In 1980 , he had a coronary artery bypass graft and again in
1982. Catheterization in 1987 revealed that the grafts were patent
with the native vessels occluded. In 7/25 , he had an echo with
overall contraction normal , there was inferior and posterior
hypokinesis , mild anteroseptal , and diastolic dimension was judged
to be possibly global. In 1993 , he had an exercise tolerance test
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. He went six
minutes and seven seconds with a pulse of 70 and a blood pressure
of 150/70 with typical chest pain. He had a thallium at the same
time and that showed mild non-transmural defect inferiorly with no
ischemia. Also on 9/2/93 , he presented with a cough and had an
abnormal chest X-Ray. He was treated with antibiotics. He denies
any recent cough , fever , chills , or sources for infection. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , status
post a myocardial infarction in 1973 , a coronary artery bypass
graft in 1982 , he is status post a partial gastrectomy thirty years
ago , he had a recent upper respiratory infection in 10/18 , benign
prostatic hypertrophy with four transurethral resection of the
prostate , the last being in 1990 , hypertension , pneumonia in 1976 ,
sigmoid diverticulosis , and benign polyps removed at the S Health Center CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Isordil Tembids four
times a day , Diltiazem 60 mg four times a day , Ativan 1 mg three
times a day , Persantine 50 three times a day , Carafate one q.a.m. ,
Aspirin , and Ativan 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ALLERGIES: He has no
known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former smoker , he
denies any use of tobacco or alcohol , he lives with his wife , and
patient is from Nea Ing Call FAMILY HISTORY: Congestive heart disease
in his father , his mother had died at the age of 42 of cancer of
the stomach , and he has a sister and a maternal aunt who have heart
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was well-developed and well-nourished in
no acute distress with a temperature of 98 ,
pulse of 60 , respirations 16 , and blood pressure 130/70. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light , extraocular
movements were intact , and pharynx was benign. NECK: Supple.
CHEST: Without wheezes or rales of the right greater than the
left. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Examination showed
that he had a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs , the apex was normal , there was no jugular venous distention ,
and carotids were 2+ with no bruits. ABDOMEN: Had normal active
bowel sounds and was soft and non-tender with no hepatomegaly.
RECTAL: Examination was deferred. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
completely intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray revealed that he was status
post a coronary artery bypass graft with
lower lobe infiltrates bilaterally and EKG showed a rate of 50 ,
axis of 0 , intervals were normal , he had early R waves , and he had
questionable ST elevation in V2 , II , III , and F. His creatinine
was 1.4 with a BUN of 24 , glucose of 106 , sodium 138 , potassium
4.3 , chloride 99 , and bicarbonate 31. He had 190 platelets ,
hematocrit of 41 , and a white count of 5.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was assessed as having possible chest
pain and was put on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. The pain was said to be atypical but it was
considered best to rule him out. He was also started on
Ceftriaxone for a possible pneumonia. He had blood cultures times
two taken which subsequently came back normal and a PA and lateral
chest X-Ray , he did not have infiltrates so that was discontinued.
He went on to rule out for a myocardial infarction and he underwent
exercise thallium on which , on a modified Bruce protocol , he went
eight minutes with a heart rate of 93 , blood pressure 150/70 with
no ischemia but chest pain without episode of mild or reversible
defect , and an anterior transmural reversible defect. Patient was
told of his condition and was started on a beta blocker per
Cardiology. In the hospital , patient developed some episodes of
chest pain with EKG normal each time. His stomach had also felt
ascitic lately. Cardiology saw him and did not feel that the pain
was cardiac with a myocardial infarction. He was placed on p.o.
Pepcid for ascitic stomach. Patient tolerated his Inderal he was
started on well and went to 20 mg.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home in stable condition to
follow-up with Dr. Erice DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Ativan p.r.n. , Diltiazem 60 mg four times a day , Inderal 20 mg four
times a day , Hydrochlorothiazide 25 once a day , Aspirin , Persantine
15 three times a day , and Isordil 40 mg four times a day.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: The patient was brought to the ESIH ED by her daughter with the chief
complaint of left leg pain. They were concerned about the healing of her
left fibula/tibia fracture.
---
HPI: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG , chronic kidney
disease ( declined HD ) , congestive heart failure ( EF 30% ) , HTN , and
hypocalcemia. She has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past
two years for CHF exacerbations in the setting of NSTEMI. She has
preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated
discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of
re-hospitalization , and symptom management. In April 2006 she sustained a
displaced LLE tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving
her motorized scooter in her apartment. She has been treated by Dr.
Russel Frausto at PCHCOC . She initally refused surgical repair and was
casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor
healing. She declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate
given her multiple comorbidities. On 11/27/06 the cast was removed by
Dr. Malhotra and has been in a walking boot since then. She states that
she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with Tylenol and
that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.
Her daughter brings her in today because of concern for her mother&apos;s left
leg. The air cast was taken off yesterday and since then , she has had
worsening pain of the leg. She has been unable to move it or bear any
wait. There is a valgus deformity. They are requesting orthopedic
evaluation. She denies new numbness/tingling or weakness in the
extremities. She also notes multiple chronic problems including
decreased appetite with 40lb weight loss over the past 4-6 months ,
lethargy , apathy. &quot;I just want to be able to walk again and do the
things I used to like doing.&quot; ( Going to the horse track , walking
outside. ) She states that she is NOT depressed but sleeps most of the
day.
The family has discussed these symptoms with her PCP. In the past ,
symptoms have been attributed to her worsening renal failure , cardiac
status in this patient who refuses to take any medications. She has
wanted to remain home yet has had documented discussions with PCP about
the benefits of placement to a nursing home for longterm care. Family is
currently looking into assisted living facilities. She also has
requested DNR/DNI status in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: s/p IMI and 2-V-CABG , July of 2001
( LIMA&gt;LAD , SVG&gt;PDA. ) Her anginal equivalents are N/V but not CP. She is
followed by a cardiologist , Dr. Trent Cannizzo at CICGH . She is uninterested
in pursuing any additional cardiac evaluation.
2. CHF with EF 26% ( 5/25 ). Mod-Severe MR. Several exacerbations over
past yr. in setting of NSTEMI ( 3/22 )
3. Hypertension.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 , non-insulin requiring. Her most recent
hemoglobin A1c was less than 6% without medications. Her diabetic
complications include peripheral neuropathy and chronic kidney disease.
5. Chronic kidney disease 2/2 DM with a baseline creatinine of 3.5 to 4.
She has no interest in hemodialysis.
6. Hypocalcemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and profound vitamin
D deficiency with an associated myopathy and bone pain. She also has
severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7. History of colon cancer status post a partial colectomy. The patient
has requested no follow-up for this problem.
8. Osteoarthritis status post a left total hip replacement for aseptic
necrosis. Since that time she has a leg length discrepancy and uses
crutches to ambulate until a recent tib/fib fx which has left her
WC-dependent.
9. Chronic anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease. She does have a
history of prior upper GI bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease.

IMPRESSION:
72F with multiple chronic medical problems s/p recent tib/fib fx
( non-surg mgmt ) admitted for evaluation of her fracture. She was admitted
to medicine for &quot;longterm placement.&quot; Yet upon interview of the family
they intend for Ms. Pall to go home after this hospital stay. From
there , she will transition to assisted living. Over the last few months ,
she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic
kidney disease or cardiac disease. This has led to progressive renal
disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy. The family brings her
in with concerns regarding her left leg. While they do want to
transition to assisted living , they do not intend to place her directly
from DUOMC to RH or Rehab. They hope she will go home after this hospital
stay and continue with VNA/services.
ORTHO: Tib/fib fracture. Non-surgically managed. Followed by Dr.
Alirez Seen by Orthopedic service who discussed the 2 options:
casting with patellar tendon bearing cast or surgery. As before ,
patient declined surgery ( this decision has been supported by her PCP and
cardiologist as she is a high risk surgical candidate. ) There were no
casting technicians in-house this weekend. Therefore she will followup in
the Orthopedics clinic on Wednesday , as instructed by the ortho resident
on call.

50 y.o. female with multiple medical problems
including obesity , IDDM , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , sleep
apnea presents with worsening SOB x 1 month. She reports that
following a pneumonia about 1 year ago , she has
felt progressively short of breath. Over the
past month , her symptoms have become
incerasingly bothersome , interfering with her ability to
talk , walk , and exert herself. She denies
fever/chills/ chest pain/palpitations/PND , but does report
4 pillow orthopnea ( increased from 2 ) , nocturia
( at baseline ). She presented to her pulmonologist
5/6 who felt that her lung disease was
most consistent with restrictive lung disease due
to her obesity. She presented to her allergist
3 days PTA , who felt that she had a CXR
consistent with CHF and increased her lasix to 100 qdx 3 days
with some effect. She presented to her PCP on the
day of admission and was noted to have a decreased
O2 sat; she was sent to TSGH for further evaluation.
Of note , she has many allergies , including latex , was a 1.5 ppd smoker
x 30 years , quit one and a half years ago , and has recently started a
weight loss program , losing 22 pounds in 3
months. In the ED , she was given aspirin ,
solumedrol , nebs , and ativan with some relief. Pertinent exam
findings: markedly obese , labored breathing at times , but speaking
in full sentences. No JVD. Lungs: rare wheezes , few crackles at
bases , no signs of consolidation. CV: distant , RRR , S1 S2
Abd: soft , obese Ext: trace edema , WWP , no calf tenderness. A/P: Pulm:
Likely restrictive component due to obesity as well as deconditioning ,
likely anxiety component as well as possible pulmonary hypertension due
to sleep apnea , smoking hx. Subjectively , acute exacerbation of sx may
also be related to heat/humidity. Nebs for comfort , but primary goal
is for increased cardiopulmonary fitness , weight loss. CPAP for sleep
apnea as well. Outpatient pulmonary rehab. O2 sat 97% on RA with
ambulation prior to d/c. Symptoms improved. CV: continue cardiac
meds , lipid lowering agents. ID: no infectious etiology/sx Endo: Type 2
DM- continue current regimen. Sent HgbA1C.
Pt was discharged home in stable condition she will follow up with her
primary care doctor.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have chest pain , increasing shortness of breath , headache ,
fever , or other worrisome symptoms , please call your doctor or return

Discharge Date: 5/5/1991
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , QUESTION ASTHMA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
IDENTIFICATION DATA: This patient is a 59-year-old white female
with known coronary artery disease , past
history of myocardial infarction admitted 4/9/91 with three weeks
of worsening dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient&apos;s coronary risk factors
include hypertension , elevated
cholesterol , 25-pack-year smoking history and a positive family
history. In 1983 , the patient was admitted to Nocksu Hospital
where she ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with peak
CK of 182 , 7% MB. EKG showed global T wave inversions. The
patient was transferred to Tampnew Hospital where a
cardiac catheterization was performed which showed an 80% proximal
LAD lesion and a 30% mid RCA lesion. The patient was then
transferred to Rocke Elel Word Hospital for PTCA. The angioplasty
procedure was not done. The patient was managed medically and did
well for the next seven years from a cardiac standpoint. She had
only minimal anginal symptoms and shortness of breath during that
period. In April of 1988 , the patient had an echocardiogram
which showed significant LVH , decreased LV compliance , borderline
left atrial enlargement and no regional wall motion abnormalities.
In October of 1991 , the patient had an ETT in which she exercised for
four minutes , 28 seconds achieving a peak heart rate of 103 and a
peak blood pressure of 150/60 , stopping secondary to fatigue and
shortness of breath without chest pain or EKG changes. Also in
October of 1991 , the patient had pulmonary function tests which
showed normal spirometry and lung volumes. On 7/28/91 , the patient
was having progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion
that morning. She presented to Li General Hospital with worsening
dyspnea , wheezing. Her respiratory rate was 30 , and O2 saturation
was 85%. The patient was treated for presumed asthma with
Bronkosol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol. During the second Bronkosol
treatment , the patient developed 2/10 substernal chest pressure
radiating to the left arm which was relieved completely with one
sublingual nitroglycerin. There were no EKG changes. The patient
was transferred to West Hospital where she underwent
a V-Q scan , the results of which showed low probability of
pulmonary embolus. O2 saturation was 95%. The patient was sent
home on Ventolin inhaler. The patient stayed at home for the next
three weeks , symptom-free. On 7/14 , the patient while walking at
the Jose Xingsterka Sno became acutely short of breath with 2/10
substernal chest pressure radiating to the right arm without
nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis or lightheadedness. The chest
pressure and shortness of breath decreased with rest. The patient
then presented to the Adin Hospital and was then transferred to
Dutchessa Hospital . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary
artery disease , status post myocardial infarction as above.
Hypertension. Type II hyperlipidemia. Sjorgren&apos;s syndrome.
History of deep venous thromboses in 1981. Status post IVC
umbrella placement in 1981. Fibrocystic breast disease.
MEDICATIONS: On admission included diltiazem SR , 90 mg b.i.d.;
Ventolin inhaler; aspirin. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of heart attack at age 78. SOCIAL
HISTORY: The patient works as a Bookkeeper at a law firm. She is
divorced with three grown children. She is a 40-pack-year smoker
and stopped one year ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an obese white
female in no apparent distress. Vital signs
revealed a heart rate of 92 , blood pressure 120/70 , respirations
20 , afebrile. Skin and HEENT exams were normal. Chest revealed no
CVA tenderness. Lungs revealed trace inspiratory crackles at both
bases. There were no wheezes heard. Cardiac exam revealed PMI
nonpalpable , regular rate and rhythm. There was a I/VI midsystolic
murmur heard at the left sternal border , no gallops. JVP was not
appreciated. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. Abdomen
was obese , well healed old surgical scars , soft , nontender , no
hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed trace pedal edema and
symmetrical pedal pulses. Neurological exam was nonfocal. Rectal
exam was normal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 137 , potassium
4.5. Chloride was 103. CO2 19. BUN 18.
Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 205 which normalized to 93 the next day.
Hematocrit was 36. White blood cell count was 14.2. Platelet
count 328 , 000. Urinalysis showed trace red blood cells and some
bacteria. EKG while pain free , showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 ,
axis of 40 degrees , intervals 0.21/0.10/0.36 and flat T waves in I
and L. Chest x-ray showed a question infiltrate in the left base
consistent with atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Tu Hospital Emergency
Room where she was tachypneic and wheezing with a
pO2 of 86%. EKG showed only T wave flattening in I and L. The
patient was admitted for presumed asthma and bronchitis and treated
with Bronkosol nebulizers. In the setting of the Bronkosol , the
patient had substernal chest pressure radiating to the left arm.
EKG showed 1 mm of ST depression in I and L and 1 mm ST elevation
in lead III. The pain resolved with three sublingual
nitroglycerin. The pain recurred a few minutes later and was again
resolved with Nitropaste and IV Lopressor. The patient ruled out
for myocardial infarction with CPK&apos;s of 43 , 36 , 37. The patient
was then transferred to the Medical Service and was managed with
diltiazem , Lopressor , Isordil and aspirin. On hospital day number
two , the patient went for echocardiogram which was not obtained
because the patient had developed 5/10 substernal chest pressure
which resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. There were no
EKG changes , the patient was started on heparin with question of
unstable angina at that time. On hospital day number three , the
patient went for cardiac catheterization which showed serial 40 and
50% lesions in the LAD and also an 80% lesion in the distal RCA.
There were no complications post catheterization. It was
questionable whether these lesions were serious enough to account
for the patient&apos;s symptoms. The patient&apos;s medical regimen was
advanced and she has tolerated that well and has been symptom free
for the past 48 hours. She was discharged home in stable
condition. She will follow-up with Dr. Gagne in one week. The
patient also had asymptomatic pyuria and bacteruria and was treated
for a presumed urinary tract infection with three days of oral
Bactrim.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included diltiazem SR ,
120 mg po b.i.d.; Lopressor , 100 mg b.i.d.; Isordil ,
20 mg t.i.d.; aspirin , one q day.

ASSESSMENT: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension , CHF , status post a mitral valve/tricuspid valve
repair in mid September , complicated by postoperative C. diff
colitis and UTI who presented with persistent diarrhea and three
days of fever , chills and chest pain. The patient&apos;s fatigue was
most likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C.
diff related diarrhea. Over the course of her hospitalization ,
it became clear that she experienced chest pain during her
intermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. Now that her NSVT
is under better control , she is chest pain-free.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin and gemfibrozil. She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 and
ruled out by biomarkers.
Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. She was rehydrated
with normal saline. The patient developed shortness of breath on
hospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. She was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Electrolytes were repleted twice
daily. She was then transitioned to 40 of Lasix p.o. daily and
finally per cardiology recommendation 20. She will be discharged
to home on 20 b.i.d. p.o.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. On
hospital day #2 , she developed atrial fibrillation with
hypotension most likely secondary to Diltiazem , which was
subsequently held. The patient&apos;s blood pressure improved
dramatically with gentle IV hydration on hospital day #2. Her
Diltiazem will be discontinued. The patient is on Coumadin now
with therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. Per cardiology , her
beta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she was
transitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistent
nocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quite
frightening to her. Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone
400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge and
then the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily.
At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily ,
her discharge dose. Echocardiogram was ordered on the day of
discharge per cardiology. See LMR for formal report.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diff
colitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic use
presented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever.
Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.
She had one C. diff positive stool. Stool became C. diff
negative as of 9/2/06. Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dual
therapy. She will be discharged with seven more days of
antibiotics to complete.
3. Endocrine: The patient on home dose Synthroid. TSH
initially low , however , rechecked and found to be within normal
limits. Continue home dose of Synthroid.
4. Heme: The patient&apos;s hematocrit was stable throughout her
hospitalization. Continue Niferex at home dose , continue
Coumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient had a low pretest probability for PE.
Given her allergy to IV contrast , she was not a candidate for
PECT; however , a V/Q scan was obtained on 1/19/06. The result
was low probability for pulmonary embolism. Her respiratory exam
improved greatly on b.i.d. Lasix.
6. Renal. The patient&apos;s creatinine was stable throughout her
hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: Coumadin with therapeutic INR plus proton pump
inhibitor.
8. FEN: The patient was initially started on a clear liquid
diet. On hospital day #3 , she began to eat solid foods and
tolerated well.
9. Code status: The patient was a full code throughout her
hospitalization.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Continue home medications as indicated.
2. Continue vancomycin and Flagyl for 7 more days.
3. VNA instructed to draw INR on Thursday , 2 days post-discharge

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Dr. Lucius Rathmanner
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS FOR ADMISSION:
Asthma exacerbation.
LIST OF PROBLEMS DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
1. Asthma exacerbation.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Iron deficiency anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 38-year-old female with a history of asthma , type II
diabetes mellitus , obesity , depression , and iron deficiency
anemia who presented to Erta Memorial Hospital on 3/9/06
complaining of worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness
over the past three days after running out of her asthma
medications approximately two weeks ago. The patient had ran out
of her Advair , albuterol , and Singulair as well as her Lasix.
She denied any fevers or chills , no nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
chest pain , or cough. She did report some increased lower
extremity edema over the past several days and admits to not
taking her Lasix. She went to SWORTHLATE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER urgernt care on the day of admission and was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 84% on room air and she was
sent to the Emergency Room for admission. In the ED , she
received nebulizer treatments and prednisone 60 mg x1 and her O2
saturation improved to 95% on 2 liters.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
The patient takes Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , albuterol nebulizers
q.4h. p.r.n. , iron 325 mg t.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily , Lasix
40 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , metformin 850 mg
b.i.d. , Prozac 40 mg daily , Singulair 10 mg daily , and a
multivitamin daily.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Pertinent for shortness of breath and chest tightness.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Exam on admission , patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 100 ,
blood pressure 116/70 , respiratory rate 22 , and O2 saturation of
95% on 2 liters. The patient was awake , alert and oriented x3
and in no apparent distress. Her lungs had scattered wheezing
bilaterally with good air movement. Heart with normal S1 , S2 and
tachycardic. Abdomen is obese , soft , nondistended , nontender.
Extremities had 1+ bilateral pitting edema and mild erythema of
her bilateral shins.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
White blood cell count was 10.6 and hematocrit 30. Chest x-ray
showed a large cardiac silhouette with no evidence of effusion or
infiltrate. The patient had a PE protocol CT which was a
suboptimal study due to poor body habitus but it was negative for
PE , it did show bilateral ground glass opacities and evidence of
air trapping. It also showed moderate hepatomegaly.
PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
The patient had a PECT and she also had pulmonary function tests
performed.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 38-year-old female with asthma , diabetes , anemia , and
morbid obesity who was admitted with his asthma exacerbation in
the setting of running out of her medications at home.
1. Pulmonary: The patient was started on prednisone 60 mg p.o.
daily and remained on it for approximately seven days. It was
difficult to taper her prednisone due to oxygen desaturations
with ambulation. The patient&apos;s oxygen desaturated to 74-84% with
ambulation. The patient , however , was tapered and is currently
on 50 mg daily , of prednisone and will be sent out on a seven-day
taper. She was also continued on her Advair and Singulair. As
mentioned above , she had a PE protocol CT that showed no PE.
However , it was a suboptimal study due to patient&apos;s body habitus.
It did show ground glass opacities. Because the patient had
desaturations with ambulation , it was concerned that the patient
possibly had an atypical pneumonia given these ground glass
opacities. She was started on levofloxacin and should complete a
five-day course. The patient was also tested for HIV which was
negative. She had a BNP to rule out any evidence of volume
overload that was contributing to her oxygen desaturations. BNP
was 5. The patient also had hepatitis serologies due to
hepatomegaly seen on PECT and these were negative as well.
Influenza swabs were negative. The patient was seen in consult
by the pulmonary team and they felt that the patient requireed
home oxygen especially at night and with ambulation. The
patient&apos;s O2 saturation while sleeping was 84%. It is highly
suspected that the patient has a component of sleep apnea and she
is to be set up for an outpatient sleep study. Pulmonary also
recommended obtaining a pulmonary function test. These were done
and it showed an FVC of 51% and an FEV1 of 49% and an FEV-FVC
ratio of 97% as well as a total lung capacity of 53% and a DLCO
of 82%. Pulmonary function tests were consistent with
restrictive disease and this is likely due to patient&apos;s obesity.
The patient most likely has obesity hypoventilation. We spoke
with her in depth about the importance of losing weight to help
improve her respiratory status as well as her overall health.
The patient is scheduled to have an outpatient sleep study and
she is also to follow up with her outpatient pulmonologist , Dr.
Dworaczyk Home oxygen was set up for the patient as well.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on her lisinopril
and her Lasix was resumed for her lower extremity edema. This
did improve throughout her hospitalization. A lipid panel was
checked and this was in the normal range. The patient should be
started on aspirin given her diabetes and her hypertension.
However , she has been experienced menorrhagia and is anemic so
the aspirin should be started as an outpatient after her
menorrhagia is addressed.
3. Hematology: The patient was found to be iron deficient by
labs and she was continued on iron supplements three times a day.
The patient also complains of heavy menstruation and she has a
history of uterine fibroids , she was supposed to follow up with
GYN as an outpatient but missed her appointment. She was
instructed to follow up with GYN.
4. Endocrine: The patient&apos;s home medications of glyburide and
metformin were held and she was placed on NPH 25 units b.i.d.
with a NovoLog sliding scale and 12 units q.a.c. Her hemoglobin
A1c was 7. She was resumed on her home regimen at discharge.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient received Lovenox and Nexium for
prophylaxis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was awake , alert , oriented x3. She is 95% on room
air at rest but did continue to desaturate into the 80s with
ambulation. She is awake , alert , oriented x3. Her lungs were
clear bilaterally. There were no other pertinent findings on
exam at discharge.
CONSULTANTS DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
Pulmonary was Dr. Koeppl
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was sent home on albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ,
ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Prozac 40 mg p.o. daily ,
Advair Diskus 500/50 one puff b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Levaquin 750 mg p.o. daily , x1 more
dose , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , metformin 850 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily , and a
prednisone taper 40 mg daily x2 days , then 30 mg daily x2 days ,
then 20 mg daily x2 days , then 10 mg daily x2 days , then stopping
it and multivitamin one tablet daily.
