Dopamine was weaned off .\nThe electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .\nShe had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .\nHer only medication was Dyazide .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nShe was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .\nThe pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .\nThe respirations 18 and she was afebrile .\nThe jugular veins were not distended .\nThe carotids were full .\nThere were no bruits .\nThe chest was clear with distant breath sounds .\nThe cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .\nThere were no rubs .\nThe abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .\nThere was no peripheral edema .\nThere were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .\nThere was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .\nHer electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .\nThe cholesterol was 171 .\nTriglycerides 103 .\nBy this time her CK was 600 .\nHer hematocrit was 37.1 .\nHemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .\nThe PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .\nReview of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .\nShe was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .\nShe was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .\nShe became increasingly disoriented .\nShe developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .\nThe chest films showed mild cephalization .\nShe became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .\nShe went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .\nShe had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .\nCatheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .\nThe right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .\nShe had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .\nShe continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .\nShe remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .\nDobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .\nShe was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .\nShe was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .\nEventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .\nShe had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .\nShe was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .\nThe BUN rose to 91 .\nHer Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .\nShe was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .\nEfforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .\nThe right ventricular function was normal .\nAfter extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .\nThe patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .\nThere was no structural abnormality .\nMoistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .\nShe continued a rather slow improvement .\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .\nThe possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .\nShe had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\nRenal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .\nShe had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .\nThat can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .\nBecause of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .\nThis was followed up and was shown to resolve .\nMR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .\nA MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .\nShe was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .\nSHASQUALENA R.
